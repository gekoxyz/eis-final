In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the city council said 17 were killed but later revised that down to 12. The city council secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said rockets struck the city overnight, and that at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings had been damaged. At least 40 people were admitted to hospital and dozens more were being treated for moderate to light injuries, Kurtev posted on his Telegram channel.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and </strong><strong>carried out the “merciless” strikes on </strong><strong>Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible.</strong> In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The blasts that killed at least 12 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said.</strong> The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> but declined to make a direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea.</strong> The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Russian invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities have said. </strong>In an interview with the Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artefacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,170 sq km (450 sq miles) of land in its southern Kherson region since launching the start of its counter-assault against Russia in late August, a military spokesperson said. </strong>Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnipro river has taken longer, Reuters reports. Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, the latest UK intelligence update sa</strong><strong>id.</strong> The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday; that he personally sponsored and opened the bridge; and that its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russian divers </strong><strong>were due on Sunday to examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea\">Crimea</a> to

Here is what you might have missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said.</strong> Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy</strong><strong> has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible.</strong> In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, the latest UK intelligence update says.</strong> The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea\">Crimea</a> to Russia.</strong> Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Saturday tightening security for the Kerch bridge</strong> and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia after the explosion that crippled the heavily guarded bridge. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, is in charge of the effort. By Saturday evening, Russia said the rail link across the bridge was operational again but road traffic would remain constricted.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An adviser to </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Zelenskiy</a> said the explosion on the Kerch bridge was just “the beginning”.</strong> Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.” Three people were killed on Saturday after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge, Russian officials said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> could receive all the supplies they needed</strong> via existing land and sea corridors, said Russia’s defence ministry after the Kerch bridge explosion<strong>.</strong> The road-and-rail bridge has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of Ukraine’s south.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge blast </strong>but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire,” David Arakhamia wrote on Telegram. “The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</strong> Sergei Surovikin is a notorious general who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/russia-appoints-notorious-general-sergei-surovikin-ukraine\">opened fire on pro-democracy protesters</a> in the 1990s.

Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, is in charge of the effort. By Saturday evening, Russia said the rail link across the bridge was operational again but road traffic would remain constricted.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An adviser to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> said the explosion on the Kerch bridge was just “the beginning”.</strong> Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.” Three people were killed on Saturday after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge, Russian officials said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> could receive all the supplies they needed</strong> via existing land and sea corridors, said Russia’s defence ministry after the Kerch bridge explosion<strong>.</strong> The road-and-rail bridge has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of Ukraine’s south.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge blast </strong>but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire,” David Arakhamia wrote on Telegram. “The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</strong> Sergei Surovikin is a notorious general who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/russia-appoints-notorious-general-sergei-surovikin-ukraine\">opened fire on pro-democracy protesters</a> in the 1990s. He led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops were involved in “very tough fighting” near Bakhmut</strong>, a strategically important eastern town Russia is trying to take. Reuters reported that while Ukrainian troops had recaptured thousands of square kilometres of land in recent offensives in the east and south, officials say progress is likely to slow once Kyiv’s forces meet more determined resistance. Zelenskiy<strong> </strong>said in his nightly address: “We are holding our positions in the Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where it is very, very difficult now – very tough fighting.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, said the diesel generators at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had only a limited supply of fuel.</strong> Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. The United Natoins atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at the plant, condemning the shelling as “tremendously irresponsible”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/3588962-ukraines-economy-cut-by-onethird-over-nine-months.html\">ministry of economy said</a> on Saturday. <strong>“</strong>Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out,” it said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> conflict</strong>, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions</strong>, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security</strong>, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, Reuters reported.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the UN general assembly</strong> next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly.

Here’s where things stand: The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US president Joe Biden spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its partial mobilization “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings that will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that a power line that was cut yesterday by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored. Ukraine’s national police said on Sunday that authorities had exhumed the first 20 bodies from makeshift graves in the recently liberated city of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its eighth month, is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities say. Associated Press reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artifacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros (dollars), the minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, added. “The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime,” he said. For the moment, Ukraine’s government and its Western backers supplying weapons are mostly focused on defeating Russia on the battlefield. But if and when peace returns, the preservation of Ukrainian collections of art, history and culture also will be vital, so survivors of the war can begin the next fight: rebuilding their lives. “These are museums, historical buildings, churches. Everything that was built and created by generations of Ukrainians,” Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, said in September when she visited a Ukrainian museum in New York. “This is a war against our identity.” Austria’s ministry of foreign affairs has condemned Russia’s recent attacks in Zaporizhzhia that has killed at least 13 people. The ministry called the attacks “utterly unacceptable and must stop,” adding that “those responsible must be held to account.” The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the US president, Joe Biden, spoke by phone on Sunday and agreed the Kremlin’s latest nuclear threats were “irresponsible” and its part mobilisation “a serious mistake”, according to a German government statement, Reuters reports. The nearly one-hour telephone call was focused on preparations for the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings, which will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequences, the statement said. The two leaders agreed never to accept Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, calling it a further escalation, the statement said. They agreed that Russia’s part mobilisation showed the “bitter price” Russians were having to pay for the miscalculations of Vladimir Putin. “They criticised the latest nuclear threats of Moscow as irresponsible and agreed such a step would have exceptionally serious consequences for Russia,” the statement said. On the topic of the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, the two leaders agreed the sabotage of critical infrastructure would be dealt with decisively, it said. A White House statement reaffirmed the talks between Scholz and Biden, saying: The leaders reiterated their condemnation of Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory, as well as their ongoing commitment to hold Russia accountable for its brutal actions and provide security and economic assistance to Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the explosion on a key bridge linking Crimea and the Russian mainland was a terrorist act planned by the Ukrainian special services. In a video address on the Kremlin’s Telegram channel on Sunday, Putin said: “There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure … This was devised, carried out and ordered by the Ukrainian special services.” Putin was meeting Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s investigative committee, who was presenting findings of an inquiry into Saturday’s explosion and fire on the Kerch bridge. Russia’s FSB security service said on Sunday it had seen a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, claiming one person had been killed and five wounded over the past week. Agence France-Presse reports: Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security. The attacks have concentrated on the Russian region of Belgorod, near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, as well as Bryansk and Kursk, the FSB said. It said that in the past week “more than 100 bombardments were recorded in 32 localities, with the use of multiple rocket launchers, artillery, mortars and drones”. A child was among those wounded, the FSB said, adding that the attacks also “destroyed two electricity stations, 11 residential buildings and two administrative buildings”. A Russian drone killed a civilian in Sumy oblast on Sunday, Euromaidan has reported. According to the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, the victim was standing next to a store in the Myronivska community. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that a power line that was cut yesterday by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored. Ukraine’s national police said on Sunday that authorities had exhumed the first 20 bodies from makeshift graves in the recently liberated city of Lyman, in the eastern Donetsk region. It is coming up to 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will hold a meeting of his security council on Monday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said. It comes after an explosion on Saturday caused the collapse of part of a bridge linking the Crimean peninsula with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have revised the death toll from the Russian shelling of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia down from 17 to at least 12. The blasts blew out windows in adjacent buildings and left at least one high-rise apartment building partly collapsed. In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the city council said 17 were killed but later revised that down to 12. The city council secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said rockets struck the city overnight, and that at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings had been damaged. At least 40 people were admitted to hospital and dozens more were being treated for moderate to light injuries, Kurtev posted on his Telegram channel. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and carried out the “merciless” strikes on Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The blasts that killed at least 12 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four that Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined to make a direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine is being accompanied by the destruction and pillaging of historical sites and treasures on an industrial scale, Ukrainian authorities have said. In an interview with the Associated Press, Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artefacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added. Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,170 sq km (450 sq miles) of land in its southern Kherson region since launching the start of its counter-assault against Russia in late August, a military spokesperson said. Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnipro river has taken longer, Reuters reports. Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday; that he personally sponsored and opened the bridge; and that its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian divers were due on Sunday to examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (3am GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be completed by the end of the day.

Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnipro river has taken longer, Reuters reports. Southern military command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said that Ukraine was making progress on the Kherson front, but that a lot needed to be done to secure newly recaptured territories. She said on Ukrainian television: Work is continuing on consolidation of territory, clearing it and conducting stabilising operations, as the settlements we enter contain many surprises left by the (Russian) occupiers As of today, from the beginning of the counter-offensive, over 1,170 sq km have been liberated in the Kherson direction. Ukrainian officials have long talked up the priority of recapturing Kherson, a flat, agricultural region which Moscow captured in its near-entirety in the early days of its invasion. Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm Ukraine but declined direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea. National security spokesman John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge. What I can tell you is that Mr Putin started this war, and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country. Kirby said both sides needed to find a way to negotiate an end to the war but that Putin had shown no interest in doing so. He added: Quite the contrary. By calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, by politically annexing, or at least trying to annex four areas of Ukraine, he has shown every indication that he is doubling down. This, said Kirby, “is why, quite frankly, we are in touch almost daily with the Ukrainians and we’re going to continue to provide them security assistance.” These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Nicole Stybnarova, a lecturer in public international law at the University of Oxford, has written for us to argue that Putin’s war is illegal – and Russians fleeing the draft may have the right to asylum: Russian software architect “AA” was one of 17,000 people who fled Russia for Finland last weekend. This was before Finland closed its border with Russia, which was the last direct route from Russia to the European Union. AA told Finnish journalists that Russia was establishing “call-up centres or contact points” on the other side of the border, preventing people from leaving and funnelling them into the armed forces. Apparently, no authority on either side of the borders between Russia and the EU is now interested in the fate of ordinary Russians who refuse to fight in the criminal invasion of Ukraine.

According to the government department, 62,500 Russian soldiers have been killed and 5,133 armoured personnel vehicles destroyed or captured. Vladimir Putin’s forces have also lost 1,477 artillery systems, 266 aircraft, 235 helicopters and 2,486 tanks. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these numbers. The blasts that killed at least 17 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said. The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four Russia claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control. Emma Graham-Harrison and Charlotte Higgins report for us in Lviv: In a time of violence, warfare and bloodshed, what is the use of literature? This was a question addressed at the Lviv BookForum, a three-day literary festival in the Ukrainian city, staged despite – and in defiance of – the Russian invasion. The festival has brought together Ukrainian, British and international authors including human rights lawyer Philippe Sands, whose bestselling book, East West Street, is largely set in 20th-century Lviv. Ukrainian writer Oleksandr Mykhed told audiences that at the moment of the invasion, he realised: “You could not protect your family from a rifle with your poems. You could not hit someone with a book, you could try but it won’t work with the crazy occupiers from Moscow. I lost belief in the power of culture, lost interest in reading.” Read more: ‘People need to tell stories’: Lviv holds literary festival in defiance of war Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, has urged western countries to provide air and missile defence systems following Russian shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Peter Beaumont reports for us from Kyiv: At least 17 people have been killed by Russian shelling of a residential area in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a region that the Kremlin illegally claims to have annexed despite not controlling all of it. The overnight attack happened in the aftermath of a devastating explosion on the key bridge linking Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland, a prestige project of the president, Vladimir Putin. The blast seriously damaged the 12-mile-long (19km) structure, which serves as an important military supply route. The Zaporizhzhia strike came as Ukrainians – jubilant over the damage to the Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of Putin’s ambitions – were bracing for a major retaliation by Moscow, which had warned Kyiv against targeting the structure.

In an interview with the Associated Press (AP), Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, alleged that Russian soldiers helped themselves to artefacts in almost 40 Ukrainian museums. The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added. He said: The attitude of Russians toward Ukrainian culture heritage is a war crime. Mariupol’s exiled city council said Russian forces pilfered more than 2,000 items from the city’s museums. Among the most precious items were ancient religious icons, a unique handwritten Torah scroll, a 200-year-old bible and more than 200 medals, the council said. Also looted were artworks by painters Arkhip Kuindzhi, who was born in Mariupol, and Crimea-born Ivan Aivazovsky, both famed for their seascapes, the exiled councillors said. The UN’s cultural agency is keeping a tally of sites being struck by missiles, bombs and shelling. With the war now in its eighth month, the agency says it has verified damage to 199 sites in 12 regions. They include 84 churches and other religious sites, 37 buildings of historic importance, 37 buildings for cultural activities, 18 monuments, 13 museums and 10 libraries, Unesco said. The time is just past 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest. Zelenskiy has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”. The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day. Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Saturday tightening security for the Kerch bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia after the explosion that crippled the heavily guarded bridge. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, is in charge of the effort. By Saturday evening, Russia said the rail link across the bridge was operational again but road traffic would remain constricted. An adviser to Zelenskiy said the explosion on the Kerch bridge was just “the beginning”. Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.” Three people were killed on Saturday after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge, Russian officials said. Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine could receive all the supplies they needed via existing land and sea corridors, said Russia’s defence ministry after the Kerch bridge explosion. The road-and-rail bridge has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of Ukraine’s south. The parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge blast but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire,” David Arakhamia wrote on Telegram. “The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode.” Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin is a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s. He led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops were involved in “very tough fighting” near Bakhmut, a strategically important eastern town Russia is trying to take. Reuters reported that while Ukrainian troops had recaptured thousands of square kilometres of land in recent offensives in the east and south, officials say progress is likely to slow once Kyiv’s forces meet more determined resistance. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address: “We are holding our positions in the Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where it is very, very difficult now – very tough fighting.” Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, said the diesel generators at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had only a limited supply of fuel. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. The United Natoins atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at the plant, condemning the shelling as “tremendously irresponsible”. Ukraine’s GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy said on Saturday. “Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out,” it said. France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building. The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, Reuters reported. The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the UN general assembly next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in Ukraine and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly. The general assembly is set to vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation”. The latest pictures from the Russian shelling of housing in Zaporizhzhia that has reportedly killed at least 17 people. Slovakia’s defence minister, Yaroslav Nad, has tweeted that two Zuzana howitzers have been sent to Ukraine. He said: To celebrate his 70th birthday, we gave the aggressor Putin another gift. Two more new Zuzana 2 howitzers are already in Ukraine (and much more to come). Andrew Roth reports for us from Moscow: Russia has appointed a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s as its first overall commander for the war in Ukraine, as the Kremlin struggles to halt a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has left its forces in disarray. The appointment of Gen Sergei Surovikin came on the same day as Vladimir Putin was dealt a humiliating blow after an explosion on the Kerch bridge sank a section of the motorway into the Kerch Strait and caused a major fire on the railway. Surovikin is a veteran commander who led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using “controversial” tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters.

The tweet adds that if Ukrainian military forces “had modern anti-missile systems, we could have prevented such tragedies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible. In a post on his Facebook page, he said: Zaporozhye again. Again merciless strikes on civilians. In residential buildings, just in the middle of the night. There are already 12 dead. 49 injured in hospital, 6 of them children. The absolute meanness of all. Absolute evil. Inhumans and terrorists. From the one who gave this order, and to all who followed this order. They will be held accountable. A must. Before the law and before the people. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv and Pjotr Sauer report: As a chilly autumn dawn broke on Saturday over the Kerch bridge linking Russia-occupied Crimea to the mainland, the road traffic was light. With the sky turning pink, a few cars and several lorries were making their way across the bridge, which is about 12 miles (19km) long and before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was used by 15,000 cars a day, A little way distant and above the cars, a long cargo train carrying tankers of fuel among its wagons was also making its way towards the peninsula across the parallel railway bridge. The blast, when it came at 6.07am (3.07 GMT), was devastating. CCTV footage posted on Russian Telegram channels showed a car and a lorry moving almost together when a vast fireball engulfed them, orange mixed with a storm of white-hot fragments swirling around the span.

The Kerch bridge, a hated symbol of the Kremlin’s occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula, was built in 2018. Footage shared on Russian Telegram channels and news agencies appeared to show the moment of the explosion with two vehicles, a truck and a car, at the centre of the blast, although it was unclear whether either was responsible or simply caught up in the detonation At least 12 people were killed and 49 hospitalised, including six children, as a result of the shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the region’s governor says. A nine-storey building was partially destroyed overnight, five other residential buildings levelled and many more damaged in 12 Russian missile attacks on the city in south-east Ukraine, Reuters quoted Oleksandr Starukh as saying. The governor said on Telegram: There may be more people under the rubble. A rescue operation is under way at the scene. Eight people have already been rescued. City official Anatoliy Kurtev had said earlier that at least 17 people were killed when missiles hit a high-rise apartment complex and buildings. Russian divers will on Sunday examine the extent of damage from the blast on the Kerch bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Russian news agencies quoted the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, as saying the divers would start work on Sunday at 6am (0300 GMT), with a more detailed survey above the waterline expected to be complete by the end of the day. The work came as the Kremlin-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said: Of course, emotions have been triggered and there is a healthy desire to seek revenge. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv has the full story: The damage from Saturday’s explosion on the Kerch bridge in Crimea could have a “significant” impact on Russia’s “already strained ability to sustain its forces” in southern Ukraine, the latest UK intelligence update says. The Ministry of Defence said the blast “will likely touch President Putin closely” for reasons including that it came hours after his 70th birthday, he personally sponsored and opened the bridge, and its construction contractor was a childhood friend. The ministry said the bridge’s rail crossing had played a key role in moving heavy military vehicles to the southern front during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The extent of damage to the rail crossing was uncertain, it said, but any serious disruption to its capacity would be “highly likely” to significantly affect Russian forces in Ukraine’s south. Some officials in Moscow and in Russian-occupied Ukraine have called for retaliation over the explosion that heavily damaged the Kerch bridge linking Crimea and Russia on Saturday. “There is an undisguised terrorist war against us,” Russian ruling party deputy Oleg Morozov told the RIA Novosti news agency. Agence France-Presse quoted a Russian-installed official in the occupied Ukrainian Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, as saying: Everyone is waiting for a retaliatory strike and it is likely to come. Military analysts said the blast could have a major impact if Moscow saw the need to shift already hard-pressed troops to the Crimea from other regions or if it prompted a rush by residents to leave. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that even if Ukrainians were not behind the blast, it constituted “a massive influence operation win for Ukraine”. He said on Twitter: It is a demonstration to Russians, and the rest of the world, that Russia’s military cannot protect any of the provinces it recently annexed. Shelling in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia has killed at least 17 people, city official Anatoliy Kurtev has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said preliminary figures suggested 17 dead and 40 wounded after an attack on residential housing. “The Russians are not able to respond on the battlefield and therefore hit the cities in the rear,” he said. The city lies 125km (80 miles) from the Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe’s largest. Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Saturday tightening security for the Kerch bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia after the explosion that crippled the heavily guarded bridge.

The Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the impact of the invasion of Ukraine to the cost of living crisis, an issue where many Conservative MPs want to see more robust action from ministers. Starmer called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson argued against a windfall tax and said existing efforts to help with energy bills were generous. Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” The government, Starmer said, should be “starting a new era of energy policy, never again at the mercy of a dictator”, including more nuclear power, “sprinting” for more renewables, and rapid moves to insulate homes. “So why is the prime minister offering the same failed energy policy that cast us into the security crisis and allowed bills to rocket?” Starmer asked. Johnson argued the government had already introduced “unprecedented measures” to help with bills, including a one-off £200 loan to offset energy costs and £150 for some households towards council tax. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas.

                    "bodyText": "The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Japan to increase pressure on Russia by imposing a trade embargo on Russian goods, in a virtual address to MPs in Tokyo. Zelenskiy, who has delivered carefully tailored speeches to lawmakers in the US, UK and other countries, thanked Japan for “leading the way” among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and imposing sanctions. “Responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment, for real assistance to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Wednesday in the first address of its kind to Japanese lawmakers. “You were the first in Asia who really began to put pressure on Russia to restore peace, who supported sanctions against Russia, and I urge you to keep doing this.” In a later address to French MPs he called on French companies including Renault and the supermarket group Auchan to leave Russia. He compared the destruction of Mariupol with “the ruins of Verdun as in the photos of the first world war that everyone has seen”. Zelenskiy claimed in his address to Japanese MPs that Russian forces were preparing to use chemical weapons and launch new attacks from the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which Russian troops occupied last month in the early stages of the invasion. He offered no details, but said four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were in a “dangerous” state. The Chernobyl plant suffered a catastrophic accident 25 years before the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in north-east Japan, although Zelenskiy did not mention Fukushima in his address. Japan has joined international sanctions against the Kremlin and offered humanitarian assistance. Its sanctions on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia cover defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport. It has also said it will revoke Russia’s trade status of most favoured nation. Japan has also accepted a small number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and voiced a willingness to take more – a gesture that surprised many given its usually strict rules on refugees and asylum seekers. In response, Russia has labelled Japan an “unfriendly” country and this week said it was suspending negotiations over a longstanding territorial dispute that has prevented the two countries from signing a postwar peace treaty. Japan and Russia both lay claim to the Kuril islands – known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which were invaded by Soviet forces towards the end of the second world war. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, last week said Russia was “illegally occupying” the islands, located near Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. “We also have to think about Ukraine’s recovery after the war, about the people who have been forced from their homes and their strong desire to return home,” Zelenskiy said. I think the people of Japan understand that feeling.” Zelenskiy had angered some conservative Japanese MPs when he invoked Pearl Harbor in appealing for more help from the US in a recent address to Congress. “Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of 7 December 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” Zelensky said last week. “Just remember it, remember, September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment.” On Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation after his 12-minute address, which he ended by thanking his audience in Japanese.",

Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. The Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can.

Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-to-freeze-energy-bills-price-at-2500-a-year-funded-by-borrowing\">ruled out extending</a> the £5bn energy tax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">introduced by</a> the former chancellor Rishi Sunak.</p> \n<p>Unlike the UK, the EU is also moving ahead with plans to reduce demand for energy. Ministers agreed on a voluntary target to cut electricity use by 10% and a mandatory energy savings target of 5% during peak hours. The mandatory peak hours target was deemed necessary to avoid power being simply moved from most to least efficient countries in the EU’s shared electricity market.</p> \n<p>The 10% cut in electricity use is meant to be achieved between 1 December and the end of March. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter\">15% voluntary target</a> for cutting gas consumption over the winter was agreed in July.</p> \n<p>EU officials said if the demand-reduction plans were successful, governments would earn less than the estimated €140bn from windfall taxes, but consumers would benefit from lower bills. </p> \n<p>The emergency measures were agreed after a 37% decline in gas supplies from Russia to the EU between January and August, following the invasion of Ukraine. The risks to EU energy supply were further exposed this week when four leaks were found in two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/sweden-reports-fourth-nord-stream-1-2-pipeline-leak\">Nord Stream gas pipelines</a>, believed by EU leaders to be acts of sabotage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3949c31d-409d-4185-99af-fec531565f0c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/03ovWDvGWEM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the consensus on a windfall tax and energy savings, ministers remain divided over plans to cap the price of gas. France, Italy, Spain and Poland were among 15 countries this week urging the European Commission to table a price cap as “the one measure that will help every member state to mitigate the inflationary pressure, manage expectations and provide a framework in case of potential supply disruptions, and limit the extra profits in the sector”.</p> \n<p>The Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who chaired Friday’s meeting, called on the commission to table additional measures targeted at reducing gas prices as soon as possible. “The households and businesses need the help now. We are in the energy war with Russia and we need to act. Now means now … Now is not in a week and definitely not in a month,” he said.</p> \n<p>Germany, the Netherlands and EU officials, however, are sceptical about a price cap, fearing it could harm the EU’s ability to secure scarce supplies of liquified natural gas in a competitive global market.</p> \n<p>Critics also say the system would require an EU authority to allocate and ration gas to member states, a politically fraught task never done at EU level. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said capping the wholesale price of gas had risks. “What happens when the clearing is not happening? Who will then decide where gas goes? [Is the] European Commission to decide? … Look, I think this is a system that can be very, very difficult to administer.”</p> \n<p>The commission continues to favour capping the price of Russian gas, a measure that has the support of only the Baltic states and is unlikely to pass.</p> \n<p>Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “ready to develop a temporary EU-wide measure to limit the price of gas in electricity generation”, which she described as a far-reaching step.</p> \n<p>“A wholesale gas price cap is a legitimate option,” she told reporters, “but it requires a radical intervention in the market which means several non-negotiable conditions have to be met before this cap will work.” One of those conditions, she said, would be a gas-savings target going beyond the 15% already set. </p> \n<p>Riina Sikkut, Estonia’s infrastructure minister, rejected suggestions that Europeans faced a choice between heating and eating. “We can’t forget that we are in a situation of war,” she said. “Ukrainians are paying with their lives. So we may temporarily pay higher bills or prices in the food store.”</p>",

                    "bodyText": "EU energy ministers have agreed to levy windfall taxes on energy companies’ profits, and to cut electricity use, but remain at loggerheads over proposals to cap the price of gas. Meeting in Brussels on Friday, the bloc’s 27 energy ministers signed off on proposals to levy a “solidarity contribution” on fossil fuel producers that have benefited from soaring energy prices. Revenues of renewable energy and nuclear power companies will be capped in response to the “unexpectedly large financial gains” made in recent months, as a result of their profits being linked to the price of expensive gas and coal, according to an EU statement. The measures, which together could raise €140bn (£123bn) to help lower consumer bills and fund the switch to green energy across the EU, contrast with the British government’s approach. Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, has ruled out extending the £5bn energy tax introduced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak. Unlike the UK, the EU is also moving ahead with plans to reduce demand for energy. Ministers agreed on a voluntary target to cut electricity use by 10% and a mandatory energy savings target of 5% during peak hours. The mandatory peak hours target was deemed necessary to avoid power being simply moved from most to least efficient countries in the EU’s shared electricity market. The 10% cut in electricity use is meant to be achieved between 1 December and the end of March. A 15% voluntary target for cutting gas consumption over the winter was agreed in July. EU officials said if the demand-reduction plans were successful, governments would earn less than the estimated €140bn from windfall taxes, but consumers would benefit from lower bills. The emergency measures were agreed after a 37% decline in gas supplies from Russia to the EU between January and August, following the invasion of Ukraine. The risks to EU energy supply were further exposed this week when four leaks were found in two Nord Stream gas pipelines, believed by EU leaders to be acts of sabotage. Despite the consensus on a windfall tax and energy savings, ministers remain divided over plans to cap the price of gas. France, Italy, Spain and Poland were among 15 countries this week urging the European Commission to table a price cap as “the one measure that will help every member state to mitigate the inflationary pressure, manage expectations and provide a framework in case of potential supply disruptions, and limit the extra profits in the sector”. The Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who chaired Friday’s meeting, called on the commission to table additional measures targeted at reducing gas prices as soon as possible. “The households and businesses need the help now. We are in the energy war with Russia and we need to act. Now means now … Now is not in a week and definitely not in a month,” he said. Germany, the Netherlands and EU officials, however, are sceptical about a price cap, fearing it could harm the EU’s ability to secure scarce supplies of liquified natural gas in a competitive global market. Critics also say the system would require an EU authority to allocate and ration gas to member states, a politically fraught task never done at EU level. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said capping the wholesale price of gas had risks. “What happens when the clearing is not happening? Who will then decide where gas goes? [Is the] European Commission to decide? … Look, I think this is a system that can be very, very difficult to administer.” The commission continues to favour capping the price of Russian gas, a measure that has the support of only the Baltic states and is unlikely to pass. Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “ready to develop a temporary EU-wide measure to limit the price of gas in electricity generation”, which she described as a far-reaching step. “A wholesale gas price cap is a legitimate option,” she told reporters, “but it requires a radical intervention in the market which means several non-negotiable conditions have to be met before this cap will work.” One of those conditions, she said, would be a gas-savings target going beyond the 15% already set. Riina Sikkut, Estonia’s infrastructure minister, rejected suggestions that Europeans faced a choice between heating and eating. “We can’t forget that we are in a situation of war,” she said. “Ukrainians are paying with their lives. So we may temporarily pay higher bills or prices in the food store.”",

That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog for today.</p> \n  <p>Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>The EU foreign policy chief <strong>Josep Borrell</strong> warned Moscow that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: “Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated.”<em> </em>The<em> </em>Nato chief, <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong>, also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> faced “severe consequences” if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p>After retreating about 20km in the north of the <strong>Kherson</strong> sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of <strong>Mylove</strong>, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern <strong>Kherson</strong> region, <strong>Volodymyr Saldo</strong>, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from <strong>Kherson</strong>. The Russian deputy prime minister <strong>Marat Khusnullin</strong> said on state television: “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine</strong>’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in <strong>Mykolaiv</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’</strong><strong>s power grid has been “stabilised” </strong>after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A residential building in the southern Russian city of <strong>Belgorod</strong> near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. <strong>Mykhaylo Podolyak</strong>, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia</strong> said it had summoned diplomats from <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Denmark</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong> to complain that representatives from Moscow and <strong>Gazprom</strong> had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the <strong>Nord Stream</strong> gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> and his Turkish counterpart, <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong>, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The U</strong><strong>N</strong><strong> general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine </strong>as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russia’s foreign minister, <strong>Sergey Lavrov</strong>, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The UK defence secretary, <strong>Ben Wallace</strong>, said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war</strong>, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, <strong>Alexander Venediktov</strong>, told Russian state Tass news agency in an <a href=\"https://tass.com/politics/1521961\">interview</a> on Thursday.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-10-13T18:12:28.022Z\">at 7.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6348459c8f08c0284e6d2cb0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-10-13T17:10:51.483Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv:</em></p> \n  <p>Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline.</p> \n  <p>Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months.</p> \n  <p>“The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,” Khusnullin said.</p> \n  <p>The development followed a public request on the social media platform Telegram by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region.</p> \n  <p>Read more: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/russia-announces-kherson-evacuation-raising-fears-city-will-become-frontline\">Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/russia-announces-kherson-evacuation-raising-fears-city-will-become-frontline\">Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-10-13T17:48:29.204Z\">at 6.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-634841a98f085fc6682b2773\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-10-13T16:57:03.501Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Simon Smith is chair of the steering committee of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, and they write for us to argue that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/12/putin-nazi-terrorist-ukraine-desperation-russia\">Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation</a></strong>:</em></p> \n  <p>The Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days have opened a further deplorable chapter in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-230-of-the-invasion\">Russia’s aggression</a> against the country.</p> \n  <p>Yet we need to resist seeing it as a shocking new moment in Russia’s assault.</p> \n  <p>Each additional death brings new personal tragedy and heartbreak.

                    "bodyText": "It is coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog for today. Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed: The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: “Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated.” The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, also said Russia faced “severe consequences” if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine. After retreating about 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from Kherson. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary.” Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv: Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,” Khusnullin said. The development followed a public request on the social media platform Telegram by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region. Read more: Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline Simon Smith is chair of the steering committee of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, and they write for us to argue that Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation: The Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days have opened a further deplorable chapter in Russia’s aggression against the country. Yet we need to resist seeing it as a shocking new moment in Russia’s assault. Each additional death brings new personal tragedy and heartbreak. But, in many respects, the wrecking of civilian lives and infrastructure is not new. It’s what millions of Ukrainians have been bravely living with for months. These strikes – and those that may well follow – are more of the same: entirely in line with the vindictiveness and indifference to civilian suffering with which Ukrainians have become familiar over eight years under Russian attack. Read more here: First ‘Nazis’, now ‘terrorists’: Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, has tweeted a picture and footage of 20 newly-released prisoners of war. As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia said 20 soldiers on both sides had been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all. In a follow-up post, Yermak said that 14 of the returned soldiers were from the Ukrainian armed forces, four were from the territorial defence forces, one from the national guard and one from the navy. Russia said today it will evacuate residents from the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson after a plea from a Kremlin-backed official, AFP reports. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary. As we reported earlier Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, posted a video on Telegram urging people to leave the region due to missile attacks. He directly addressed Russian authorities and asked them to “help organise this work.” The plea is a possible sign that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is continuing to make inroads in the south of the country. It comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in Kherson. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising “repair together” weekends to help villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when the war broke out and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the regional military administration in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, said today that Russia launched six rockets in the region. He said that Ukraine’s air defence forces shot down four of them, but two of the rockets hit a target. Kozytsky did not specify what was struck by the bombardment or if there were any casualties. In a post on his Twitter and Telegram accounts, he said: Today, the enemy launched 6 rockets on the territory of Lviv region. Unfortunately, there are two hits. Four rockets were shot down by soldiers of the “Zahid” PvK. Thanks to our air defence for the highly professional work. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow today that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: Putin is saying he is not bluffing. Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the member states, and the United States and Nato are not bluffing neither. Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia faces “severe consequences” if it launches a nuclear assault on Ukraine. However the alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond as non-member Ukraine is not covered by its self-defence clause. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Ukraine and Russia say 20 soldiers on both sides have been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all, Associated Press reports. The Russian defence ministry said: As a result of the negotiation process on the exchange today, 20 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukraine also said its 20 soldiers have been freed from captivity in Olenivka, in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They are now undergoing medical checkups. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, vowed on Telegram: We will bring everyone back. Philip Oltermann reports for us in Berlin: Europe’s largest economy is still a “teenager” when it comes to foreign security policy, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s chief of staff has said, asking for patience from western allies urging Germany to take a more proactive leadership in its support of Ukraine. “We are getting into a situation that Americans have known for decades: people want us to lead,” said Wolfgang Schmidt, a longstanding ally of Scholz who also serves as the political point of contact for the country’s intelligence agencies. “We are in the teenager years in that role,” he said, responding to criticism that Berlin has been slow to live up to the Zeitenwende or “epochal turn” on military and foreign policy Scholz had declared in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read more: Germany still a ‘teenager’ on leading foreign security policy, says Scholz’s top aide These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Earlier we reported that Moscow had summoned the ambassadors from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Russia and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures on the Nord Stream gas pipelines [see 10.52am]. The Reuters news agency is now carrying a statement from the Danish foreign ministry which says “the Russian wish to participate in the investigation of the Nord Stream leaks has been brought up through diplomatic channels in Moscow and Copenhagen.” However, Sweden’s foreign ministry appears to have told the media that it has not received any summons. At the same time, the Russian president’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said, according to reports from Russian agency Interfax, that arrests have been made after an attempt to attack the TurkStream pipeline: Some forces, Putin gave hints about the possible origin of these forces, they encroached on the TurkStream as well. Saboteurs were taken, several people were arrested. They wanted to blow it up. On our territory, on land. The TurkStream pipeline runs from near Anapa in Krasnodar Krai to Kıyıköy in north-western Turkey. Interfax reports that earlier in October, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukrainian authorities were trying to undermine a section of the pipeline. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has posted images of a visit to the city by Harjit Sajjan, who is Canada’s minister for international development. Lviv was one of the cities whose electrical infrastructure was attacked by Russia earlier in the week. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people, Agence France-Presse reports. In a video posted to Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, said: We suggested to all people of the Kherson region to, if they wish, leave to other regions to protect themselves from missile hits. In addressing the leadership of the country [Russia], I ask you to help organise this work. He added: We, the people of the Kherson region, know that Russia does not abandon its own. Saldo said the region was being hit by an increasing amount of rocket attacks bringing “serious damage”, in signs that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was continuing to made progress. His warning comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in the Kherson region. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting today, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. “The topic of a Russian-Ukrainian settlement was not discussed,” RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit today in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Agence France-Presse reports that the Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement on Telegram: The Ukrainian armed forces shelled Belgorod. There is damage at a residential apartment building on Gubkin street. Information about the victims is being detailed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Gladkov added that shelling by Ukraine’s forces had landed near school grounds in a village called Krasnoye outside the main city of Belgorod, with students learning online from home. No one was reported injured or killed. Attending a Nato meeting, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said there was no risk that western allies would run out of arms supplies to aid Ukraine against Russia. “The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure that we can go on between 2023, 24, and keep going on,” Wallace said today. He added that the UK would provide Ukraine with air defence systems that would complement US-provided systems. Ukraine faced a barrage of missile strikes earlier this week, damaging civilian infrastructure and knocking out electricity supplies in some cities AFP reports that Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said today. The head of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Facebook: The introduction of scheduled emergency blackouts is currently not being planned ... This became possible, first of all, thanks to the fact that Ukrenergo and Oblenergo experts stabilised the energy supply in all regions of Ukraine. We withstood what was probably the largest missile attack on energy infrastructure in history. Whether there will be [supply] restrictions in the future depends primarily on whether there will be new shelling and destruction. Russia has blitzed Ukraine with missiles this week, in attacks that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said were retaliation for a deadly explosion at a Crimea bridge. As we previously reported, Ukrainian officials said that 40 towns and cities in the country had been targeted by Russian forces in the past 24 hours. As well as Putin’s idea for a gas hub, detailed in the post below this one, the Russian president and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also discussed nuclear power. Meeting Putin at the start of a regional summit in Kazakhstan, Erdoğan mentioned Russia’s construction of Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which Ankara hopes to open next year, AFP reports. Erdoğan raised the idea of Russia building a second nuclear power plant in northern Turkey. The Turkish president also defended Ankara’s booming trade ties with Moscow. The US and the EU are piling pressure on Turkey to comply with sanctions they imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Erdoğan has refused, offering the Nato member Turkey as a neutral venue for possible truce talks, and approving a range of agreements that have seen the value of exports to Russia more than double in recent months. Russian president Vladimir Putin floated the idea of a major gas hub in Turkey during talks with his counterpart Recep Tayip Erdoğan today. Putin told Erdoğan at a meeting in Kazakhstan: Turkey has turned out to be the most reliable route for deliveries today, even to Europe. We could consider the possibility of creating a gas hub in Turkey for supplies to other countries. The Russian president added: In the course of the work of this hub, which we could create together, of course, it would also be a platform not only for supplies, but also for determining the price, because this is a very important issue - the issue of pricing. Today, these prices are sky-high; we could easily regulate at a normal market level, without any political overtones. Putin suggested on Wednesday that Russia could create a major gas hub in Turkey by redirecting supplies intended for the damaged Nord Stream undersea pipelines, reports Reuters. Swedish and Danish authorities are investigating the blasts as acts of sabotage but have not yet said who they believe was responsible. In the televised exchange between the two leaders, Erdoğan did not comment on the gas hub idea. This graphic shows the location of the Russian missiles that struck 40 Ukrainian towns and cities today, according to officials. Ukraine‘s Armed Forces General Staff said that in the past 24 hours more than 40 settlements were hit by Russian shelling. In response Ukraine‘s air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets. The mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said in a social media post that the southern city was “massively shelled”, reports Reuters. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising ‘Repair Together’ weekends to help poor villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when war broke out, and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Estonia has confirmed a new military aid package for Ukraine that will include winter gear, equipment and ammunition. Prime minister Kaja Kallas confirmed the additional support in a tweet today. Kallas added: Let us all speed up our help, so Ukrainians can free their territories. This is the way to peace. Estonia, who share a border with Russia, have already provided Kyiv with more than €220 million (£192,479,486) in military assistance and have called for richer Western nations to increase weapons supplies to the country. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have started talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. The duo are in the country for the the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the regional summit, and the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov previously suggested the Erdoğan could propose ideas for peace. Philip Oltermann reports for us from Berlin: The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has accused Vladimir Putin of waging “a crusade against our way of life”, in a shift of rhetoric days after heavy Russian missile strikes hit major Ukrainian cities. “They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade,” Scholz said in a video address to a summit of European socialist, liberal and green politicians and thinkers in Berlin. “A crusade against liberal democracy, a crusade against the rules-based international order, a crusade against freedom and progress, a crusade against our way of life,” he added. Read more: Putin’s war on Ukraine part of crusade against liberal democracy, says Scholz Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a statement on Thursday, it said: “Rockets hit a five-storey residential building. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble.” A 12-year-old boy has been rescued from the site but there are thought to be at least seven others trapped. After retreating around 20km to the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence.

The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Tass, the Russian state news agency, in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Thursday the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Joe Middleton will be here shortly. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” Reuters reports the foreign ministry said. European nations have suggested the only possible cause of the ruptures to the pipelines was sabotage, with only a limited number of state actors suspected of being capable of such an operation. Two quotes this morning underscore the diplomatic gulf between the rhetoric of western leaders and Russia. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has this morning said the war in Ukraine is part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. Reuters quotes him saying: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” Meanwhile, Tass news agency is reporting the words of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. He has told Russian television that the west used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries so an anti-Russian resolution on “referendums” in the occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions was adopted at the session of the UN general assembly. Tass report Lavrov also said that US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote were false. Here is the clip of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, explaining that procurement processes are in place among allies in the west that he says will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest situation map of how it sees developments on the ground in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has only 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. The president was speaking in a question and answer session with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Reuters has reported. Zelenskiy also said diplomacy was not possible with leaders who did not respect international law. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, has posted to Telegram to report that the city of Orikhiv has been targeted, killing one person. He writes: The city of Orikhiv is once again the target of the enemy. The occupier destroyed residential buildings along the central street and in a residential neighbourhood with a massive, multi-hour shelling of a small, peaceful town. The enemy took the life of a resident of the village. In addition, we have 9 wounded from Orikhov and 1 from Preobrazhenka, 3 more in Stepnohirsk. Other objects of civil infrastructure and utility networks, homes in which people invested their whole lives were destroyed. We will rebuild everything as soon as we knock out the enemy from our land, but the main thing is to save human life. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not being fully in control of the territory. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said there “isn’t a risk” of the western supply of arms to Ukraine running out before Russia’s supplies are exhausted. He told Deborah Haynes, the defence and security correspondent of Sky News: There isn’t a risk because unlike Russia, who has already isolated itself and we saw that yesterday at the United Nations vote, they need a supply chain. Large parts of the supply chain were not in Russia. They came from all over the world, including in Europe, including indeed even in Ukraine, some of their supply chain was in Ukraine. We have the ability to refurbish or indeed manufacture a new supply chain which is what we are doing right now. The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure we can go on in 2023, 2024 and keep going on. The state emergency service of Ukraine has issued this image of the target of a strike in Mykolaiv. In the UK, the foreign secretary James Cleverly has been doing the morning media round. So far his interviews have entirely been dominated by domestic issues. However, on Sky News he did mention the vote in the UN, telling viewers that domestic problems were being “amplified by Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.” He went on to say: We need to help Ukrainians defend their country. We saw in the vote in the United Nations last night, we’ve got an international coalition of condemnation against Russia in support of Ukraine. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. It quotes Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, saying: “The process of switching to the Russian system has already been launched.” He added: “This implies a number of points, starting with documents, regulations and so on. It is clear that there will be a transitional period for each component. “While we are immersing ourselves in the process, we are simultaneously analysing all the processes and developing specific solutions, including those related to the storage of all nuclear materials.” Yesterday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described the situation at the ZNPP as “deeply worrying” after the plant again lost external power due to Russian military action cutting supplies. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the plant, also accused the Russian forces occupying it of blocking attempts to refuel the site’s diesel generators. The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said that “the day in our region passed without worries” in his latest update. He stated that 301 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine, and that 547 travelled from Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on evacuation trains. Rodion Miroshnik, the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), has criticised the vote at the UN, saying developing nations had been forced to vote “at the point of an American gun”. He posted to Telegram: Yesterday’s vote at the special session of the UN General Assembly is a demonstration of the US’s ability to put pressure on and twist the arms of developing countries. The “scoreboard” only demonstrates who is not yet ready to resist American blackmail, and who they have not found leverage against. It has nothing to do with the true will of states and their peoples. But even with such a vote “at the point of an American gun,” countries with a population of half the world either voted against or abstained from voting for the American-Albanian resolution condemning Russia’s actions to recognise referendums in the LPR, Donetsk People’s Republic, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The Russian Federation has announced that the occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk is to be annexed, after staging widely-derided “referendums” in four regions. The LPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a message on Telegram, the service said: One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. As of 8am, rescuers unblocked a twelve-year-old boy from under the rubble, who was handed over to doctors. According to preliminary information, there may be seven residents of the five-story building under the ruins of the building, with whom there is currently no communication. Rescuers are searching for them and analysing the destroyed structures. To provide assistance to the local population, volunteers of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine are working on the spot, emergency medical teams, law enforcement officers and emergency teams of the city are involved. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told the Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Tass cited Venediktov as saying: Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three. Apparently, that’s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again.” Venediktov also repeated a Russian position that the west, by helping Ukraine, indicated that “they are a direct party to the conflict”. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. “In recent days, the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson,” the report adds. “It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself.” Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. An explosion on Saturday partially destroyed the strategic key bridge, built specifically on Putin’s orders and linking Crimea to Russia. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack. Dozens of Ukraine’s allies have pledged to send more military aid to Ukraine after more than 50 western countries met In Brussels on Wednesday. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of the sophisticated national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. “Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” The UK has said it will donate cutting edge air defence weaponry, capable of shooting down cruise missiles It did not say how many of the Amraam rockets would be sent to Ukraine, but said they would be used with Nasams. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said: “Russia’s latest indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support to those seeking to defend their nation. So today I have authorised the supply of Amraam anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defence alongside the US Nasams.” France has also promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament that her government would be donating €15m (£13m) worth of air defences to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said the vote sent a “clear message” to Moscow. “The stakes of this conflict are clear to all, and the world has sent a clear message in response – Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “grateful to 143 states that supported the historic UNGA [United Nations general assembly] resolution”, tweeting: “The world had its say – [Russia’s] attempt at annexation is worthless and will never be recognised by free nations.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the vote showed international unity against Russia and repeated that Washington would never recognise the “sham” referendums. The vote “is a powerful reminder that the overwhelming majority of nations stand with Ukraine, in defence of the UN Charter and in resolute opposition to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and its people,” he said in a statement. Before the vote, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said: “Today it is Russia invading Ukraine. But tomorrow it could be another nation whose territory is violated. It could be you. You could be next. What would you expect from this chamber?” The United Nations general assembly has overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions, demanding that Moscow reverse course. Three-quarters of the 193-member general assembly – or 143 countries – voted on Wednesday in favour of a resolution that called Moscow’s move illegal, deepening Russia’s international isolation. Only four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution – Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus. Thirty-five countries abstained, including Russia’s strategic partner China, together with India, South Africa and Pakistan. The rest did not vote. The resolution adopted on Wednesday declares that Moscow’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, are “inconsistent” with the principles of the UN charter, and “have no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine.” It demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.” It also supports “the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means” that respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internationally recognised borders. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdogan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us.” As we await more details on the reported drone strike on Kyiv region this morning, the southern city of Mykolaiv has also reported being hit by a barrage of missiles overnight. “A five-storey residential building was hit, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. Rescuers are working on the site,” mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said in a Telegram post just before 4am local time, adding the southern city was “massively shelled”. After the first night, Mykolaiv was massively shelled. A five-story residential building was hit. The two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble. Rescuers are working on the spot.” Russian forces have reportedly struck the Kyiv region with kamikaze drones, according to local officials and media reports. Kyiv regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, issued an update via his official Telegram channel just after 6am local time, saying: We have attacks on one of the communities of the region. Previously - an attack of kamikaze drones. Rescuers are already working.” Kuleba urged residents to stay in shelters. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of president Zelenskiy’s office, also reported that critical infrastructure facilities were hit by drone strikes in the region. Another attack by kamikaze drones on critical infrastructure facilities.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. We are also receiving reports that the Kyiv region has been hit by drone strikes early this morning with Zelenskiy’s office reporting critical infrastructure facilities being struck. Here’s a rundown of all the latest major developments over the past 24 hours. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Putin will meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan on Thursday, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians are being reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months.",

                    "body": "<p>Centrica and EDF, the duo behind the UK’s current fleet of nuclear power stations, have read the political breezes, sensed the popular mood and come to the correct conclusion: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/british-gas-cap-profits-cut-energy-bills-centrica-electricity\">they’re up for a negotiation with government to cap the price of electricity</a>.</p> <p>So they should be, of course. Even if the size of windfall profits being collected by generators is currently unclear, nobody doubts the fact of outsized returns when current forward-selling contracts fall away. The wholesale price of electricity, absurdly, is tied to the price of gas, creating nonsensical outcomes in those corners of the generation market where input prices are virtually unchanged.</p> <p>One could, perhaps, be slightly nervous that Centrica and EDF have volunteered for duty so speedily. The companies aren’t charities and they’ll be looking for something for themselves – namely medium or long-term guarantees on prices. That worry, though, is really an argument for transparency when the deal-making begins. At this stage, willingness to come to the table is what matters. It’s up to ministers, if they’re really dead-set against new windfall taxes, to thrash out decent terms to protect the public purse.</p> <p>So where are the other corporate volunteers? Drax, as a biomass-based business, tends to be overlooked in the focus on nuclear, wind and solar generators, but it is in exactly the same lucky economic boat. Burning wood pellets to generate power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits\">is a lucrative business</a> if you’re being paid as if you’re a gas generator. Witness the jump in Drax’s profits, and two-thirds improvement in the share price, since wholesale energy started to climb last autumn.</p> <p>Since Drax is also the beneficiary of stupendous support under current arrangements (thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, the company will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies), it ought to have been the first company to say it will come to the table. Will Drax play ball? Aside from a few boiler-plate words about working in partnership with government, Drax on Monday was gloriously unclear about its readiness to negotiate. Not good enough. Get with the programme.</p> <h2>Reasons to admire outgoing Serco CEO’s corporate rescue job</h2> <p>Serco is one of those companies that is doomed never to enjoy popular acclaim and affection – or even, in some quarters, acceptance. That’s life. Nor is suspicion remotely surprising given that the outsourcing firm only emerged a few months ago from a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/serco-fined-229m-over-electronic-tagging-scandal\"> three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office</a> related to past shenanigans with electronic tagging contracts for prisoners.</p> <p>There are, though, two strong reasons to admire the corporate rescue job performed by chief executive Rupert Soames, who on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/12/serco-chief-to-retire-rupert-soames-outsourcing\">announced his looming retirement</a> (“outsourcing myself”, as he put it). The first is that Serco still exists.</p> <p>Back in 2014, survival wasn’t guaranteed. Aside from the scandal with tags, Soames inherited a £1.5bn annual loss and a chunk of contracts that made no commercial sense for the provider. The company was an operational and balance-sheet mess. Soames served up a £150m rights issue as an amuse bouche on day one, and made investors swallow a £550m thumper the following year. Both fundraisers were essentially acts of faith on the part of investors.</p> <p>Turnaround wasn’t quick, but the new strategic direction has been vindicated. Today’s Serco is a government-only contractor with a greater international spread (particularly in North America) and a bias towards defence. Progress from the 100p rights issue price to today’s 168p has been steady, rather than spectacular, but that is roughly what low-margin contractors should deliver: a touch of reliability. Investors have been much better off by owning Serco in the period than outsourcing twin Capita (let alone its cousin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/carillion-collapse-two-years-on-government-has-learned-nothing\">the late and unlamented Carillion</a>).</p> <p>Soames, 63, will be replaced by Mark Irwin, who seems to have been earmarked for succession for a while. One hopes the new man has digested the second lesson of the Soames era: speak plainly, acknowledge that outsourcing is controversial and be prepared to debate your critics.</p> <p>A few non-believers will never accept that public services should be delivered by private companies. The rest of us know that it is often a better way to deliver value for money – but we do still want maximum transparency from the providers.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Centrica and EDF, the duo behind the UK’s current fleet of nuclear power stations, have read the political breezes, sensed the popular mood and come to the correct conclusion: they’re up for a negotiation with government to cap the price of electricity. So they should be, of course. Even if the size of windfall profits being collected by generators is currently unclear, nobody doubts the fact of outsized returns when current forward-selling contracts fall away. The wholesale price of electricity, absurdly, is tied to the price of gas, creating nonsensical outcomes in those corners of the generation market where input prices are virtually unchanged. One could, perhaps, be slightly nervous that Centrica and EDF have volunteered for duty so speedily. The companies aren’t charities and they’ll be looking for something for themselves – namely medium or long-term guarantees on prices. That worry, though, is really an argument for transparency when the deal-making begins. At this stage, willingness to come to the table is what matters. It’s up to ministers, if they’re really dead-set against new windfall taxes, to thrash out decent terms to protect the public purse. So where are the other corporate volunteers? Drax, as a biomass-based business, tends to be overlooked in the focus on nuclear, wind and solar generators, but it is in exactly the same lucky economic boat. Burning wood pellets to generate power is a lucrative business if you’re being paid as if you’re a gas generator. Witness the jump in Drax’s profits, and two-thirds improvement in the share price, since wholesale energy started to climb last autumn. Since Drax is also the beneficiary of stupendous support under current arrangements (thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, the company will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies), it ought to have been the first company to say it will come to the table. Will Drax play ball? Aside from a few boiler-plate words about working in partnership with government, Drax on Monday was gloriously unclear about its readiness to negotiate. Not good enough. Get with the programme. Reasons to admire outgoing Serco CEO’s corporate rescue job Serco is one of those companies that is doomed never to enjoy popular acclaim and affection – or even, in some quarters, acceptance. That’s life. Nor is suspicion remotely surprising given that the outsourcing firm only emerged a few months ago from a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office related to past shenanigans with electronic tagging contracts for prisoners. There are, though, two strong reasons to admire the corporate rescue job performed by chief executive Rupert Soames, who on Monday announced his looming retirement (“outsourcing myself”, as he put it). The first is that Serco still exists. Back in 2014, survival wasn’t guaranteed. Aside from the scandal with tags, Soames inherited a £1.5bn annual loss and a chunk of contracts that made no commercial sense for the provider. The company was an operational and balance-sheet mess. Soames served up a £150m rights issue as an amuse bouche on day one, and made investors swallow a £550m thumper the following year. Both fundraisers were essentially acts of faith on the part of investors. Turnaround wasn’t quick, but the new strategic direction has been vindicated. Today’s Serco is a government-only contractor with a greater international spread (particularly in North America) and a bias towards defence. Progress from the 100p rights issue price to today’s 168p has been steady, rather than spectacular, but that is roughly what low-margin contractors should deliver: a touch of reliability. Investors have been much better off by owning Serco in the period than outsourcing twin Capita (let alone its cousin, the late and unlamented Carillion). Soames, 63, will be replaced by Mark Irwin, who seems to have been earmarked for succession for a while. One hopes the new man has digested the second lesson of the Soames era: speak plainly, acknowledge that outsourcing is controversial and be prepared to debate your critics. A few non-believers will never accept that public services should be delivered by private companies. The rest of us know that it is often a better way to deliver value for money – but we do still want maximum transparency from the providers.",

This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/01/full-steam-ahead-for-cornwalls-geothermal-energy-project\">United Downs project</a> aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate.</p> <p>The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023:</p> <h2>Renewed impetus for renewables</h2> <p>The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances.</p> <p>Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/28/no-10-set-to-allow-new-onshore-wind-projects-in-england-in-u-turn\">lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England</a>. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/scottishandsouthernenergy\">SSE</a> Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/23/throwing-the-switch-on-scotlands-largest-offshore-windfarm\">expected to be fully operational by the summer</a>. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available.</p> <p>It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link\">hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government</a> – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project.</p> <h2>Nuclear vision</h2> <p>The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/29/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-confirmed-edf-suffolk-jobs-uk\">the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear</a>. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan\">Centrica commit to investment</a>?

                    "bodyText": "A tall white rig punctures the Cornish skyline, offering a hint of a new industrial era at a site near Redruth, once a copper mining capital. This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023.

To be, at 19 years of age, the most recognised climate crisis campaigner in the world, shouldering the burden of averting – or at this late stage, merely softening – the biggest calamity humanity has ever faced? What can that possibly feel like?</p> <p>At the end of Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg (BBC Two), the conversation becomes more personal and we get a few answers: how Thunberg doesn’t enjoy being stopped in the street and certainly doesn’t appreciate threats to her family; how she despairs at being told her presence reassures people about the future of the planet, because it implies they are outsourcing their individual responsibility to her.</p> <p>But a fundamental insight into Thunberg’s existence has already been provided by the previous half-hour of questions about her advocacy of “annual, drastic, immediate emissions cuts, on a scale unlike anything the world has ever seen”. Thunberg has sacrificed her youth to tackle the climate emergency, having realised that it demands a radical reimagining of our whole way of life. Now she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people who cannot conceive of that way of life changing.</p> <p>Rajan, who asserts in his introduction that Thunberg’s influence must be acknowledged “whether you admire her or despair of her”, spends large parts of the interview reflecting mainstream discourse on climate – which is to say, he risks sounding ignorant in order to give commonplace gotchas and canards an airing. The sport is in how efficiently Thunberg can knock down questions we should, by now, have moved beyond asking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her concern is about driving awareness: arguments about which bucket of water to use will dissipate once people agree that the house is on fire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Early on, she is pressed for an opinion on nuclear power and shale gas. Aren’t they important components of a strategy to hit net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement?

                    "bodyText": "What must it be like to be Greta Thunberg? To be, at 19 years of age, the most recognised climate crisis campaigner in the world, shouldering the burden of averting – or at this late stage, merely softening – the biggest calamity humanity has ever faced? What can that possibly feel like? At the end of Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg (BBC Two), the conversation becomes more personal and we get a few answers: how Thunberg doesn’t enjoy being stopped in the street and certainly doesn’t appreciate threats to her family; how she despairs at being told her presence reassures people about the future of the planet, because it implies they are outsourcing their individual responsibility to her. But a fundamental insight into Thunberg’s existence has already been provided by the previous half-hour of questions about her advocacy of “annual, drastic, immediate emissions cuts, on a scale unlike anything the world has ever seen”. Thunberg has sacrificed her youth to tackle the climate emergency, having realised that it demands a radical reimagining of our whole way of life. Now she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people who cannot conceive of that way of life changing. Rajan, who asserts in his introduction that Thunberg’s influence must be acknowledged “whether you admire her or despair of her”, spends large parts of the interview reflecting mainstream discourse on climate – which is to say, he risks sounding ignorant in order to give commonplace gotchas and canards an airing. The sport is in how efficiently Thunberg can knock down questions we should, by now, have moved beyond asking. Early on, she is pressed for an opinion on nuclear power and shale gas. Aren’t they important components of a strategy to hit net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement? Thunberg does say that the former is too slow and the latter is, er, a fossil fuel and thus not a cracking idea, but stresses that her concern is driving awareness of the extent of the problem, not getting bogged down in hot-button issues: arguments about which bucket of water to use will dissipate once people agree that the house is on fire. Unskewing our priorities is also the rejoinder to Rajan’s question, steeped in conservative attitudes towards which expenditures are inevitable and which must be interrogated, about how we would “pay for” free public transport, a key Thunberg objective, during a “cost of living crisis”. Thunberg is presented with several versions of the same argument: we can’t do that, because it would cost money or be inconvenient in the short term. At a time when both main UK political parties have recently used the slogan “growth, growth, growth”, Thunberg’s contention that the endless pursuit of economic expansion might just be, you know, suicidal feels like listening to an intelligent alien who is beamed down to sort us out.

Flying is one of those … do you think flying should be illegal?” More credibly, Rajan asks how Thunberg can call capitalism a failed ideology, when life expectancy and infant survival rates in China and India have risen as those countries have commercialised. Delicately, Thunberg observes that the collapse of life-support systems, wars for resources and other likely effects of out-of-control global warming might soon cause those graphs to slope back down. It’s not all such a struggle.

                    "body": "<p>When the iron curtain was swept away on that miraculous night of 9 November 1989, it exposed some of the deepest differences between geographical neighbours the world has ever recorded. The 13:1 GDP <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2021&amp;locations=PL-DE&amp;start=1989\">per capita gap</a> between Poland and soon-to-be united Germany <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2021&amp;locations=MX-US&amp;start=1989\">was twice that</a> between the US and Mexico.</p> <p>That same night, my pregnant mother and her brothers were workers in the shadow economy on an eco-farm near Frankfurt, helping to meet the needs of a newly minted class of environmentally aware Germans. My family admired that country where “you never got lost on a highway”. People in Germany drove immaculately clean cars and manual labourers could play Stille Nacht on several instruments – which they did at the farm for Christmas 1989 – leading my mother to marvel at an education system that could so universally equip people not just with marketable skills but also with an ingrained sense of beauty.</p> <p>Neighbouring countries tend to have comparable levels of development. A common security context, investment spillovers, migration, remittances and regional supply chains create geographical pockets of welfare or poverty that transcend borders on the map.<strong> </strong>It takes a solid physical barrier – the Himalayas between China and Nepal for instance, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone\">barbed wire </a>that runs along the Korean border, or the Berlin Wall – to maintain economic chasms such as those that existed between the Poland and Germany of my mother’s era.</p> <p>But eastern Europe’s economic prospects were rapidly revived by the economic integration that took off in Europe in the 1990s. Reunified Germany wanted to have something akin to “the west” in its immediate eastern neighbourhood even if this required a degree of political heavy-lifting elsewhere in the EU. France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe.</p> <p>Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, <a href=\"https://w3.unece.org/SDG/en/Indicator?id=30\">wages in Poland</a> slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany <a href=\"https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/Just%20transition%2008.pdf\">paid workers €3,122</a> a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work.</p> <p>“We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6k0cILDwE\">told me a quarter of a century later </a>– when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory\">semi-dependency</a>. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.empik.com/deutsch-deine-chance-2-cd-beza-stanislaw,prod11880156,ksiazka-p\">textbook</a> Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance).</p> <p>Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update. </p> <p>For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me.</p> <p>Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received <a href=\"https://books.google.pl/books?id=7ybMDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">2.7%</a><strong> </strong>of GDP<strong> </strong>as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary.</p> <p>From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles <a href=\"https://bi.im-g.pl/im/7/19100/m19100197,KALECKIEGO.pdf\">intimately aligned</a>, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/exports-by-country\">28% of Poland’s exports</a> go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland.</p> <p>My private misgivings about our treatment<strong> </strong>didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d1907f194229a5b7f86dae391a433b98508a6cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d1907f194229a5b7f86dae391a433b98508a6cc/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People waiting for the subway in Warsaw, Poland, January 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People waiting for the subway in Warsaw, Poland, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the <a href=\"https://books.google.pl/books?id=4SJLDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Europe%27s+Growth+Champion&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Europe's%20Growth%20Champion&amp;f=false\">longest in European history</a>. Its GDP has increased <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=PL&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false\">tenfold nominally</a>, <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=PL&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false\">sixfold when corrected</a> for the cost of living. It has a record low <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS?locations=PL\">unemployment</a> rate of 3%, <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN?end=2021&amp;locations=PL-CA&amp;start=1991\">lower infant mortality</a> than Canada, higher <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN?locations=PL-US\">female life expectancy</a> than the US and <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?locations=GB-PL\">less violent crime</a> than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either.</p> <p>The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves?</p> <p>This question was a real-world illustration of what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism,_Socialism_and_Democracy\">theorists such as Joseph Schumpeter</a> said happens in globalised capitalism when technological progress overtakes and destroys established industrial monopolies (such as those of western Europe) turning them into the dinosaurs and giving newcomers (such as eastern Europe) a chance to sneak in.</p> <p>In 2004, joining the EU meant higher standards of living, unprecedented economic growth and life chances. For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany.</p> <p>The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/east-west-tensions-reignite-as-poland-fights-labour-rules-for-truckers/\">common EU rules for truck drivers</a> which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable.</p> <p>The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/germany-backlash-reluctance-tanks-ukraine-leopard\">Germany failed</a> to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either? </p> <p>Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish <a href=\"https://defence24.com/industry/usa-to-procure-10-thousand-manpads-opportunity-for-the-polish-defence-industry\">Manpad</a> missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced <a href=\"https://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/wat/en/articles/muts-news/piast-nanosatellites-polish-army/\">nanosatellites</a> newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally.</p> <p>No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a <a href=\"https://emerging-europe.com/news/a-polish-mega-port-project-is-worrying-german-environmentalists/\">container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie </a>– an obvious competitive threat to German ports.</p> <p>Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.</p> <ul> <li><p>Anna Gromada is a social scientist and co-founder of the Warsaw-based <a href=\"https://kalecki.org/en/\">Kalecki Foundation</a></p></li> </ul>",

France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe. Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, wages in Poland slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany paid workers €3,122 a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work. “We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, told me a quarter of a century later – when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on semi-dependency. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks. In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named textbook Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance). Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update. For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me. Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received 2.7% of GDP as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary. From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles intimately aligned, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully 28% of Poland’s exports go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland. My private misgivings about our treatment didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious. Like my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the longest in European history. Its GDP has increased tenfold nominally, sixfold when corrected for the cost of living. It has a record low unemployment rate of 3%, lower infant mortality than Canada, higher female life expectancy than the US and less violent crime than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either. The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves? This question was a real-world illustration of what theorists such as Joseph Schumpeter said happens in globalised capitalism when technological progress overtakes and destroys established industrial monopolies (such as those of western Europe) turning them into the dinosaurs and giving newcomers (such as eastern Europe) a chance to sneak in. In 2004, joining the EU meant higher standards of living, unprecedented economic growth and life chances. For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany. The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for common EU rules for truck drivers which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable. The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that Germany failed to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either? Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish Manpad missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced nanosatellites newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally. No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie – an obvious competitive threat to German ports. Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu. Anna Gromada is a social scientist and co-founder of the Warsaw-based Kalecki Foundation",

The move will tighten security on British ferries, which are unguarded and seen as vulnerable, with passengers not individually searched or given body scans when boarding, unlike those on planes or Eurostar trains. A government spokesperson said: “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens. “We are constantly developing protection for UK citizens against the threat of terrorism. This includes strengthening security by fully equipping law enforcement and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents, no matter where they occur.” It is understood about 40 CNC officers will be posted on a rotation basis on ferries with a trial starting in July.

A senior counter-terrorism source told the Times that ferries were seen as extremely vulnerable and “completely unguarded”. “Ferries are the weak link when it comes to policing transport against terror attacks. Moving a handful of CNC officers to ferries makes sense and they will be a visible deterrent,” the source said.

                    "body": "<p>The scientist James Lovelock’s discoveries had an immense influence on our understanding of the global impact of humankind, and on the search for extraterrestrial life. A vigorous writer and speaker, he became a hero to the green movement, although he was one of its most formidable critics.</p> <p>His research highlighted some of the issues that became the most intense environmental concerns of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, among them the insidious spread through the living world of industrial pollutants; the destruction of the ozone layer; and the potential menace of global heating. He supported nuclear power and defended the chemical industries – and his warnings took an increasingly apocalyptic note.</p> <p>“The planet we live on has merely to shrug to take some fraction of a million people to their deaths,” Lovelock wrote in 2006. “But this is nothing compared with what may soon happen; we are now so abusing the Earth that it may rise and move back into the hot state it was in 55m years ago, and if it does, most of us, and our descendants, will die.” In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/29/climatechange.sciencenews\" title=\"\">speech</a> to the Royal Society, he described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/02/greenpolitics.climatechange\" title=\"\">2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> as “the scariest official document I have ever read”.</p> <p>Lovelock, who has died on his 103rd birthday, was best known through the Gaia theory, a controversial idea that he proposed in the 1960s and developed with the US biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/11/lynn-margulis-obtiuary\" title=\"\">Lynn Margulis</a> in the 70s. They suggested a radically different way of looking at the evolution of life. Their proposition challenged the view of Earth as just a lump of rock, a passive host to millions of species of plants and animals that simply adapted to their environment. Gaia held that those countless millions of organisms not only competed, but also cooperated to maintain an environment in which life could be sustained: a process of co-evolution.</p> <p>It was a conjecture that jarred with many scholars, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a>, the evolutionary biologist, who regarded the notion as a profound heresy against Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection anchored in the thesis of survival of the fittest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\" title=\"\">Gaia</a> was an instant inspiration for the green movement; but it took years to get overt recognition from the scientific establishment. That came in 1988 when the American Geophysical Union held a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-13/local/me-1699_1_planet-earth\" title=\"\">meeting</a> in San Diego, California, that drew leading physicists, biologists and climatologists to weigh the evidence for Gaia and debate its implications for the future of science.</p> <p>In 2001, more than 1,000 scientists met in Amsterdam to declare that the planet “behaves as a single self-regulating system comprised of physical, chemical, biological and human components”. In effect, Lovelock and Margulis had won the day: the details could be debated, but the broad argument was settled.</p> <p>Early in his career, Lovelock devised techniques to freeze and then re-animate cell tissue, and even whole animals such as hamsters. Just for fun, in 1954, he used microwave radiation from a continuous wave magnetron to cook a potato. “It may have been the first working microwave oven used to cook food that was then eaten,” he wrote. “If it was, then I did invent it.”</p> <p>He worked with the actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/24/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Leo McKern</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/03/obituaries/joan-greenwood-65-actress.html\" title=\"\">Joan Greenwood</a> on a BBC drama, The Critical Point (1957), about the experimental freezing of a human, and used a home-made electronic sound generator to simulate the failing breath, the fading heartbeat and the death rattle of an actor. He was later told that his tape inspired the BBC to found its pioneering radiophonic workshop.</p> <p>He designed new types of extraordinarily sensitive instruments that could detect the presence of unimaginably tiny concentrations of man-made chemicals in gases. When they were used to study the chemistry of the atmosphere they pointed the finger at the spread of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the source of destruction of the ozone layer. Similarly, they revealed the accumulation of residues of pesticides in the tissues of virtually all living creatures, from penguins in Antarctica to mothers’ milk in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Throughout his life he went on delivering inventive ideas. With Chris Rapley, then director of the Science Museum in London, Lovelock <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7014503.stm\" title=\"\">proposed</a> in the journal Nature in 2007 a way by which humans could churn the world’s oceans to stimulate algal growth, draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds and thus damp down global heating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/letters-james-lovelock-obituary\">Letters: James Lovelock obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lovelock was born in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, but was brought up in Brixton, south London, where his parents, Tom and Nellie, ran a shop selling picture frames.

Lovelock was disappointed in the shift in the focus of research in biology from the big picture to the small.

He said the conclusion he reached was probably the moment Gaia was born.</p> <p>The atmospheres of both Mars and Venus comprised over 95% carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases. In contrast, the Earth’s atmosphere was 77% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with traces of carbon dioxide and other gases. He looked for an explanation as to what made the Earth’s atmosphere so different, and unique in our solar system. The evidence that the sun’s energy had increased 30% during the three and a half billion years life had existed on the planet, and yet the Earth’s surface temperature had remained constant, particularly puzzled him.</p> <p>Lovelock reckoned that, according to standard physics, the planet’s surface should have boiled with the increasing heat, rather than remain cool. The only explanation, he decided, was that the Earth was a self-regulating system that had found a way to preserve its equilibrium: and that the organisms on Earth had kept their environment stable. He reasoned that the Earth’s atmosphere was a continually changing balance of gases because of its living and breathing inhabitants, while the Martian atmosphere was static.</p> <p>The regulatory mechanism began when the earliest life-forms in the ancient oceans extracted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and released oxygen back into it. Over vast spans of geological time, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere declined to the present composition to favour the oxygen-dependent organisms. Lovelock and Margulis argued that the biosphere of planet Earth could be considered a self-evolving and self-regulating system that unconsciously and subtly manipulated atmosphere, water and rocks to its own advantage.</p> <p>When he was developing his theory, Lovelock described his ideas to his then friend and neighbour in the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke, the novelist <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-sir-william-golding-1493005.html?cmp=ilc-n\" title=\"\">William Golding</a>, and asked his advice on a suitable name.

Daisyworld involved a field of black and white daisies. If the temperature rose, the black flowers absorbed more heat than the white ones, and withered. The white daisies proliferated. Eventually, the white daisies reflected more heat back into space, cooling the planet down again and allowed the black daisies to re-emerge.</p> <p>Although Gaia exerted a great influence on the green movement, Lovelock had, by his own admission, “never been wholly on the side of environmentalism”. He acted as a consultant to corporate groups such as Hewlett-Packard and Shell, and in Homage to Gaia wrote: “Too many greens are not just ignorant of science, they hate science.” He likened them to “some global over-anxious mother figure who is so concerned about small risks that she ignores the real dangers”. He wished they “would grow up” and focus on the real problem: “How can we feed, house and clothe the abundant human race without destroying the habitats of other creatures?”</p> <p>Unlike most environmentalists, Lovelock favoured nuclear energy. “Some time in the next century, when the adverse effects of climate change begin to bite, people will look back in anger at those who now so foolishly continue to pollute by burning fossil fuel instead of accepting the beneficence of nuclear power.

Throughout his life he went on delivering inventive ideas. With Chris Rapley, then director of the Science Museum in London, Lovelock proposed in the journal Nature in 2007 a way by which humans could churn the world’s oceans to stimulate algal growth, draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds and thus damp down global heating.

Although in some respects the step is largely symbolic because the world’s nuclear powers have not signed up, the treaty will be legally binding on the smaller nations that have endorsed it, and it is backed by the UN leadership. The treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW) outlaws the creation, ownership and deployment of nuclear weapons by signatory states and places obligations on them to assist other victims of nuclear weapons use and testing. Britain’s Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has released polling saying that 59% of the UK public support the country signing up to the TPNW and that 77% support a “total ban on all nuclear weapons globally”.

Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, called on the government to do more to unlock the resources of the private sector by publishing new guidance on heating and transport. “Tackling the planet’s climate crisis before it’s too late has always been a seismic challenge demanding global cooperation on an unprecedented scale,” he will say in a speech at the CBI’s Road to Zero conference on Monday. “The world has no room for failure.

Danker called for the government to put forward detailed plans on a charging network for electric vehicles, the phasing out of gas boilers, new offshore windfarms, and funding formulas for new nuclear power stations. Last year, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced a much-heralded “10-point plan” for a green industrial revolution, but few of the aspirations it contained came with any concrete policies attached.

The president’s comments come after news organisations cited unidentified officials saying Ukrainian forces were responsible for blasts that destroyed a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, despite Kyiv declining to say whether it was behind the explosions.

                    "bodyText": "Britain’s strategic heavy industries have warned they risk being left high and dry by a lack of support in the government’s upcoming energy strategy, warning that failure to follow European countries’ measures to reduce gas and electricity costs will put UK businesses at risk. The government is expected to outline long-awaited proposals this week for a once-in-a-generation drive to invest in nuclear power and possibly more onshore wind and solar power, as well as approving continued North Sea oil and gas exploration. The plan expected to be set out by ministers on Thursday has been delayed amid disagreements in the cabinet about which technologies to back, including a fraught battle over new nuclear power plants, with the Treasury thought to be reluctant to invest large sums in costly projects. One industry source said heavy energy users were “not expecting anything” to help them on gas or electricity, the latter of which can cost up to 60% more than the price paid by European competitors. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson promised measures to “address the needs of British steel, British ceramics and the whole of British industry” but the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs last week that the government had already taken steps to support industrial firms facing soaring costs. Against a backdrop of ballooning energy bills for strategically important companies and major manufacturing firms, energy intensive industries told the Guardian that the mixed messages had left them fearing they will receive minimal help, or none at all. Richard Warren, a spokesperson for the trade body UK Steel, said it had “long urged the government to reduce the politically and regulatory controlled elements of electricity bills in line with action taken by governments elsewhere”. Simply renewing a compensation scheme that gives electricity intensive industries a refund on the cost of the UK’s emissions trading scheme, but which expired on Friday, would be only a “partial solution”. UK Steel said the industry “needs full compensation for the costs of carbon in electricity, an increase in the relief on renewables levies, and similar reductions in network costs as already provided by governments in France, Germany, and the Netherlands”. Stephen Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, warned that prolonged high energy costs could see factories reduce operations or foreign-owned firms take their business elsewhere. “I can’t stand in front of Kwasi Kwarteng and say that businesses will be shutting a week on Thursday, but I can’t say they’ll be viable and running full tilt, either,” he said. “Things are getting tighter as our ability to pass through cost to our customers is becoming increasingly more difficult. “Our continental European competitors are getting more relief [following the EU’s recent crisis framework enabling more state aid in this area]. If we leave it to the moment when a chemical plant shuts, restarting those is a very challenging thing to do from a health and safety perspective responsibly.” Over the weekend, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as ministers explore ways to boost Britain’s resilience to international shocks to oil gas markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to record increases in costs. Kwarteng told the Sunday Telegraph that nuclear energy and offshore wind turbines would play a bigger role in energy production, with as many as seven new nuclear plants by 2050. Chemicals companies use disproportionately large amounts of electricity in their processes. Inovyn, a chlorine manufacturer that operates from a plant in Runcorn on the banks of the Mersey, uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Liverpool. Elliott warned that some businesses owned by overseas companies might reconsider their investment in the UK if nothing is done about energy prices. “If you were to ask investors in chemicals around the world, there are good reasons for coming to the UK, but the negative factor has always been energy costs. So UK sites of foreign parents are always marked down on that front and will increasingly be so. Please don’t leave it until we are shutting, because by then it’s probably too late.” Elliott wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in March calling for greater support for UK companies to pay carbon emissions costs, pointing to measures taken by European countries. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We will continue to support energy intensive industries with the costs of energy, and will set out details of further support soon. “Volatile gas prices are a global issue, underscoring the importance of building a strong, homegrown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.” •This article was amended on 4 April 2022 to add a comment from BEIS",

                    "bodyText": "Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week.",

The clean-burning gas could be used to replace fossil gas in factories and refineries, or as a fuel for heavy transport such as shipping, without emitting greenhouse gases.</p>\n    <p>Although hydrogen itself is a clean fuel, the process of producing hydrogen can be extremely polluting. Most of the world’s hydrogen is produced from fossil gas, and releases millions of tons of carbon emissions every year. There are three main types of hydrogen:</p>\n    <p><b>Grey hydrogen<br></b>About 71% of the hydrogen used today is known as \"grey hydrogen\". It is extracted from the methane found in fossil gas, using a process known as steam methane reforming, and releases carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere where it contributes to global heating. It is extremely damaging to the environment.</p>\n    <p><b>Blue hydrogen<br></b>This “low carbon” alternative to grey hydrogen uses carbon capture technology to trap between 85% to 95% of the harmful emissions created by hydrogen production, which could then be transported in pipelines to underground storage facilities such as disused subsea gas caverns under the North Sea. Blue hydrogen is not a net zero fuel because it requires fossil fuel production, which causes emissions and releases up to 15% of the emissions as grey hydrogen.</p>\n    <p><b>Green hydrogen<br></b>Green hydrogen is made by splitting water molecules using an electrolyser powered by renewable electricity. The only byproduct is oxygen which can be safely released into the air. Renewable energy developers believe giant offshore wind farms could be used to power green hydrogen production, particularly overnight when electricity demand is low.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>ScottishPower plans to supply hydrogen to the vehicles and machinery used by the Port of Felixstowe, which is owned by Hutchison Ports, part of Hong Kong based multinational CK Hutchison.</p> \n<p>About 6,000 heavy goods vehicles a year use the port and logistics providers are increasingly studying hydrogen as an option to cut fuel bills and carbon emissions.

The energy company has drawn up proposals for a 100megawatt plant at the Suffolk port which will provide enough fuel to power 1300 hydrogen trucks from 2026. The company, owned by €63bn Spanish utilities giant Iberdrola, said demand for the green fuel had stepped up since petrol and diesel prices began to soar last year, emboldening the firm to invest.

                    "bodyText": "The EU’s foreign ministers are expected to approve suspending the bloc’s visa facilitation agreement with Moscow next week, as Russian rocket and artillery strikes hit areas across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The EU move, aimed at reducing the number of visas issued to Russian nationals after pressure from eastern member states, falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The Financial Times quoted one EU official as saying its was “inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities” and the bloc had to “send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable”. Another told the paper that before the end of the year the bloc aimed to go further than ending the agreement, which would remove the current preferential treatment for Russian citizens when they are applying for any kind of EU visa. The bloc’s foreign ministers are due to meet in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, which hold’s the EU’s rotating presidency, on Tuesday where they are expected to give their political backing to the suspension. However, the bloc is far from united on increasingly vocal demands from countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – many of which have stopped issuing visas to Russians for all but essential travel – for an EU-wide ban on Russian tourists. Many other member states continue to issue travel documents to Russian citizens, meaning they can travel freely throughout the Schengen passport-free zone. Finland, which has said Russians are increasingly dodging the closure of EU airspace by using Helsinki airport as a gateway to the zone, announced this month that it would restrict Russian visa applications to one-tenth of the current number. But countries such as Germany have insisted an outright ban would be misguided, and Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, has argued prohibition is “not a good idea”. The bloc “has to be more selective”, Borrell said last week. On the ground in Ukraine, Russian artillery fired at towns across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, officals said on Sunday, amid mounting concern over a possible radiation disaster. Each sides has accused the other of targeting the plant, which was captured by Russian troops in March but is still run by Ukrainian staff and has become a major hotspot in the conflict, which has now entered its seventh month. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram that Russian forces had struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, two hours’ drive from the plant, while Ukraine’s army command reported that towns had been struck on the opposite bank of the Dnieper from the plant. Moscow said nine Ukrainian artillery shells had landed in the power station’s grounds, technical personnel were monitoring the condition of the site and radiation levels remained normal. None of the reports could be verified. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia had turned the plant into a military base and was putting the whole continent at risk. Both the UN and Kyiv have called for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the plant, which the UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance visit. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are battling for control, shelling hit the strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk but no casualties were reported, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, said. Defenders foiled Russian attempts to break through around the strategic city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Britain’s defence ministry said in its latest briefing that Russia had lost “tens of thousands” of troops and it was not clear how more would be recruited. A decree signed by Vladimir Putin to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9m to 2.04m was unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power, the report said.

It would bring in a traffic light system under which areas deemed to have high environmental value would be protected (a red zone), those with moderate environmental value would be open to development subject to approval processes (orange) and those considered to have lower environmental value would be opened up to rapid development without Commonwealth oversight (green).</p> <p>If well executed, this could expand the parts of the country that are subject to national environment law, and start to factor in cumulative impacts – both necessary steps. But if poorly implemented it could become an arbitrary trade-off, with some nature areas and wildlife sacrificed in return for others being protected.</p> <p>Probably the most controversial element is how the government plans to use environmental offsets. The current use of offsets, under which developments are allowed to go ahead if the developer agrees to protect another existing area, has been an environmental and administrative disaster that has mostly just allowed the destruction of nature.</p> <p>Plibersek says the government will address this by no longer allowing offsets that just protect an existing area while another area is bulldozed. Instead, it would reinforce the mostly ignored “mitigation hierarchy” that places a greater onus on developers to avoid environmental damage and requires a much more substantial investment in environment restoration elsewhere if offsets are used.</p> <p>But conservationists have expressed alarm that the minister plans to entrench a system that would let developers who were unable to find a “like for like” offset to just make a conservation payment to the government. The government suggests the payment would need to be substantial – enough to lead to a “net positive environmental outcome” and make developers think twice about whether they should go ahead as planned.</p> <p>It is not clear how this would work in practice. Would a company be allowed to clear a forest that was home to threatened koalas and greater gliders if they were prepared to pay enough to, say, clean up a couple of polluted rivers?</p> <p>It seems improbable, but the appalling history of offset schemes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/30/utterly-damning-review-finds-offsets-scheme-fails-to-protect-nsw-environment\">explored in depth by Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox</a>) tells us scepticism is a justified starting point. It is tempting to argue conservation would be better served by a simple combination of substantial funding and sharp regulation.</p> <p>Failing that, bring on the details.</p>",

On climate change, there is no trigger, but Plibersek says companies will be required to disclose their emissions within Australia and how they planned to reduce them – which sounds like it could be used as a trigger in all but name, depending on the design. One of the biggest question marks is over a proposal to use regional planning, which has been promised to speed up development. It would bring in a traffic light system under which areas deemed to have high environmental value would be protected (a red zone), those with moderate environmental value would be open to development subject to approval processes (orange) and those considered to have lower environmental value would be opened up to rapid development without Commonwealth oversight (green). If well executed, this could expand the parts of the country that are subject to national environment law, and start to factor in cumulative impacts – both necessary steps. But if poorly implemented it could become an arbitrary trade-off, with some nature areas and wildlife sacrificed in return for others being protected. Probably the most controversial element is how the government plans to use environmental offsets. The current use of offsets, under which developments are allowed to go ahead if the developer agrees to protect another existing area, has been an environmental and administrative disaster that has mostly just allowed the destruction of nature. Plibersek says the government will address this by no longer allowing offsets that just protect an existing area while another area is bulldozed. Instead, it would reinforce the mostly ignored “mitigation hierarchy” that places a greater onus on developers to avoid environmental damage and requires a much more substantial investment in environment restoration elsewhere if offsets are used. But conservationists have expressed alarm that the minister plans to entrench a system that would let developers who were unable to find a “like for like” offset to just make a conservation payment to the government. The government suggests the payment would need to be substantial – enough to lead to a “net positive environmental outcome” and make developers think twice about whether they should go ahead as planned. It is not clear how this would work in practice. Would a company be allowed to clear a forest that was home to threatened koalas and greater gliders if they were prepared to pay enough to, say, clean up a couple of polluted rivers? It seems improbable, but the appalling history of offset schemes (explored in depth by Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox) tells us scepticism is a justified starting point. It is tempting to argue conservation would be better served by a simple combination of substantial funding and sharp regulation. Failing that, bring on the details.",

The US firm CF Industries said soaring natural gas prices meant it would have to “temporarily halt” activity at its remaining UK ammonia plant, which creates CO2 as a byproduct.

As Kwarteng has made clear, that would be likely to require a change in the planning system – which Gove oversees. The Cameron government did not ban new onshore wind developments, but made them subject to stringent local consultation, which ministers admit has been tantamount to a moratorium.

The fresh delays are expected to take the cost of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation to £23bn, EDF Energy said, and put back its launch to the summer of 2026. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Hinkley Point was expected to start up by the end of 2025, at a cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn. However, EDF Energy, which is owned by the French state, said the pandemic had caused delays of three months last year and was expected to lead to similar delays in 2021. “Ten months after it began, we are still facing the full force of the pandemic,” Stuart Crooks, the managing director of Hinkley Point C, said in a video message to employees.

The Covid-19 delays have led to the second major cost increase for Hinkley in under two years after EDF Energy said in 2019 that construction costs had climbed by up to £2.9bn because of delays. Hinkley Point’s costs have risen by £5bn in the last five years. It will cost almost double the amount to build as first thought in 2008, and will begin generating electricity almost a decade later than the original start date of Christmas 2017.

Joe Biden made some remarks in Washington on manufacturing and infrastructure. A federal appeals court ruled that the Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured. Speaking of Poland, a bipartisan group of senators are calling on Joe Biden to expedite the sale of arms to the country amid tensions: Amid the unrest in Europe, vice-president Kamala Harris will head to Poland and Romania next week to reaffirm the US-Nato alliance: And we finally have a statement from Donald Trump about Bill Barr, his second attorney general and the author of a book, out next week but extensively trailed, in which he says his former boss was unfit to be president and still will be if he chooses to run again. In Trump’s words, Barr… … wouldn’t know voter fraud if it was staring him in the face – and it was. The fact is, he was weak, ineffective, and totally scared of being impeached, which the Democrats were constantly threatening to do. They ‘broke’ him. He should have acted much faster on the Mueller Report, instead of allowing the fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Hoax to linger for so long, but it was the Election Fraud and Irregularities that he refused to act on because he wanted to save his own hide – and he did. He never got impeached, contempt charges never went forward, and the Democrats were very happy with him – but I wasn’t. In Barr’s words – and to be fair, the words of many others – Trump’s lie about election fraud was just that, a lie. Barr resigned on 14 December 2020, at a meeting at which Trump gave him a bogus report about supposed fraud in Antrim county, Michigan, which he kept pushing on subordinates after that, as his attempt to overturn the election ran on and up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Here’s more about Barr’s book – what’s in it and, more to the point, what isn’t: A little tidbit from Joe Biden and his meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland: Last night, the Florida senate passed a bill banning access to abortions after 15 weeks. Vice-president Kamala Harris issued a statement today that “the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body and determine her future”. “The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is non-negotiable,” she said. Former vice-president Mike Pence reportedly will call on Republicans to stop repeating the lie that Donald Trump keeps peddling that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. White House press secretary Jen Psaki fielded a question about Lindsey Graham and his comments calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. “That is not the position of the United States government that is certainly not the statement you would hear coming from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” she said. When pressed further on the topic – on whether Joe Biden agreed with Graham that Putin’s death was the only way out of this war – Psaki staunchly doubled down. “The president believes there continues to be a diplomatic path forward,” she said. “President Putin has the ability to deescalate. We have left the door open for months now to engage in deescalation.” Psaki continued: “We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change. That is not the policy of the United States.” Read more about the outcry against Graham’s comments here: White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. The US embassy in Ukraine called the attack on the nuclear plant a war crime. But Psaki said the determination of Russia’s war crimes is still an ongoing process that is taking place within the administration. “It’s a legal review and a process that goes through the administration,” Psaki said. “What I will say, the intentional targeting of civilians or civilian objects would be considered a war crime. Regardless of legality, this action was the height of irresponsibility. The Kremlin must cease operations around nuclear infrastructure.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki is at the podium for her press briefing and she began with the administration’s request to Congress for more funding for Ukraine. Since 2021, the US has already provided more than $1.4bn to Ukraine, and administration officials are now requesting $10bn more to “deliver additional security assistance to Ukraine, to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian people and more support for stronger sanction enforcement and for US troop deployment to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank and deter Russian aggression,” Psaki said. Back to the no-fly zone and whether it can be implemented in other ways than shooting down Russian jets, and how the US assesses Russian military strength after a week of war. Blinken says the US is looking at what can be delivered to Ukraine for it to defend itself, every day. On conclusions about Russian military strength, Blinken says he doesn’t want to draw any yet. What we do know, he says, is “how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are. Their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future. “That’s the story of the past week and it’s an incredibly powerful one.” And with that, he’s gone. Blinken is asked if energy sanctions on Russia are being considered. “As a general proposition, nothing is off the table,” he says, adding that minimising harm to the US and partners and allies is also part of implementing sanctions, which means the US wants to avoid raising prices at the pumps at home. “We have a strong interest in degrading Russia status as a leading energy supplier. Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift. That’s why Nord Stream two was shut down. “That’s why we’re surging [liquid natural gas] to Europe right now, to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas. It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration … this is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.” Blinken is asked how many more people have to die before energy sanctions are used but he avoids a direct answer, of course. Secretary of state Antony Blinken has just issued a fresh warning about the war, echoing other leaders of late who have warned that the worst is ahead. An Irish questioner asks how much worse things are going to get in Ukraine, and if “the no to the no fly zone is set in stone completely or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre? “And just to follow up – Was it naive of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin for diplomacy?” “I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken says. With regard to the no fly zone, Blinken cites Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato general secretary, in saying that Nato has a responsibility to “ensure the war doesn’t spill over beyond Ukraine”. Shooting down Russian planes could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, Blinken says. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia. But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide Ukrainians with the means to to effectively defend themselves. And of course, we’re seeing every single day, their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in in what they’re doing to achieve that.” About potential naivety, Blinken says the US was “the opposite of naive” and had warned for months that Putin was planning “an aggression of Ukraine”, and was prepared either way. Blinken is asked if nothing the west and Nato has done has slowed the Russian invasion so far, what does he tell the Ukrainian people. He is also asked if arms supplies can be increased, to include heavier weapons such as jets. Blinken takes the second part first. He’s in contact constantly with the Ukrainian government, he says, and touts how much security assistance has already been given. He says Nato and the EU have discussed “what more we can do and how to do it effectively”, with the foreign minister of Ukraine contributing. “We’re working on that every day,” he adds. No specifics – no surprise there. He touts damage to the Russian economy as a result of sanctions and so forth. “I have a list five pages long of all the businesses that have left Russia,” Blinken says, adding: “Let’s see how Russia responds to that.” “Unfortunately this is not like flipping a lightswitch,” he says about the prospects of increasing aid and implementing harsher measures, even though “virtually the entire world” supports Ukraine. “There is a huge weight bearing down on Russia,” he says. “Let’s see what the impact is.” Of the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant yesterday, Blinken says: “The Kremlin should immediately cease all attacks around Ukrainian nuclear facilities and allow civilian personnel do their work to ensure the facilities’ safety and security, as both the IAEA director general and a resolution adopted yesterday by the agency’s board of governors have called on Russia to do.” He says Nato, the EU and other partner nations have never before worked so closely together. He praises those countries which have accepted Ukrainian refugees. Humanitarian corridors are being worked on, he said, to allow people out and supplies in. He says Vladimir Putin cannot have imagined the united response and the tide of protest that has “increasingly turned Russia into a pariah state”. “We do not oppose the Russian people,” Blinken says. He also says the US “will defend every inch of Nato territory”, if necessary. He takes questions. Here’s our latest reporting on the fighting in Ukraine: Tony Blinken is now speaking in Brussels. “Stability in Europe hangs in the balance and the international rules based order that’s critical to maintaining peace and security is being put to the test by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,” he says, to begin. Here’s the state department stream. The Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured, a federal appeals court ruled today. The mixed ruling on concerning the increasingly-controversial Title 42 rule largely upholds restrictions put in place by the administration of former Republican president Donald Trump aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 even as many other coronavirus-related border bans have been lifted. Reuters writes: A group of affected migrants, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other non-profit organizations, sued over the expulsion policy known as Title 42, which the administration of Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office a year ago, has largely kept in place. They argued the expulsions were illegal but the panel of appeals court judges disagreed, finding it likely that the covered migrants “have no right to be in the United States, and the Executive can immediately expel them.” The court added however, that “the Executive cannot remove aliens to a country where their ’life or freedom would be threatened’ on account of their ’race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion’” or “to a country where they will likely be tortured.“ Biden has fought to retain the Title 42 order, which was issued in March 2020 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many Democrats, health experts and pro-immigrant advocates oppose the order, saying it unlawfully cuts off access to asylum and is not supported by scientific evidence. Border arrests soared to record levels in 2021 during Biden’s first year in office and could climb even higher this year, officials told Reuters in January. A federal judge ruled last September that the Title 42 policy could not be applied to families but the Biden administration appealed that decision. Early in his presidency, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the expulsion policy. Since Biden took office in January 2020, more than a million migrants have been expelled under the order. Many of those have been people who have crossed the border more than once. Joe Biden did not take questions at his event on manufacturing and infrastructure, and therefore did not make any new comment on the Ukraine crisis. His secretary of state, Tony Blinken, is however due to talk in Brussels soon. The Department of State live stream is here. Biden describes his administration’s efforts to make the federal government buy more American goods, including making agencies which want to spend money abroad publicly seek waivers to do so. He ties this effort back to the early days of the pandemic, when states and cities had to buy PPE and Covid tests abroad. “Yes, we’re going to keep trading with our allies and friends,” Biden says, saying the US also needs “resilient supply chains of our own” – a nod to difficulties affecting many sectors of the economy which are likely to be worsened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Last year,” Biden says, “I released a plan to increase the number of contracts that go to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025. This means more contracts will go to Black-, brown-, Asian American-, women-owned and veteran-owned small businesses in every state and territory, in every industry, from services to manufacturing to agriculture.” And with that, he thanks everyone in attendance and leaves the stage without taking questions. Joe Biden begins with a joke and a happy birthday to an aide, and thanks to the other speakers. He then revisits his State of the Union remarks about economic progress on his watch, touting various successes. “This is what it looks like to grow an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,” the president says. He also underlines progress against the coronavirus pandemic, after “two of the hardest years this country has ever faced”. “We’re coming back stronger as a country,” he says. So is American manufacturing, the president says, with companies investing at home rather than overseas. He gives examples of companies “innovating and inspiring” other companies, Tesla among them. He says he just had a “viral” (he means virtual) tour of Siemens facilities around the US. Joe Biden is speaking in Washington, about his infrastructure policy and spending. The great Joan E Greve covered some of the why, and the role of Siemens, here earlier. The White House stream is here. America is divided. That’s not news. But the authoritarian ruler in the Kremlin deciding to invade a democratic neighbor – that’s the type of international crisis that traditionally might have inspired some closing of the ranks: set differences aside, let domestic quarrels rest. But conservatives are evidently out on the idea of patriotic unity. The right’s reactions to Russia’s attack on Ukraine have ranged from blatant admiration for Vladimir Putin to anti-Russian saber-rattling combined with a shrill critique of Joe Biden. Donald Trump initially called the invasion “genius”; he then defended his position at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend, adding that Nato was “not so smart” and “our leaders are dumb.” Meanwhile, America’s most successful cable news host Tucker Carlson ridiculed American solidarity with Ukraine, a country he derided as “a tyranny”, led by “the people who paid off Joe Biden’s family”. Trump is the political leader of the Republican party and probably its next presidential candidate. Carlson is one of the premier rightwing culture warriors in the country. Trump and Carlson are not fringe voices, and they aren’t outliers either: a last week’s CPAC, conservative speakers focused their ire on Biden’s supposed weakness as the real cause for Putin’s aggression; and they left no doubt who they considered the biggest threat – the “enemy within”, as Senator Rick Scott put it, the “militant left – wing in our country”. Full column: Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is in Brussels to meet with the foreign ministers of Nato and European Council. Ahead of his meetings, he warned that Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, will open “a Pandora’s box of trouble” for entire world if he continues his attack on Ukraine. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said “Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now”. Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Putin. Close Donald Trump ally Roger Stone raged at the former US president in the aftermath of the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a blockbuster report from the Washington Post, telling a friend Trump was a “disgrace” who would go to prison and adding: “He betrayed everybody.” The Post said it had viewed 20 hours of footage of the political operative that had been shot for a forthcoming documentary. The footage, it said, showed Stone: Meeting and corresponding with members of a far-right militia since indicted for seditious conspiracy over the Capitol riot on January 6. Discussing a plan in which Trump would issue a blanket pardon to co-conspirators in the attempt to overturn the election, Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Jim Jordan among them. Saying Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, should be “punished” in a way that would leave him “braindead”. Suggesting violence against protesters for racial justice would be possible with the election out of the way. “Once there’s no more election,” Stone reportedly said, “there’s no reason why we can’t mix it up. These people are going to get what they’ve been asking for.” Full story: The supreme court has reinstated the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man convicted of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 that killed three people and injured hundreds of others. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, had harsh words about the attack, saying it was “incredibly reckless and dangerous and it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe”. “By the grace of god, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” she said. While she had a strong message about the escalation to attacks on nuclear plants - “nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict” - Thomas-Greenfield went harder on the overall war itself. “Russia’s invasion has turned half a million children into refugees,” she said. “Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainians and sacrificed thousand more Russian soldiers’ lives in the process. Russia is destroying critical infrastructure, which is denying people drinking water to stay alive and gas that is preventing people from freezing to death in the middle of winter. The humanitarian impact of this destruction will be significant.” She continued: “One hundred and forty-one nations across the world have called loudly and clearly on President Putin to stop this brutal, unjustified, unprovoked attack. Not only has he not listened, we just witnessed a dangerous new escalation that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world. “To my Russian counterparts: This council needs answers. We need to hear you say, this won’t happen again,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “We call on you to withdraw your troops and weaponry from Ukraine. We call on you to respect Ukraine’s borders, its people and the UN charter. We call on you to respect your own troops enough to not send them into an unjust war, or on a suicide mission against a nuclear power plant.” Thomas-Greenfield finished by noting that Russian forces are now 20 miles away from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility. “This imminent danger continues,” she said. “President Putin must stop this humanitarian catastrophe by ending this war and ceasing these unconscionable attacks against the people of Ukraine,” she said. “Mr Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now.” Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Though Finland already cooperates with Nato, the country is not a member. Support for full membership has grown in the country in the days since the invasion: A poll by public broadcaster Yle last Monday said 53% of Finns support joining. In late January, the number was just 28% when the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper asked the question. Biden and Niinisto “will discuss the US-Finnish defense relationship, which is very strong and in fact complements Finland’s close partnership with Nato”, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters ahead of the visit. Niinisto said in a statement that people should “keep a cool head and assess carefully the impact of the changes that have already taken place and of those that might still happen.” Siemens has announced that it will invest $54m to expand US production of electrical parts, which will aid in the construction of everything from electric vehicle chargers to data centers. Siemens said the investment will lead to the creation of 300 manufacturing jobs in the country. The CEO of Siemens USA, Barbara Humpton, is expected to join Joe Biden at the White House today to celebrate the new investment. The White House championed Siemens’ announcement as the latest indication of how Biden’s “Made in America” agenda is strengthening US supply chains and creating good-paying jobs. “You may recall the previous administration made big claims on how they would restore America’s industrial might. That turned out to be just rhetoric,” a senior administration official said. “President Biden followed through on his commitment to make ‘Buy American’ real.” In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Biden emphasized his commitment to reinvigorating US manufacturing to strengthen both the economy as a whole and individual families’ financial prospects. “There’s something happening in America,” Biden said Tuesday. “Just look around, and you’ll see an amazing story – the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products ‘Made in America,’ the revitalization of American manufacturing.” Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, is now heading out of his meeting with Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels and going into one with the European Council, the policy-guiding arm of the European Union. Before his next meeting, Blinken took a moment to speak to the press along with Josep Borrell, the vice president of the European Commission, and applaud the EU on taking “historic” action, “both with regard to sanctions and support for Ukraine”. “We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice, a war that was unprovoked and that is having horrific consequences for real people, for mothers, fathers, for children,” Blinken said. “We see the images on TV and it has to stop. We are committed to doing everything we can to make it stop.” Blinken continued: “We’ve established together, after two world wars, that are so important to keeping peace and security for everyone, principles that President Putin is egregiously violating every single day - the notion that one country can’t simply go in and change the borders of another country by force or take it over, the principle that one country cannot dictate to another the choices that its citizens would make about their future, the principle that we are past the time of spheres of influence where one country subjugates its neighbors to its will. “All of those things are at stake and if we allow those principles to be challenged as Putin is doing now with impunity, that will open a Pandora’s box of trouble, not just for us, but, quite frankly, for the entire world.” As part of his “Made in America” agenda to bolster the country’s manufacturing sector, Joe Biden is also implementing changes to the Buy American Act. As of now, products under consideration for federal procurement qualify as being made in America if 55% of the value of their component parts are domestically manufactured. The Biden administration will change that threshold to 75% by 2029, with incremental increases to the requirement over the next seven years. A senior administration official explained that the incremental nature of the policy change would “allow both small and large contractors time to transition their supply chains to domestic suppliers and to increase their use of American-made components”. “It marks just one of many significant improvements to domestic sourcing policy that the Biden-Harris administration will be rolling out to ensure that taxpayer dollars help America’s businesses compete in strategic industries and help America’s workers thrive,” the official said. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. However, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg hedged their position a bit this morning, rejecting Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told reporters. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Stoltenberg said. Politico took a look at the cracking opposition to the US agreeing to aiding in a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Right now, Joe Biden is in the tricky position of remaining true to his promise to protect Nato territories without escalating into further war with Russia, while at the same time getting more and more pressure to intervene in a way that won’t lead to boots on the ground. On Friday. Nato allies rejected Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said. But in Washington, Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger is pushing for a no-fly zone. Politico is reporting that Republican senator Roger Wicker is also in support, as well as Democratic policymakers like Evelyn Farkas, the top official for Ukraine in the Obama Pentagon. Amid soaring tensions and continuous bloodshed in Ukraine, conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. The Republican senator from South Carolina made his remarks first on Fox News with Sean Hannity - who has suggested assassinating Putin previously - before repeating his sentiments on Twitter. Graham’s remarks were met with dismay from both sides of the aisle, with progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeting, “Seriously, wtf?” Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, also responded by calling Graham’s remarks “an exceptionally bad idea”. Even far-right extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, who won her seat expressing support for the conspiracy theory QAnon, called Graham’s statements “irresponsible, dangerous and unhinged”. “We need leaders with calm minds and steady wisdom,” she tweeted. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.” Greetings, live blog readers. Happy Friday. Per usual, we’ll have all our live updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine here, so make sure to keep an eye on that. But on our end, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. Meanwhile in Washington, the Washington Post is reporting that previously unseen documentary footage shows Roger Stone, longtime ally of Donald Trump, working to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and secure pardons in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. We’ll have more on that in a bit. Stay tuned.",

                    "bodyText": "The US and South Korea have begun their biggest joint military drills in years – a show of force that is expected to raise tensions with an increasingly hostile North Korea. The exercises, known as Ulchi Freedom Shield, are being seen as a sign of the allies’ determination to restore large-scale training after they cancelled some regular drills and scaled down others to facilitate nuclear talks, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of the operation have not been released, but past exercises have involved tens of thousands of troops and large numbers of aircraft warships and tanks. They will reportedly include simulated joint attacks, frontline reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The two militaries said in a joint statement said the drills were a response to an “increased volume and scale of [North Korean] missile tests” over the past year. “With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat … both leaders committed to expanding the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training, they said, adding that Ulchi Freedom Shield would “bolster combined readiness”. The 2019 exercises were cancelled after Donald Trump’s first summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, the previous year. Trump’s surprise concession was seen as an attempt to persuade Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme amid a flurry of diplomacy led by the then president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in. Four years on, Washington and Seoul have nothing substantive to show for their efforts at engagement. The North has resumed missile tests – including its first launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range since 2017 – and speculation is building that it is preparing to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test. The US has said it will consider deploying strategic assets – which could theoretically include tactical nuclear weapons – if the North tests a nuclear device. South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, took office in May promising a harder line against North Korean provocations that would include “normalising” the military exercises and boosting his country’s defences against the North. The resumption of the drills suggests that South Korea and the US, which has 28,500 troops in the country, have reverted to robust displays of their combined military might in the wake of North Korea’s resumption of ballistic missile tests. “The significance of this joint exercise is rebuilding the South Korea-US alliance and solidifying the combined defence posture by normalising … combined exercises and field training,” the South Korean defence ministry said. While the allies insist the field exercises are designed to plan their response to a North Korean attack, Pyongyang routinely condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion, and in the past has responded with missile launches. The drills, which will end on 1 September, began against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the North. It recently warned of “deadly retaliation” against the South, which it blamed for its Covid-19 outbreak, while Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s influential sister, last week dismissed Yoon’s offer of economic help in return for denuclearising as “absurd”, warning that the North would never “barter” its nuclear deterrent for aid. Kim Jong-un, whose until recently appears to have been focused on containing the coronavirus outbreak, has said his country is “ready to mobilise” its nuclear capability in any war with the US and North Korea, although the regime has always insisted its nuclear weapons are a deterrent against a “hostile” US. In a TV interview last month, Choe Jin, the deputy director of a thinktank run by North Korea’s foreign ministry, said the US and South Korea would face “unprecedented” security challenges unless they abandoned their “hostile military stance” against the North, including joint drills. The North has been conducting missile tests at a record pace, with more than 30 ballistic missile launches this year, as it continues to pressure Washington to accept its status as a legitimate nuclear power – and one that some experts believe now has the ability to carry out a nuclear strike against the US mainland.",

                    "bodyText": "Japan’s decision to release more than 1m tonnes of treated radioactive water from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea has sparked controversy inside and outside the country. Here are some questions and answers about the plan, which is expected to take decades to complete. What is the processed water? Since the 2011 nuclear disaster, radioactive water has accumulated at the plant, including liquid used for cooling, and rain and groundwater that has seeped in. An extensive pumping and filtration system known as Alps (advanced liquid processing system) extracts tonnes of newly contaminated water each day and filters out most radioactive elements. The plant operator, Tepco, has built more than 1,000 tanks to hold some 1.25m tonnes of processed water at the site but they will be full by the second half of 2022. The Alps process removes most of the radioactive isotopes to levels below international safety guidelines for nuclear plant waste water. But it cannot remove some, including tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that experts say is only harmful to humans in very large doses. The half-life of tritium – the time needed for one half the atoms of a radioactive isotope to decay – is 12.3 years. In humans, it has an estimated biological half-life of seven to 10 days. How will it be released? Japan’s government has backed a plan to dilute the processed water and release it into the sea. The government says the process meets international standards, and it has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Releasing into the ocean is done elsewhere,” IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said. “It’s not something new. There is no scandal here.” The release is not likely to begin for at least two years and will take decades. A government spokesman, Katsunobo Kato, said the dilution would reduce tritium levels to well below standards set domestically and by the World Health Organization for drinking water, with IAEA supervision. Why is it controversial? Environmental groups like Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, say radioactive materials like carbon-14 that remain in the water can “be easily concentrated in the food chain”. They allege that accumulated doses over time could damage DNA, and want to see the water stored until technology is developed to improve filtration. Local fishing communities worry that years of work to convince consumers that Fukushima’s seafood is safe will be wiped out by the release. “The message from the government that the water is safe is not reaching the public, that’s the huge problem,” an official with the association of Fukushima fishermen unions told Agence France-Presse. He said trading partners had warned they would stop selling their products and consumers had said they would stop eating Fukushima seafood if the water were released: “Our efforts in the past decade to restore the fish industry will be for nothing.” What about Fukushima seafood? The government says radioactive elements in the water are far below international standards, pointing out that waste water is regularly discharged from nuclear plants elsewhere. Even releasing all the stored water in a single year would produce “no more than one-thousandth the exposure impact of natural radiation in Japan,” the foreign ministry said in a reply to a UN report. For food, Japan nationally sets a standard of no more than 100 becquerels of radioactivity per kilogram (Bq/kg), compared with 1,250 Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200 in the US. But for Fukushima produce, the level is set even lower, at just 50 Bq/kg, in an attempt to win consumer trust. Hundreds of thousands of food items have been tested in the region since 2011. What do scientists say? Michiaki Kai, an expert on radiation risk assessment at Japan’s Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, said it was important to control the dilution and volume of released water. But “there is consensus among scientists that the impact on health is minuscule”, he told AFP. Still, “it can’t be said the risk is zero, which is what causes controversy”. Geraldine Thomas, chair of molecular pathology at Imperial College London and an expert on radiation, said tritium “does not pose a health risk at all – and particularly so when you factor in the dilution factor of the Pacific Ocean”. She said carbon-14 was also not a health risk, arguing that chemical contaminants in seawater like mercury should concern consumers more “than anything that comes from the Fukushima site”. On eating Fukushima seafood, “I would have no hesitation whatsoever,” she added.",

The two halves of GKN have always looked destined to go different ways eventually, and separation allows both companies to hunt for bolt-on acquisitions. But, as a way to “unlock value for shareholders” – the other ambition – there is work to do. Melrose’s shares fell 9%. It was a reminder that, in the end, the private equity model requires a crystallisation event, in deal-making lingo. A demerger doesn’t qualify on that score.",

                    "bodyText": "Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling” on Monday, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The US has rejected Ukraine’s call for a blanket ban on visas for Russians, saying Washington would not want to close off pathways to refuge for Russia’s dissidents and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) said exports from two of its three mooring points at a Black Sea terminal had been suspended. A senior Russian diplomat has ruled out a diplomatic solution to ending the war in Ukraine. Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times that there would be no direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Moscow expects a prolonged conflict.",

The Reserve Bank governor’s ominous warning that the cash rate will keep rising as long as inflation continues its own upward trajectory is the sobering backdrop this morning to research showing that hundreds of thousands of people are missing out on energy bill concessions worth up to $372 a year.

Full Story Why Peter Dutton’s nuclear power plan doesn’t stack up Peter Dutton’s enthusiasm for nuclear energy looks like an excuse for delay on renewables, argues our climate and environment editor Adam Morton. In-depth Six places in Sydney are in the top 10 of the wettest locations in Australia this year, BoM figures on average rainfall show. One site, Marrickville golf club, has recorded 2,154mm of rain – 213.1% of its annual mean of 1,010.8mm. In all, New South Wales takes nine places in the chart with Maree in South Australia the outlier.

                    "body": "<p>Since its height in 1911, when census figures recorded almost a million Welsh speakers aged three and over in Wales, the Welsh language has been in a near-permanent state of crisis. Fewer opportunities to speak Welsh at home and school, coupled with a long-term trend of people migrating from Wales, have caused a decline in the number of Welsh speakers. A recent Office for National Statistics estimate indicates that about 895,000 people speak Welsh, but a lower figure is expected when the 2021 census data is <a href=\"https://census.gov.uk/census-2021-results/phase-one-topic-summaries/welsh-language\">published</a>, on 6 December. Now, another factor is contributing to the decline of the Welsh language: the steady rise of second homes.</p> <p>It’s easy to see why Wales, with its stunning coastline and rural landscapes, has become a favoured location for holiday homes. But the growth in second homes is having a corrosive effect on the Welsh language. In some places, the concentration of second homes is so high that up to 46% of the local housing stock can be empty for parts of the year. In places like Gwynedd, one in every ten homes is a second home. According to <a href=\"https://research.senedd.wales/research-articles/second-homes-what-s-happening-in-wales/\">government figures</a>, there are currently 23, 974 second homes in Wales. This figure is likely to be an underestimate, as many homes are used as short-term, self-catering accommodation. Because these homes are registered as businesses, they do not appear on council tax lists.</p> <p>The rise of second homes is contributing to rising house prices. This is pushing out many younger Welsh speakers, who feel understandably aggrieved that they have to leave their home communities. As more communities become places for holiday lets, rural and <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/small-schools-shut-wales-last-22485278\">village schools close</a>. This in turn weakens the predominance of Welsh as the default language in particular communities, causing the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/08/second-homes-and-brexit-pushing-welsh-language-to-tipping-point\">anglicisation</a>” of Welsh-speaking towns and villages, according to Simon Brooks, chair of the <a href=\"https://gov.wales/launch-commission-welsh-speaking-communities\">Commission for Welsh-speaking Communities</a>.</p> <p>Geography and place matter for language. Once a minority language is no longer spoken on the street, at school, or in social and community life, its resonance changes. A language instead becomes rooted in the education system as a skill to be acquired, rather than a spoken part of everyday life. Without opportunities to speak Welsh on a daily basis as part of a community, Welsh speakers may find themselves less able or confident about initiating conversations in Welsh – particularly when they’re dealing with the health service, the government and other services.</p> <p>The case for preserving a Welsh-speaking heartland has been in the public consciousness since the 1920s.<em> </em>More recently, campaigns by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith (the Welsh Language Society) have spearheaded the fight for language rights while tying the Welsh language to a broader set of social and economic issues, seeing the preservation of Welsh as the key to preventing the erosion of communities and quality of life.</p> <p>Inspired by ecological and cultural preservation movements, a raft of recent proposals has attempted to counter the decline of Welsh. Planning policies allow local authorities to consider the Welsh language in planning decisions (the Horizon nuclear power proposal on Anglesey was subject to both an environmental assessment and a Welsh language assessment). Given the rapid rise in housing costs and lack of affordable housing, these planning policies need updating. They could, for example, give a higher weighting to developments that strengthen the survival of the Welsh language, or allocate more resources to local authority programmes that would preserve the language, tackle poverty and improve the services available to Welsh-speaking communities.</p> <p>The Commission for Welsh Speaking Communities was established earlier this year by the Welsh government. It will publish its first report in 2024, and will probably recommend that homeowners obtain planning permission to change their property into a second home. Another proposal could be a variable tax of up to 300% on second homes in particular areas. In addition to this, the Welsh government could strengthen some of the initiatives in community-led housing, such as community ownership models that would transfer property and land to local housing associations or social enterprises, helping to alleviate the housing crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/08/second-homes-and-brexit-pushing-welsh-language-to-tipping-point\">Second homes and Brexit pushing Welsh language to ‘tipping point’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>A more radical policy would involve offering tax incentives to encourage people to remain in their areas, or to encourage Welsh-speaking newcomers to move into “threatened” areas. Farmers have been paid levies to nurture endangered landscapes, so why not pay Welsh speakers a similar levy to move to an endangered community and help keep the language alive?</p> <p>Despite the erosion of Welsh-speaking communities in north and west Wales, there is still plenty to be hopeful about. Cardiff’s council leader, Huw Thomas, has committed to establishing more Welsh-speaking schools and offering more classes taught in Welsh at English-speaking schools.<em> </em>In other authority areas, there are plans to create Welsh streams in English-speaking schools and to open dual language schools. Meanwhile, initiatives such as the Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol’s (National Centre for Learning Welsh)“Siarad” scheme pairs new speakers with proficient native speakers, giving language learners informal opportunities to mix in places where Welsh is dominant.</p> <p>Many people learning Welsh are likely to see the language as a utilitarian skill they need in order to get a job in particular sectors, rather than as a language for social interaction. To show why Welsh is an important foundation for people living in and contributing to Welsh society, we need leadership and inspiration. Linguistic and community decline is not inevitable. Given the national and local will, there’s no reason we can’t safeguard the Welsh language for future generations.</p> <ul> <li><p>Colin Williams is a professor at Cardiff University’s School of Welsh and a senior research associate at Cambridge University</p></li> </ul> <p>• This article was amended on 24 November 2022. The Welsh Language Society should have had its Welsh name, Cymdeithas yr Iaith, first and not its English translation.

The translation of Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol has also been corrected.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Since its height in 1911, when census figures recorded almost a million Welsh speakers aged three and over in Wales, the Welsh language has been in a near-permanent state of crisis. Fewer opportunities to speak Welsh at home and school, coupled with a long-term trend of people migrating from Wales, have caused a decline in the number of Welsh speakers. A recent Office for National Statistics estimate indicates that about 895,000 people speak Welsh, but a lower figure is expected when the 2021 census data is published, on 6 December. Now, another factor is contributing to the decline of the Welsh language: the steady rise of second homes. It’s easy to see why Wales, with its stunning coastline and rural landscapes, has become a favoured location for holiday homes. But the growth in second homes is having a corrosive effect on the Welsh language. In some places, the concentration of second homes is so high that up to 46% of the local housing stock can be empty for parts of the year. In places like Gwynedd, one in every ten homes is a second home. According to government figures, there are currently 23, 974 second homes in Wales. This figure is likely to be an underestimate, as many homes are used as short-term, self-catering accommodation. Because these homes are registered as businesses, they do not appear on council tax lists. The rise of second homes is contributing to rising house prices. This is pushing out many younger Welsh speakers, who feel understandably aggrieved that they have to leave their home communities. As more communities become places for holiday lets, rural and village schools close. This in turn weakens the predominance of Welsh as the default language in particular communities, causing the “anglicisation” of Welsh-speaking towns and villages, according to Simon Brooks, chair of the Commission for Welsh-speaking Communities. Geography and place matter for language. Once a minority language is no longer spoken on the street, at school, or in social and community life, its resonance changes. A language instead becomes rooted in the education system as a skill to be acquired, rather than a spoken part of everyday life. Without opportunities to speak Welsh on a daily basis as part of a community, Welsh speakers may find themselves less able or confident about initiating conversations in Welsh – particularly when they’re dealing with the health service, the government and other services. The case for preserving a Welsh-speaking heartland has been in the public consciousness since the 1920s. More recently, campaigns by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith (the Welsh Language Society) have spearheaded the fight for language rights while tying the Welsh language to a broader set of social and economic issues, seeing the preservation of Welsh as the key to preventing the erosion of communities and quality of life. Inspired by ecological and cultural preservation movements, a raft of recent proposals has attempted to counter the decline of Welsh. Planning policies allow local authorities to consider the Welsh language in planning decisions (the Horizon nuclear power proposal on Anglesey was subject to both an environmental assessment and a Welsh language assessment). Given the rapid rise in housing costs and lack of affordable housing, these planning policies need updating. They could, for example, give a higher weighting to developments that strengthen the survival of the Welsh language, or allocate more resources to local authority programmes that would preserve the language, tackle poverty and improve the services available to Welsh-speaking communities. The Commission for Welsh Speaking Communities was established earlier this year by the Welsh government. It will publish its first report in 2024, and will probably recommend that homeowners obtain planning permission to change their property into a second home. Another proposal could be a variable tax of up to 300% on second homes in particular areas. In addition to this, the Welsh government could strengthen some of the initiatives in community-led housing, such as community ownership models that would transfer property and land to local housing associations or social enterprises, helping to alleviate the housing crisis. A more radical policy would involve offering tax incentives to encourage people to remain in their areas, or to encourage Welsh-speaking newcomers to move into “threatened” areas. Farmers have been paid levies to nurture endangered landscapes, so why not pay Welsh speakers a similar levy to move to an endangered community and help keep the language alive? Despite the erosion of Welsh-speaking communities in north and west Wales, there is still plenty to be hopeful about. Cardiff’s council leader, Huw Thomas, has committed to establishing more Welsh-speaking schools and offering more classes taught in Welsh at English-speaking schools. In other authority areas, there are plans to create Welsh streams in English-speaking schools and to open dual language schools. Meanwhile, initiatives such as the Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol’s (National Centre for Learning Welsh)“Siarad” scheme pairs new speakers with proficient native speakers, giving language learners informal opportunities to mix in places where Welsh is dominant. Many people learning Welsh are likely to see the language as a utilitarian skill they need in order to get a job in particular sectors, rather than as a language for social interaction. To show why Welsh is an important foundation for people living in and contributing to Welsh society, we need leadership and inspiration. Linguistic and community decline is not inevitable. Given the national and local will, there’s no reason we can’t safeguard the Welsh language for future generations. Colin Williams is a professor at Cardiff University’s School of Welsh and a senior research associate at Cambridge University • This article was amended on 24 November 2022. The Welsh Language Society should have had its Welsh name, Cymdeithas yr Iaith, first and not its English translation. Nid yw Cymru ar Werth is not an organisation as a previous version said, but a Cymdeithas yr Iaith campaign; and another group, Cymuned, no longer exists. The translation of Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol has also been corrected.",

Then in April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/12/breadfruit-cherries-and-drag-this-is-a-lip-smacking-turner-prize-shortlist\">she was nominated for the Turner prize</a>, commended by a jury “struck by bold new developments” in her recent work as well as for the way she has “for decades […] uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight”.</p> <p>In works ranging from The Cost of the English Landscape (1989), which connected romantic visions of the Lake District with references to the slave trade and nuclear power production at Sellafield, to Landscape Trauma<em> </em>(2001), where the geological structures of Northumbrian rock formations are writ large on vast photographic panels, Pollard has, for more than 40 years, reflected the inadequacy of simplistic narratives about England’s landscape and in contrast offered an artistic vision of engagement with the natural world that grasps, above all, its movement and complexity.</p> <p>A new series of kinetic sculptures will, in this vein, crown her contribution to the Turner prize exhibition that opens at Tate Liverpool in October. Until then, perhaps the best evidence around that here is an artist who, at 69, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/28/bernardine-evaristo-on-the-artistic-triumph-of-older-black-women\">only now coming into the peak of her creative powers</a>, is to be found off the beaten track, at the <a href=\"https://thelmahulbert.com/\">Thelma Hulbert Gallery in Honiton</a>, east Devon, where a new solo show, Three Drops of Blood, brings together Pollard’s recent engagement with 19th-century botanical collections and East Devon’s history as a former world centre of lace-manufacturing with her own enduring concern with questions of race and the legacies of empire.</p> <p>Curated by Devon-based <a href=\"https://www.talkingoncorners.co.uk/\">Talking on Corners</a> (AKA Ella S Mills, whose art historical research has focused on <a href=\"https://awarewomenartists.com/en/magazine/les-femmes-du-british-black-arts-movement/\">female figures of the British Black Arts Movements </a>including Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson), the exhibition marks the culmination of two years’ research by Pollard across the county including at the Devon and Exeter Institution where, among other details, she unearthed folk histories of the fern. This element runs through the show connecting perfect reproductions of xylotheks – wooden boxes used for storing tree specimens – and classification-photography, with contemporary reflections by the Antiguan American writer <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/jamaica-kincaid\">Jamaica Kincaid</a> on communing with people and plants in the Himalayas, and of ways other than colonial adventure of being in the world.</p> <p>The fern, it transpires, is part of our ancient landscape, dating back more than 300m years, and predating even the advent of dinosaurs, to the Carboniferous period. Its reproduction was for centuries a mystery – no flowers or pods – inspiring beliefs of magical agency. It was said, for example, that anyone who held invisible fern seeds would be invisible too, and that by shooting them into the sun with an arrow on midsummer’s day, three drops of blood would fall and anyone who caught the drops would “gain knowledge of all things” and could keep the devil at bay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c08c7bf28d695501875d9692e9df27d2809cb492\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08c7bf28d695501875d9692e9df27d2809cb492/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spirits soar … a portrait of an anonymous African, remade on black polka dot fabric.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spirits soar … a portrait of an anonymous African, remade on black polka dot fabric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Ingrid Pollard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This poetic resonance in the title also points to the way that imagination, in Pollard’s latest work, emerges as the substance that holds so many disparate elements together, transfiguring and transforming. Where a younger Pollard’s sometimes harsh, often ironic, juxtaposition of images or text and image, might lead us headlong into a chasm of contradiction that can be discerned in the heart of Englishness and England’s cultural mythology, here she emerges as a master of synthesis and humanism. She draws out the invisible threads that connect landscapes and histories and establishes a sense of liberated being that moves freely within space and time.</p> <p>Anonymous portraits of Africans, for example, are rescued from the pages of antiquarian books. While once these images may have spoken, through Pollard, to the violence of black voices erased by the colonial archive, here they are recast on black fabric patterned with white polka dots and become the centre of a visual dance that stimulates the eye and makes the spirit soar. An experience of transcendence is conveyed, bearing out Pollard’s own claim, in a text that accompanies the exhibition (drawing on a conversation with Sussex professor Divya P Tolia-Kelly), that this is “the most kind of dreamy piece of work” she’s ever done. Like a dream, it renders things forgotten and unseen and it lands with a sense of sublime restitution.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.thelmahulbert.com/?q=exhibitions\">Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood is at Thelma Hulbert Gallery, Honiton, until 29 October</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

                    "bodyText": "With the opening of her survey show, Carbon Slowly Turning, at MK Gallery in March (now running at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 25 September), 2022 had already shaped up as a major year in the career of photographer and visual artist Ingrid Pollard. Then in April she was nominated for the Turner prize, commended by a jury “struck by bold new developments” in her recent work as well as for the way she has “for decades […] uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight”. In works ranging from The Cost of the English Landscape (1989), which connected romantic visions of the Lake District with references to the slave trade and nuclear power production at Sellafield, to Landscape Trauma (2001), where the geological structures of Northumbrian rock formations are writ large on vast photographic panels, Pollard has, for more than 40 years, reflected the inadequacy of simplistic narratives about England’s landscape and in contrast offered an artistic vision of engagement with the natural world that grasps, above all, its movement and complexity. A new series of kinetic sculptures will, in this vein, crown her contribution to the Turner prize exhibition that opens at Tate Liverpool in October. Until then, perhaps the best evidence around that here is an artist who, at 69, is only now coming into the peak of her creative powers, is to be found off the beaten track, at the Thelma Hulbert Gallery in Honiton, east Devon, where a new solo show, Three Drops of Blood, brings together Pollard’s recent engagement with 19th-century botanical collections and East Devon’s history as a former world centre of lace-manufacturing with her own enduring concern with questions of race and the legacies of empire. Curated by Devon-based Talking on Corners (AKA Ella S Mills, whose art historical research has focused on female figures of the British Black Arts Movements including Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson), the exhibition marks the culmination of two years’ research by Pollard across the county including at the Devon and Exeter Institution where, among other details, she unearthed folk histories of the fern. This element runs through the show connecting perfect reproductions of xylotheks – wooden boxes used for storing tree specimens – and classification-photography, with contemporary reflections by the Antiguan American writer Jamaica Kincaid on communing with people and plants in the Himalayas, and of ways other than colonial adventure of being in the world. The fern, it transpires, is part of our ancient landscape, dating back more than 300m years, and predating even the advent of dinosaurs, to the Carboniferous period. Its reproduction was for centuries a mystery – no flowers or pods – inspiring beliefs of magical agency. It was said, for example, that anyone who held invisible fern seeds would be invisible too, and that by shooting them into the sun with an arrow on midsummer’s day, three drops of blood would fall and anyone who caught the drops would “gain knowledge of all things” and could keep the devil at bay. This poetic resonance in the title also points to the way that imagination, in Pollard’s latest work, emerges as the substance that holds so many disparate elements together, transfiguring and transforming. Where a younger Pollard’s sometimes harsh, often ironic, juxtaposition of images or text and image, might lead us headlong into a chasm of contradiction that can be discerned in the heart of Englishness and England’s cultural mythology, here she emerges as a master of synthesis and humanism. She draws out the invisible threads that connect landscapes and histories and establishes a sense of liberated being that moves freely within space and time. Anonymous portraits of Africans, for example, are rescued from the pages of antiquarian books. While once these images may have spoken, through Pollard, to the violence of black voices erased by the colonial archive, here they are recast on black fabric patterned with white polka dots and become the centre of a visual dance that stimulates the eye and makes the spirit soar. An experience of transcendence is conveyed, bearing out Pollard’s own claim, in a text that accompanies the exhibition (drawing on a conversation with Sussex professor Divya P Tolia-Kelly), that this is “the most kind of dreamy piece of work” she’s ever done. Like a dream, it renders things forgotten and unseen and it lands with a sense of sublime restitution. Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood is at Thelma Hulbert Gallery, Honiton, until 29 October.",

The ‘electricity penalty shootout’ The country’s electricity supply industry is a complex jigsaw puzzle designed to encourage the generation of everything from wind, solar and nuclear power to biomass and gas-fired. Underpinning this is the “balancing market”, operated in effect by National Grid, which relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Last winter, the network operator tripled its spend on balancing the grid to £1.5bn. The system is designed to prioritise renewable electricity ahead of nuclear, coal and gas. The electricity price in every half-hour period is set by the marginal cost of the last generating unit to be turned off to meet demand – usually gas-fired plants, which have the highest costs. While gas prices were low, there were few objections to this system, but the energy crisis has triggered repeated calls for gas and electricity pricing to be delinked. The supplier Good Energy draws the analogy with a penalty shootout in football: the best players (renewables) are selected first “but it’s the individual who steps up last who has the final say, deciding the fate of the result” – in this case, the cost. Gas-fired power still plays a significant role in Britain’s electricity makeup, accounting for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power and well ahead of a record 25.6% for wind. If peaking plants are used regularly, their role could be seen more as “baseload” than backup power. There are concerns about the tactics used by some generators. The energy regulator Ofgem said in November that last winter some generators had declared their plants unavailable to the grid, before later offering power at much higher prices. In 2020, Ofgem required InterGen to pay £37m after concluding that it “sent misleading signals to National Grid in 2016 about how much energy it would supply during peak winter hours to make a substantial profit”. The regulator found InterGen made £12.8m through “manipulation of the market”. At the time, the company said: “We deeply regret and sincerely apologise for the behaviour of former traders.” VPI said any suggestion it had made excessive profits was “not accurate” and that it operated “within the rules of the energy market”. It said peaking plants operated “less frequently, with costs to generate and pricing dependent on market conditions”. A spokesperson added: “VPI has invested to almost triple its generation capacity in the last two years and revenue has grown as a result.” Left out from the levy When Hunt extended the windfall tax last year from oil and gas producers to the excess profits from nuclear, solar and wind, he exempted gas peaking plants, warning of “unintended impacts” amid fears European gas supplies could fall short of demand, leading to blackouts. ScottishPower’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, condemned the decision. “The crisis has been made by gas and paid for by renewables,” he said, adding that it was “strange” for government to “cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave gas generation untouched”. But Tom Glover, the UK country chair of RWE, which owns several gas-fired stations, said they could go for many years without making enough profit. “It’s important that when prices improve and allow them to make higher returns they are able to keep that profit so that they are incentivised to keep these power stations open during lower priced periods.

Before that, authorities will have to decide whether to act or to stomach peaking plants making significant – if unpredictable – profits.",

But these ended at the end of 2012 and were replaced by other schemes, including a loan system that had low take-up.</p> <p>The analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit suggests insulation rates subsequently fell by 92%. An additional 9 million households would be likely to have benefited from the energy-saving measures had they continued at pre-2012 levels.</p> <p>Labour has pledged £60bn of public investment to bring all homes up to the energy performance certificate (EPC) band C rating over 10 years, claiming it would save each family £400 a year on their energy bills and cut national gas imports by up to 15%. The average E-rated home is set to require an additional £320 a year for energy bills compared with a C-rated property.</p> <p>“The chancellor’s disastrous spring statement is unraveling because he failed to tackle the cost of living crisis that working people face,” Miliband said. “The government’s energy relaunch will have no credibility unless it finally delivers on energy efficiency – the best, most effective way to reduce energy bills, cut our demand for fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.”</p> <p>Sunak is expected to come under fire at the Treasury select committee hearing on Monday after a furious response to the spring statement, widely seen as not doing enough to ease the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Johnson is expected to try to reconcile senior cabinet ministers this week amid fallout from the spring statement, and to resolve tensions over the energy strategy.</p> <p>A government source confirmed <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunak-plans-further-council-tax-rebate-after-backlash-to-spring-statement-3v2pwdngf\">reports in the Sunday Times</a> that Downing Street was looking at preliminary proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – and it could rise to about £2,500 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Zahawi hinted that the government could do more to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think he [Rishi Sunak, the chancellor] will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.”</p> <p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year.</p> <p>“Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” Ashworth said. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years, that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.”</p> <p>As well as a major expansion in energy efficiency measures, Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/labour-proposes-windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-and-gas-to-reduce-bills\">windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies</a>, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Millions of households are paying an extra £170 in bills because of cuts to subsidies for measures such as home insulation, according to analysis that comes during an impasse on the government’s energy strategy. One cabinet source said it was now likely the strategy – designed to tackle rising bills and boost energy security – would not be ready this week, amid cabinet splits over funding for nuclear power and the relaxing of planning rules concerning onshore wind. On Sunday one cabinet minister suggested the government was looking seriously at schemes to offer homeowners discounts on energy if they live near new windfarms or nuclear plants. “We’ve seen great examples of other people where if they build a nuclear power station, within a certain radius of that power station they get free power,” said the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi. Campaigners have said the strategy should include further measures to make homes more energy efficient, on top of the announcement last week that VAT would be cut on materials used for measures such as the installation of solar panels and heat pumps. Analysis highlighted by Labour found a fall in home insulation rates since 2012, when many subsidies were cut, meaning that at least 9 million households were now paying £170 a year more in electricity bills. The party has called for a national homes insulation programme, which the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said would reduce energy consumption enough to nullify the amount of gas imported from Russia. Installations averaged 40,000 a month in 2012 under the previous government’s insulation programmes, the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and the community energy saving programme (CESP). But these ended at the end of 2012 and were replaced by other schemes, including a loan system that had low take-up. The analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit suggests insulation rates subsequently fell by 92%. An additional 9 million households would be likely to have benefited from the energy-saving measures had they continued at pre-2012 levels. Labour has pledged £60bn of public investment to bring all homes up to the energy performance certificate (EPC) band C rating over 10 years, claiming it would save each family £400 a year on their energy bills and cut national gas imports by up to 15%. The average E-rated home is set to require an additional £320 a year for energy bills compared with a C-rated property. “The chancellor’s disastrous spring statement is unraveling because he failed to tackle the cost of living crisis that working people face,” Miliband said. “The government’s energy relaunch will have no credibility unless it finally delivers on energy efficiency – the best, most effective way to reduce energy bills, cut our demand for fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.” Sunak is expected to come under fire at the Treasury select committee hearing on Monday after a furious response to the spring statement, widely seen as not doing enough to ease the cost of living crisis. Johnson is expected to try to reconcile senior cabinet ministers this week amid fallout from the spring statement, and to resolve tensions over the energy strategy. A government source confirmed reports in the Sunday Times that Downing Street was looking at preliminary proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – and it could rise to about £2,500 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill. Meanwhile, Zahawi hinted that the government could do more to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think he [Rishi Sunak, the chancellor] will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year. “Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” Ashworth said. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years, that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.” As well as a major expansion in energy efficiency measures, Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April.",

The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside. </em><br></p> \n   <p><em>The chance of a [radioactive] release from this sort of reactor is a lot lower. </em><br></p> \n   <p><em>These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they got a passive system, they’ve got high pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems. </em><br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The passive cooling systems work in the absence of electricity supply or diesel generators, Irwin said. </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Ultimately if they disabled all the outside supplies [of electricity] and all the diesel generators, eventually there won’t be enough cooling and you’ll melt the core. But I think we’re a long way off from that at the moment. </em></p> \n   <p>Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A shutdown of the Zaporizhzhya plant would lead to a “severe loss of power in Ukraine”, he said.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-622185478f08c1dd5f65aa46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T03:22:35.256Z\">3.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A fire is reportedly still burning in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services.</p> \n  <p>Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant appeared on Telegram earlier in the morning around 3am local time, saying: “There is a real threat of a nuclear danger at the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe.

Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60571884\">Aleppo in Syria</a>, today amount to war crimes.</p> \n  <p>Russian soldiers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/constant-shelling-as-russian-forces-lay-siege-to-key-ukrainian-cities-kyiv-mariupol\">threatening</a> to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lseih/2020/07/01/there-is-no-ukraine-fact-checking-the-kremlins-version-of-ukrainian-history/\">the mother of Russian cities</a>”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-interview/20220303-war-in-ukraine-if-civilians-are-directly-targeted-that-is-a-crime-icc-prosecutor-says\">Hague</a> where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents.</p> \n  <p>The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion?page=with:block-6220e8b88f08c1dd5f65a17b#block-6220e8b88f08c1dd5f65a17b\">Chernihiv</a> region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/03/02/video-shows-crying-russian-soldier-drinking-tea-calling-mom/\">hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts</a>.

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means, in the French president’s words, “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine, saying Moscow was aiming to take “full control” by diplomatic or military means, according to the Elysée.</strong></p> \n  <p>As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said.</p> \n  <p>Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term.</p> \n  <p>“There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”.</p> \n  <p>“‘You are lying to yourself,’” Macron told Putin, the official said. “‘It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.’” </p> \n  <p>• This post was amended on 3 March 2022. An earlier version mistakenly attributed the words “the worst is still to come” to Vladimir Putin, rather than Emmanuel Macron. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ead3d94be2ae8e6d4e4dc1613e598ef9298f5f42\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead3d94be2ae8e6d4e4dc1613e598ef9298f5f42/0_160_4804_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-03T17:20:12.074Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6220c9f38f08c1dd5f659f87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-03T14:02:41.155Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ukrainian negotiators arrive for talks with Russian side in Belarus, says Russian news agency</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukrainian negotiators have arrived by helicopter for talks with the Russian side in Belarus, the Russian state news agency TASS said.</strong></p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, Belarus’s foreign ministry posted a photo of a conference room, saying it had been set up to host a second round of talks.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BelarusMFA/status/1499054479529943040\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">⚡️🇷🇺🇧🇾🇺🇦“Hunter’s house” is ready to host second round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations <a href=\"https://t.co/RkPVHBbAEF\">pic.twitter.com/RkPVHBbAEF</a></p>— Belarus MFA 🇧🇾 (@BelarusMFA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelarusMFA/status/1499054479529943040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-03T14:09:40.246Z\">at 2.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6220c5c68f088d6b798dbc54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-03T13:43:52.852Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15dd125bfc0b3649022d7c083f7156866939af4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15dd125bfc0b3649022d7c083f7156866939af4/0_65_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke rises from damaged civil settlements after Russian attacks in Chernihiv, Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke rises from damaged civil settlements after Russian attacks in Chernihiv, Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6abba1c6e9ffbe27260db872237cc7c57564feab\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6abba1c6e9ffbe27260db872237cc7c57564feab/0_47_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At least nine people have been killed and four wounded after a Russian airstrike hit two schools and private houses in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Thursday, governor Viacheslav Chaus said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At least nine people have been killed and four wounded after a Russian airstrike hit two schools and private houses in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Thursday, governor Viacheslav Chaus said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6220c45b8f0851056ae56e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lizzydavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-03T13:38:03.033Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>You may have seen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olex_scherba/status/1497953787079712774?s=20&amp;t=CtPoVTF0_Nv1uzYVYSoCfg\">a video</a> on social media last week of a Ukrainian man removing a landmine with his bare hands, the cigarette dangling from his mouth reinforcing his apparent nonchalance. </p> \n  <p><strong>While his bravery was applauded, experts are worried about the message this and other similar videos send,</strong> Lizzy Davies writes.

It is 7.27am in Ukraine as Russia’s war on its neighbour enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis stands: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. An employee at the plant said Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. No casualties have so far been reported. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished. There are no victims.” Home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. The mayor of Enerhodar, a town located about 150km south-east of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said fighting at the plant has stopped, according to BBC Ukrainian, citing a local broadcaster. The news comes after the plant reportedly sustained several hours of heavy shelling and a fire which broke out on the third, fourth and fifth floor of a building at the complex, according to Ukrainian emergency officials. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been localised just before 6am local time. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 05:55 a fire in the training building (size 60x40 m) of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Enerhodar was localised on an area of 2 thousand square meters.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it has puts its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. IAEA director general, Rafael Gross, added he was “deeply concerned” with the situation and had spoken with Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmygal to monitor and stay in close contact with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator and operator. https://twitter.com/rafaelmgrossi/status/1499595087432626176?s=20&amp;t=UvSEC6j6NoH1WTvVJ9ZfTg Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has also confirmed he has spoken with Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy about the “horrific attacks “at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” Trudeau said. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed rescue teams are currently on the site of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to extinguish the fire which started earlier in the morning in the training building. Earlier, the agency said Russian troops has prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. However, in an update published to its official Telegram account just after 5.30am local time, the service said as of 5.20am, SES units had been deployed to put out the fire in the training building. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukrainian emergency services are saying Russian troops are preventing them from extinguishing a fire that continues to burn at a nuclear power plant after it was struck by shelling. In an update published to its official Telegram account at 4am local time, the State Emergency Services said: The occupiers do not allow the SES units [Ukrainian public rescue teams] to start eliminating the consequences of the fire.” The agency said that one of the buildings of the plant’s training complex “continues to burn”, adding that “the fire covered 3, 4, 5 floors of a five-storey building.” Corroborating an early analysis from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, reporter Donna Lu brings us another perspective from Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. According to Iwin, the chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release from the Zaporizhzhya power plant are low. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the largest in Europe, contains six 950 megawatt pressurised water nuclear (PWR) reactors. Irwin said the PWR reactors are “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors. The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside. The chance of a [radioactive] release from this sort of reactor is a lot lower. These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they got a passive system, they’ve got high pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems. The passive cooling systems work in the absence of electricity supply or diesel generators, Irwin said. “Ultimately if they disabled all the outside supplies [of electricity] and all the diesel generators, eventually there won’t be enough cooling and you’ll melt the core. But I think we’re a long way off from that at the moment. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. A shutdown of the Zaporizhzhya plant would lead to a “severe loss of power in Ukraine”, he said. A fire is reportedly still burning in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services. Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant appeared on Telegram earlier in the morning around 3am local time, saying: “There is a real threat of a nuclear danger at the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire at the energy blocks of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.” Video footage of the fire - which broke out early in the morning on Friday - can be viewed below. Here is an analysis on the significance of the nuclear power plant attack from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Juian Borger. The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. But nuclear safety experts warned that any interruption to the power supply that affects the cooling system could start a chain of events that could lead to disaster, as could a direct hit on the spent fuel pools which are not as well protected as the reactors. “If the building is not damaged and if the reactors entered safe shut down, and have secondary or tertiary cooling systems then there should be little risk. If those conditions are not met, there is a significant risk,” Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council, said on Twitter. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Read the full story below. British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Our diplomatic editor has more on the call between Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the wake of the nuclear plant fire: Authorities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant say the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” after Russian military shelling starts fire, Agence France-Presse reports. US President Joe Biden has just spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the White House continues to monitor the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. According to readout of the call published by the White House Press Office, Biden joined Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allowing firefighters and emergency responders to access the site. Biden also spoke with under secretary for nuclear security of the US Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to receive an update on the situation at the plant. Andrey Tuz, spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said shelling has stopped for the time being, but the situation is extremely uncertain. Speaking to the BBC Russian Service, he said: They bombed everything they could, including blocks and everything else. Now the information is being clarified, it’s hard to say everything. [To the station] a white car, representatives of the Russian military, has left. It’s flashing with its headlights. Now it’s being determined whether they will be approached for negotiations, or how to proceed further.” A series of photos from the air and on the ground provide some more context as to the location and significance of the recent Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fire. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service is reporting that radiation and fire safety conditions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “within normal limits”. An update on the agency’s official Telegram account reads: As of 02:26 in the city of Energodar at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the third power unit was disconnected from the unified energy system (only Unit 4 is operating). Of the six power units, one is currently operating. Radiation and fire safety conditions at nuclear power plants are within normal limits. Fire condition at the NPP is normal.” The agency said a fire broke out in the training building outside the NPP, however the Guardian has been unable to verify these claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Ukraine regulator told the agency there has been “no change” reported in radiation levels at the plant. Here’s exactly where the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine took place early on Friday morning. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says they are aware of reports of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and are in contact with Ukrainian authorities. According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). Director general Rafael Mariano Grossi appealed for an immediate halt to the use of force at Enerhodar and called on the military forces operating there to refrain from violence near the nuclear power plant. He added the IAEA continues to consult with Ukraine and others with a view to provide “maximum possible assistance to the country” as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security. The Guardian’s Julian Borger has spoken to Mariana Budjeryn, an Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center. Budjeryn said: Saying that a reactor building is hit doesn’t tell us much, because the most vulnerable [part of] this is the electricity and water supply. If the electricity is taken out, the back up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode. If the core explodes, there’s hope that the confinement chamber will capture the radiation from release into the environment. Confinement chambers are designed with withstand some level of impact even bombing. But of course we don’t know how they will stand to this intensity of shelling BUT spent fuel pools - the fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed - so less active but more tightly packed material, also dangerous for going critical if the cooling system fails. And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers. We learned about how vulnerable spent fuel pools are during Fukushima The backup generators failed and the water pumping system failed - it was lucky that ocean water flooded those and the reactor cores to provide cooling.” Alphabet Inc’s Google has said is has stopped selling online advertising in Russia, a ban that covers search, YouTube and outside publishing partners, Reuters reports. The move by the world’s top seller of online ads by revenue follows similar pauses in Russia by smaller internet companies Twitter Inc and Snap Inc. Ukraine’s foreign minister is now confirming reports of a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning an explosion could have devastating consequences. In a tweet issued just after 2.30am local time, Dmytro Kuleba said: Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” A fire has broken out in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to an announcement from plant employees and the mayor of the nearby town of Enerhodar. “As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel just after 1.30am local time, citing what he called a threat to world security. Orlov recorded a short video message which has now been shared my multiple local Ukrainian media outlets, urging Russian troops to immediately stop shelling the plant. The official earlier said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts and reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday. According to a Telegram message posted by an employee at the plant, Russian troops fired at the nuclear facility. Attention! Equipment of the Russian Federation is firing at the Zaporozhye NPP. There is a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand a ceasefire from heavy equipment at the Zaporozhye NPP! As of 2.30am local time, the employee added that firefighters have been unable to reach the scene of the fire, claiming the outbreak was a result of shots by Russian troops. Ukrainian news agencies UNIAN and Hromadske also report that a fire has started at the nuclear power plant. It remains unclear exactly where the fire is located within the plant or the damage inflicted so far. The city on the Dnieper River accounts for one-quarter of the country’s power generation. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com The UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace has told the BBC that Russia’s military strategy is not going to plan. Wallace said logistics recovered from armoured vehicles show the Russian army is behind schedule - and that plans to appeal to Ukrainians as “liberators” have failed. President Putin on the other hand has insisted Russia’s invasion is “going to plan” in a televised address on Thursday. It is 1:30am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east was Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces. At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihivon Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say. The death toll across Ukraine is continuing to rise. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. – Leonie Chao-Fong, Maanvi Singh According to GlobalCheck, a service that tracks Internet censorship in the CIS countries, the BBC is now blocked in Russia, as is Deutsche Welle: This comes after the EU blocked content from Russian state-backed RT and Sputnik. The UK, fearing an outright ban could lead to reciprocal action by Moscow against the BBC, instead asked Ofcom to monitor and investigate RT’s output. But the EU sanction de facto got RT off UK airwaves, because Sky received its RT broadcasts from Luxembourg. The Biden administration will allow Ukrainians in the US Temporary Protected Status, a designation that will them to continue living and working in the country for 18 months. Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the news today: Some 75,000 Ukrainians in the US will be eligible to apply. The move comes after immigrant advocates pushed for the US to quickly accommodate Ukranians already in the US as Russian began bombarding their home country. But the US has yet to extend similar protections for tens of thousands of Afghans in US prior to and following the chaotic evacuation last summer. Emmanuel Akinwotu, Julian Borger and Lisa O’Carroll report: More than 500 international students are trapped in Sumy, a town 40km from Ukraine’s northeast border that has been battered by days of shelling by Russian forces. Most of the students are Nigerian, while others are from Ghana, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ireland, India, Lebanon and Turkey. They have all suddenly found themselves stranded in a war zone. Trains and buses have stopped running; roads and bridges out of the city have been destroyed and fighting has been reported in the city’s streets. The students have remained in five hostel buildings since the Russian invasion began last week, after advice from their university to stay behind – even as many Ukrainian students fled. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student who arrived in Sumy in January, said that food and water supplies were already running low and it was no longer safe to head to local stores. “We are hearing blasts every day. We have to run into our bunkers each time. Yesterday we heard the blasts at six or seven in the morning. When we hear them, we run to the basement – that’s our makeshift bunker,” he said, speaking by telephone late on Wednesday. “We are running out of food, we’re running out of water. What we have now is mainly soda water,” Adefemi said. While the conflict has so far mainly focused on the outskirts of the city, fears are rising that troops may soon enter the city. Read more: The fall of the first Ukrainian city to the Russian army bodes ill for the rest of the country. Russian forces, reports suggest, surrounded and starved the southern Dnieper River port of Kherson into submission. Kherson’s mayor told reporters that many citizens had been left dead and unrecognisable by high-calibre weapons used by the Russians to bombard his city. Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for Aleppo in Syria, today amount to war crimes. Russian soldiers are threatening to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “the mother of Russian cities”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The Hague where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents. The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the Chernihiv region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts. Forcing poor young men to fight in an illegal war ought to be added to the list of charges Mr Putin might face. Read more: Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has released a message to Ukrainians, saying that the Netherlands stands with them. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has accused Russia of staging humanitarian aid as troops advance of Kherson, a strategically important Black Sea port. And Lyubov Sobol, a member of the Russian Opposition Coordination Council, is echoing him. In justifying its war, Russia is investing a lot of time and effort in propaganda aimed at both Russians and Ukrainians. My Guardian colleagues reported earlier: US officials claim they have evidence of a Russian plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for an invasion. The alleged plot would involve using corpses, footage of blown-up buildings, fake Ukrainian military hardware, Turkish-made drones and actors playing the part of Russian-speaking mourners. “We don’t know definitively that this is the route they are going to take, but we know that this is an option under consideration,” the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told MSNBC, adding that the video “would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves”. Finer added: “That would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed, of people purportedly killed in an incident like this.” The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said the video would have purported to show a Ukrainian attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine and would be “very graphic”. He added that the US believed that the plan had the backing of the Kremlin. “Our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Kirby said. Sobol tweeted that a fake pro-Putin rally is being organized by Russian troops in Kherson. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. The line would allow US and Russian forces to avoid crossing paths along the Polish border and the Black Sea, for example, while Russia advances on ukraine. The US and Russia had set up a similar line of communication in the Syrian conflict after Russia began military action there. A week after invasion of Ukraine launched, ICC confirms it is gathering evidence of possible war crimes. Here’s what we know so far, from the Guardian’s Jon Henley and Samantha Lock: Earlier today, Poland warned its citizens to leave Russia and Belarus due to ongoing fighting in Ukraine, reported Reuters: The Polish foreign ministry said on Thursday Polish citizens should leave Russia and Belarus due to the situation in Ukraine. “We recommend Polish citizens staying on the territory of the Russian Federation should leave its territory using available commercial and private transport,” it said, adding travel options were limited due to flights between the two countries being suspended. It issued a similar recommendation regarding Belarus, adding: “In the event of a drastic deterioration of the security situation, a closure of borders or other unforeseen situations, evacuation may turn out to be considerably difficult or even impossible.” Ukrainian atomic energy authorities have posted video online showing tracer fire at Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, Zaporizhzhya. Here’s the video that was posted to Youtube: The Guardian’s Julian Borger wrote today about concerns from UN officials as Russian forces claimed that they had surrounded the nuclear plant: The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”.

Earlier today, US prosecutors charged a Russian television producer and described oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, with violating sanctions related to Crimea, reported Reuters: U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged a television producer for Konstantin Malofeyev, described as a Russian oligarch, with violating Crimea-related sanctions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York said on Thursday. John Hanick, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in February in London and the United States is seeking his extradition. Prosecutors said Hanick was charged with violating U.S. sanctions arising from Russia’s 2014 invasion of the Crimean peninsula. Malofeyev is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. Amnesty International has criticised the EU decision to limit its Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), which will grant immediate protection in EU countries to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, to Ukrainian nationals. On Thursday, EU member states watered down a proposal from the European commission that would have seen all long term residents given the protection. Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s EU office said: “Everybody fleeing conflict must be provided with protection and help to establish themselves and we welcome that Ukrainians will be swiftly protected. But by restricting that assistance principally to Ukrainians fleeing conflict, the Council has also exposed the limitations of Europe’s solidarity. “Today’s decision means that Ukrainians seeking safety in the EU will quickly get residence permits, be able to work, and be provided with suitable accommodation, welfare assistance, medical assistance, and education. It is now up to member states to decide if they will extend that to others fleeing Ukraine. We call on them to treat everyone fleeing this conflict equally. “The Council’s decision today is a reminder that Europe has long had the tools to protect people fleeing war and help new arrivals, and the usual ‘Fortress Europe’ approach is a politically motivated choice. That this is happening for the first time but principally for displaced Ukrainian nationals shows that the EU’s approach is riddled with double standards.” This just in: RT America, apart of the global RT network that is funded by the Russian government, is stopping production and laying off most of its staff, reports CNN’s Oliver Darcy: The production company behind the American version of the Russian state-funded network RT laid off most of its staff on Thursday, according to a memo obtained by CNN. Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&amp;R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&amp;R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees. The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network. This story is still developing. Read the article here. The UK culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has written to TikTok, Twitter and Meta (the owner of Facebook and Instagram) asking them to block the online output of Kremlin-backed news services Russia Today and Sputnik. Writing to the platforms’ UK heads, she said: “I want to urge you to do everything you can to apply the approach you are taking across the EU to block access both to RT and to Sputnik’s online output (including the latter’s radio and audio services) on your UK services.” RT and Sputnik have already been blocked the platforms across the EU, while RT has already lost its Sky slot. The Guardian has approached TikTok, Meta and Twitter for comment. In a Twitter post, French president Emmanuel Macron said that during a conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin this morning, Putin again refused to stop attacks against Ukraine. “I spoke to President Putin this morning. He refuses to stop his attacks on Ukraine at this point,” tweeted Macron. “It is vital to maintain dialogue to avoid human tragedy.” Macron said that he will continue communicating with Putin, adding that, “We must avoid the worst.” In a separate post, Macron continued: “Maintaining dialogue to protect the people, obtaining measures that will avoid human tragedy, putting an end to this war: this is the purpose of my commitment alongside President Zelensky and the international community,” ending his tweet by saying, “I am and will remain fully determined.” This just in: Ukraine and Russia have agreed to temporary, local ceasefires to allow the evacuation of civilians as well as aid deliveries via safe corridors. But some experts have warned that the creation of said “humanitarian corridors” and the backed ceasefires could be an opportunity for Russia to strategically resupply and regroup. More analysis on how Russia may use the ceasefire periods from Emma Beals, a senior adviser at the European Institute of Peace: Following up on newly announced sanctions against billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov by the UK, here’s a statement posted to Twitter from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on the additional penalties: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs. These associates of Putin are now cut off from their significant interests in UK. It is 9.18pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east appeared to be Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, where Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces. At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihiv on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say, with the death toll continuing to rise. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. More on the US’s announcement of additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs... Here is an excerpt from the national security council fact sheet announcing the sanctions, with more context behind the additional penalties: Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine... These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The Department of Treasury will share financial intelligence and other evidence where appropriate with the Department of Justice to support criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets. Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s cronies and their family members. One of the elites is Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by U.S. persons – including his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft. The United States will also sanction Dmitry Peskov, who as Putin’s spokesman is a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda. The United States will also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates. As President Biden said, [we] will continue to work with our Allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who are profiting from this violent regime. The United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains. The US will be issuing additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs, including the billionaire Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, the White House said today. Here is a list of who will be targeted in this newly announced round, according to a fact sheet provided by a spokesperson with the national security council: Nikolai Tokarev (his wife, Galina, daughter Mayya, and his two luxury real estate companies) Boris Rotenberg (his wife, Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris) Arkady Rotenberg (his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya) Sergei Chemezov (his wife, Yekaterina, his son Stanislav, and stepdaughter Anastasiya) Igor Shuvalov (his five companies, his wife, Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company) Yevgeniy Prigozhin (his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel) Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s press secretary Alisher Usmanov (his superyacht, one of the world’s largest and just seized by Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately owned aircraft) The US will also be placing visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 “family members and close associates”. The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has sanctioned the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. Drone footage shows devastated town near Kyiv Drone footage shows debris and destroyed buildings as well as burnt-out Russian military vehicles in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv. Smoke can be seen pouring out of a residential building destroyed by the shelling and several houses appear to be heavily damaged in the fight as well as Russian military vehicles. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been updated to 33, the Ukrainian emergency services said. At least 33 bodies have been recovered from rubble in the wake of airstrikes by Russian forces on Chernihiv, it said in an online post. The previous estimate was 22. Rescue work has been temporarily suspended due to heavy shelling in the area, it said. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, negotiators on both sides said. In the aftermath of the talks that took place on the Poland-Belarus border, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for. But Podolyak said both sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians. That is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation. Both sides also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. Without elaborating, Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. On the Russian side, Russia’s main negotiator and former culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, said: The main question that we decided on today was the issue of saving people, civilians, who are in the zone of military clashes. Russia calls on civilians who find themselves in this situation, if military actions continue, to use these humanitarian corridors. Another Russian negotiator, the nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, said the agreements will be “implemented in the near future”. Today’s talks mark the first time Ukraine and Russia have agreed to any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Here’s a bit more on Vladimir Putin’s speech this afternoon, where the Russian leader claimed military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. Putin’s televised comments appeared designed to rebut statements by western governments and intelligence agencies that the Russian advance has faltered in the face of logistical problems, tactical mistakes and fiercer-than-expected resistance from Ukraine. I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in line with the timetable. According to plan. All the tasks that have been set are being successfully resolved. He went on to give a number of examples of Russian soldiers’ “heroic” actions and said the families of Russian soldiers who had been killed during the fighting would be compensated. Now on Ukrainian territory, our soldiers and officers are fighting for Russia, for a peaceful life for the citizens of Donbas, for the denazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine, so that we can’t be threatened by an anti-Russia right on our borders that the west has been creating for years. A missile appeared to hit a residential building in central Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, in footage captured on dashcam. The state emergency service of Ukraine said an oil depot in Chernihiv was also on fire after being hit by a shell. Interpol has rebuffed Ukraine’s request to exclude Russia from its organisation, despite backing from both Britain and Poland who requested Russia’s suspension. A spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat told the Guardian: Only the general assembly, Interpol’s supreme governing body comprising representatives from each of its 195 member countries, can vote on issues relating to membership. The Interpol general secretariat continues to monitor the situation concerning Ukraine closely. The International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, is a supranational body providing investigational support to member states, primarily through its red notice system that flags suspects internationally. Continuing to include Russia within Interpol grants security services access to the red notice database and potential broader support, despite accusations that Russia is a major abuser of the red notice system. Rights groups point to the ability of authoritarian regimes to abuse Interpol’s red notice system in order to flag political dissidents or exiles. Critics also point to the opacity of Interpol’s internal affairs, including allowing Syria to rejoin the organisation last year after a decade-long suspension. Ukraine’s minister for internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky, wrote to Interpol earlier this week demanding Russia’s expulsion following its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,” he wrote, according to the Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske. Britain and Poland both backed Ukraine’s efforts, although they demanded that Interpol suspend Russia rather than exclude it. The British home secretary, Priti Patel, told parliament: The Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect. Poland’s police chief, Gen Jaroslaw Szymczyk wrote an impassioned personal letter to Interpol’s general secretary, Jürgen Stock. I strongly believe that the world needs a clear, consistent and unambiguous message that we, police officers from all over the world, do not accept the warfare actions taken by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Dear Jürgen. We have known each other for many years. We have talked many times about our dream of a safer world, the need to protect victims and to definitely prosecute those who stand on the other side of the law and the good. This is a great responsibility. Today, dear friend, the world is telling us “I call”. It is time to turn words into actions.” In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat said the organisation remained committed to ensuring that red notice requests from member states adhered to the organisations’ rules. In a Telegram group chat organised in answer to Ukraine’s government call for hackers to protect the country’s infrastructure from cyber-attacks and to conduct its own cyber missions, a hacking team called the Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it planned to target the Belarusian railway network, the news service reports. Belarus has been a critical staging point for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the country’s railway network being used to transport Russian soldiers, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans told Reuters. The “IT army” group chat also discussed targeting Russian telecom companies as well as Glonass – Russia’s satellite-based navigation system and alternative to GPS. “We need to mobilise and intensify our efforts as much as possible,” one post in the Telegram chat read. More than 237,000 people joined the Telegram channel in the days after Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, put out a call for the country’s hackers to join the cyberwar against Russia. “There will be tasks for everyone,” Fedorov tweeted. “We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.” A leader of Ukraine’s Muslim community, Sheikh Said Ismagilov, made an address to Russian Muslims serving as soldiers, asking: “Why did you come to kill us?” He said Ukraine does not need “saving” - as per Vladimir Putin’s rationale for his invasion - and asked Muslims around the world to support Ukraine’s fight for survival. Ukraine and Russia have agreed to hold a third round of talks soon, Reuters cites a Ukrainian negotiator as saying. The official said Ukraine did not receive the results it had counted on, but that both sides had reached an understanding on a joint provision of humanitarian corridors for evacuating civilians. Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted this : Ukrainian officials are warning that hackers have broken into local government websites to spread false reports that Ukraine has capitulated and signed a peace treaty with Moscow, Reuters reports. An undisclosed number of official websites of “regional authorities and local governments” have been hijacked and used to spread “lies” about a deal to end the fighting, Ukraine’s state service of special communication and information protection said. The agency said “the enemy” was responsible for the hacking spree. It was not immediately clear which websites it was referring to. Europe has already received one million refugees from Ukraine in the week since the war began and will receive millions more, the European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, has said. She was speaking as EU interior ministers agreed on a temporary protection directive to grant Ukrainian nationals the right to live, work, and access healthcare, housing and education immediately for up to one year, without the need to go through lengthy asylum procedures. If the conflict continued, or refugees could return safely, that status could be extended for a further two years. It would not offer any such rights to people from elsewhere who were in Ukraine as temporary workers or students. The European commission’s original proposal was watered down in relation to “third country” nationals who have long-term residence in Ukraine: national asylum laws will apply to them. It is understood that Poland and Hungary were the most vocal in opposing the initial proposal. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment. Vladimir Putin has accused Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields”. In a live address, the president described Russian soldiers as “real heroes”, and though he admitted to having “lost a few small towns”, he insisted that Russia’s special military operation was going “according to plan”. The “success” of the Russian army in Ukraine was an example of that “heroism”, Putin claimed. He said Ukrainians and Russians were “one people” but that Ukrainians were “threatened and brainwashed”. Putin went on to claim that Russian troops were providing humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee – in direct contradiction of what Ukraine has said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president addressed Putin: We are not attacking Russia and we do not plan to attack it. What do you want from us? Leave our land. Referring to the Russian leader receiving world leaders at a now-famous enormously long table, Zelenskiy said: Sit down with me. Just not 30 metres away like with [the French president, Emmanuel Macron]. He also called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes! If we are no more, then God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next. Believe me. Russia has drawn up plans for public executions in Ukraine as and when cities are captured by Russian troops, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg cites a European intelligence official as saying that Moscow has drafted strategies to break morale in order to discourage Ukrainians from fighting back as cities fall under the Kremlin’s control. The official said Moscow plans to crack down on protest, detain opponents and potentially carry out public executions, the news agency writes. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has now reached 22, the Ukrainian emergency services said. The bodies of at least 22 civilians had been recovered from the rubble in the wake of Russian airstrikes, they said in an online post. Rescue work was ongoing, they added, but did not specify where exactly the attack took place. Earlier we reported that the governor of Chernihiv said at least nine people were killed and four wounded after the airstrike hit two schools and private houses. Local press said there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. Russian forces are closing in on two key nuclear power plants in the south of Ukraine, the acting head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said. Kotin said Ukraine still controls both plants including Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but Russian troops have advanced to within 21 miles of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the South Ukraine power plant. The mayor of Enerhoda, in which the Zaporizhzhia plant is located, said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops for control of the south-eastern city. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. Another adviser, Vadym Denysenko, described the situation as alarming. Russian forces took the Chernobyl plant last week. Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Kotin described Russia’s capture of the defunct nuclear power plant as “nuclear terrorism”. Six people have been rescued after a cargo ship sunk off the coast of Odesa due to an explosion, a senior Ukrainian official told Reuters. Earlier we reported the Estonian-owned cargo ship, Helt, had sunk this afternoon, with two crew members in a life raft at sea and four others unaccounted for, according to the shipping agency’s managing director. Victor Vyshniov, deputy head of Ukraine’s maritime administrator, has now said six crew members have been picked up by Ukraine’s rescue service. The six have been taken to hospital in nearby Chernomorsk due to being in cold water. Vyshniov provided no further details about the cause of the incident. While FMQs in the Scottish parliament this lunchtime has been dominated by domestic issues, there was inevitable discussion of the Ukraine crisis, Libby Brooks writes. On the subject of refugees, Nicola Sturgeon told the Holyrood chamber that there was a “moral, humanitarian obligation” to help those fleeing the war, adding that she wanted to “appeal directly to the prime minister to follow the example of the European Union and allow anyone fleeing the horror of Ukraine entry to the UK if they wish and deal with the paperwork later”. Sturgeon also pledged action on oligarchs in Scotland, after the Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer challenged her about Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin who has received hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of agricultural subsidies for his 1,210 hectare (3,000 acre) estate in Scotland. Sturgeon said there would be an immediate review of such schemes, adding: I have sought urgent advice on the maximum possible action the Scottish government can take against individuals or entities identifying as having close links with the Russian regime … including ending support from the public purse and freezing assets. She said her government was also writing to Scottish businesses encouraging them to review and sever links with Russia. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia have started, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has confirmed. Mykhaylo Podolyak said he and other officials had begun talks with Russian delegates in Belarus. The Ukrainian delegation’s agenda is to agree an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave frontline communities. A Canadian-Israeli ice hockey player has described his harrowing escape from Ukraine, as foreign athletes in both Ukraine and Russia face life-threatening decisions over whether to stay or go. Eliezer Sherbatov was with his team, HC Mariupol, of the Ukrainian Hockey League, in the Donetsk region last week preparing for a game against Kramatorsk when a bomb exploded outside their hotel. “At 5am, I’m sleeping and hear: ‘Boom!’ You never hear that strong of a sound,” Sherbatov told TSN. “And it starts shaking, everything is shaking. So, a couple of metres away, the war started.” Sherbatov said the team’s coach called a meeting at breakfast, where he explained: “Guys - the war has started. It’s unfortunate, but I would suggest you to stay put as a team. But if you choose to leave, it’s your decision.’” Ukraine’s parliament has approved a bill to allow the seizure of assets or property in Ukraine owned by Russia or Russian citizens. Under the law, the government can suggest assets for confiscation to the security council, which must then approve their transfer to state ownership, Reuters reported. An advance team left the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes in Ukraine, its top prosecutor told Reuters in an interview. Their departure came hours after the prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began on 24 February. “Yesterday I formulated a team and today they are moving to the region,” Khan said. “It’s an advanced team, comprised of investigators, lawyers, but also those with particular experience in operational planning.” Khan said his office would be examining possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide – the offences under the court’s jurisdiction – by all parties in the conflict. Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC, and Moscow does not recognise the court, which was established in 1997 by the Rome Statute and opened in The Hague in 2002. Though not a member of the ICC, Ukraine signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onwards regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means, in the French president’s words, “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine, saying Moscow was aiming to take “full control” by diplomatic or military means, according to the Elysée. As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said. Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term. “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”. “‘You are lying to yourself,’” Macron told Putin, the official said. “‘It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.’” • This post was amended on 3 March 2022. An earlier version mistakenly attributed the words “the worst is still to come” to Vladimir Putin, rather than Emmanuel Macron. Ukrainian negotiators have arrived by helicopter for talks with the Russian side in Belarus, the Russian state news agency TASS said. On Wednesday, Belarus’s foreign ministry posted a photo of a conference room, saying it had been set up to host a second round of talks. You may have seen a video on social media last week of a Ukrainian man removing a landmine with his bare hands, the cigarette dangling from his mouth reinforcing his apparent nonchalance. While his bravery was applauded, experts are worried about the message this and other similar videos send, Lizzy Davies writes. A spokesperson for the Halo Trust warns: We know from past experience that this doesn’t end well and we’re advising people to stay away. In order to try to raise awareness, the Halo Trust’s colleagues in the cities of Mariupol and Kramatorsk are putting up safety messages in bomb shelters aimed at those civilians who may be tempted to handle munitions and mines themselves. “These are deadly devices,” read the posters, which picture an array of munitions of different shapes and sizes. If you see anything like this or similar to this anywhere: DO NOT GO NEAR THEM. Do not pick them up. No matter what you see others do, these are not safe to touch. Call the local emergency authorities. At least nine people have been killed and four wounded after a Russian airstrike hit two schools and private houses in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Thursday, the governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. In an online post, the Chernihiv governor said: Rescue work is ongoing. According to the state emergency services, there are for now nine people killed and four wounded. The Kyiv Independent reports that there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. A cargo ship has sunk off the Ukrainian port of Odesa after an explosion, Reuters is reporting. Two crew members of the Estonian-owned cargo ship Helt were in a life raft at sea, Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said. The four other crew members are missing, Ilves said. Ilves said: The vessel has finally sunk. Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don’t know where they are at the moment. Russian forces are attempting to prevent civilians in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol from evacuating, its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, has said. Local authorities say Russian troops are creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by actively attacking rail links and bridges, as well as cutting off water and power supply, in a bid to prevent civilians from escaping shelling. Boichenko said in a video broadcast: The invaders are systematically and methodically trying to blockade the city of Mariupol. Constant attacks over the past 24 hours have meant the city has no light, water or heat and local authorities need a ceasefire to restore power, he said. Mariupol city council claimed the Russians are “hindering food supplies, blocking us like in Leningrad” in a statement. Russian soldiers are preventing authorities from evacuating the injured, women and children, the statement said. Boichenko added: We are being destroyed as a nation. This is the genocide of the Ukrainian people. These hypocrites came to ‘save’ Russian-speaking citizens of Mariupol and the region. But they arranged the extermination of Ukrainians -- Mariupol residents of Russian, Ukrainian, Greek and other origins. EU officials in Brussels have said they believe the Ukrainian figures in relation to the deaths of Russian soldiers are accurate, Daniel Boffey writes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday morning that 9,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the fighting since the invasion started on 24 February. On Wednesday, Moscow said that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1,597 others wounded as it announced its own death toll for the first time. Amnesty International has documented three attacks that killed at least nine civilians, including children, in the city of Kharkiv on 28 February. The human rights organisation described the attacks in Ukraine’s second-biggest city, which took place around the same time that talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in Belarus, as “possible war crimes”. One of these attacks, which took place at 12.30pm local time in North Kharkiv, included Russian-manufactured 300mm Smerch rockets with 9N235 cluster munitions, indicating that the attack was launched by Russia, Amnesty said. At least four civilians were killed by the attack, including a child and three people collecting drinking water. Another attack that same day also involved a 300mm Smerch rocket on the city’s central Klochkivska Street. The impact of the strike blew the leg off a woman who had gone shopping during a break in the curfew. She died soon afterwards. A Ukrainian delegation is travelling by helicopter to meet Russian counterparts for a second round of talks, Reuters cites a Ukrainian presidential adviser as saying. Talks between Ukraine and Russia will kick off in a couple of hours, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an online post. Earlier, Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the second round of talks would start in Belarus at 1200 GMT. A Russian negotiator has previously said that a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Russian forces have occupied the regional administration building in Kherson, regional governor Hennadiy Lahuta said, amid conflicting reports about the fate of the strategically important city. In a Facebook, Lahuta said staff had “not given up our duties”. The regional operational staff, which I head, continues to work and address pressing issues to help residents of the region. Russia’s defence ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but Ukraine has said its forces continue to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people. Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. Other restrictions imposed on the city include a curfew from 8pm until 6am with only cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Hello. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. German authorities have reportedly seized the $600m (£450m) superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. It came as the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said it had seized a yacht linked to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat. The finance ministry said the yacht was owned by an entity of which Sechin had been identified as the main shareholder. Usmanov’s 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday, according to a Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry. The yacht has been in the yards of shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October. A spokesperson for shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss declined to give a statement when contacted by the Guardian, but said that all projects by shipbuilder Lürssen would be treated “in accordance with the law”. The time is 1pm in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines so far: Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said. A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm London time but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest on Putin’s war in Ukraine. A missile or bomb hit a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship at the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Olvia, killing one of its crew members, and efforts were under way to rescue the others from the vessel, the state-run ship’s owner said on Thursday. “The ship came under attack and one engineer was killed,” Pijush Dutta, executive director of Bangladesh Shipping Corp, told Reuters. “It was not clear whether it was a bomb or missile or which side launched the attack. The other 28 crewmen are unharmed,” he said without providing further details. The Bangladesh-flagged Banglar Samriddhi had been stuck at the port of Olvia after Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February and had been hit by a missile, a Bangladesh foreign ministry official said earlier on Thursday. Crowds of Ukrainians formed a barrier on Wednesday between Russian forces and a nuclear plant in the city of Enerhodar, blocking their advance. Footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official shows people – some holding Ukrainian flags – assembled in front of and around barricades of cars, trucks, tires and sandbags. Enerhodar is home to Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Thursday. “The occupiers want to turn it into besieged Leningrad,” he said, referring to Nazi Germany’s siege of the then-Soviet city, where about 1.5 million people died during two years of blockade. The European Union will take additional steps against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorates, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday. The bloc is also preparing in case of Russian retaliation, including diversifying the bloc’s energy supplies, Reuters reported. “Our aim is to cut the Kremlin’s capacity to wage war on its neighbours,” Von der Leyen said after a meeting with the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis. “We need to get independent from Russian gas, oil and coal. Our resolve to go forward in this case is stronger than ever,” she added. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, according to a Reuters report. Offering no evidence to back up his remarks in an interview with state television, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, he also accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an ethnic Jew, of presiding over “a society where Nazism is flourishing”. He said he had no doubt that a solution to the crisis in Ukraine would be found, and a new round of talks were about to start between Ukrainian and Russian officials. But he said Russia’s dialogue with the west must be based on mutual respect, accused Nato of seeking to maintain supremacy and said that while Russia had a lot of good will, it could not let anyone undermine its interests. Moscow would not let Ukraine keep infrastructure that threatened Russia, he said. Moscow could also not tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine, he said, adding that he was convinced that Russia was right over Ukraine. “The thought of nuclear is constantly spinning in the heads of western politicians but not in the heads of Russians,” he said. “I assure you that we will not allow any kind of provocation to unbalance us.” Russia did not feel politically isolated, and the question of how Ukraine lives should be defined by its people, he added. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Thursday. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles, Reuters reported. He said a heating system site damaged by Russian shelling on Wednesday would be fixed during the day. Every weekend for most of her youth, while other children were out playing, Natalia Toroshenko attended Ukrainian school, studying the country’s geography, language, its history and national heroes. “Ukraine, and being Ukrainian, is a deep part of me,” she said. “I wasn’t born there, but it’s my ancestral homeland.” Toroshenko grew up in Montreal, thousands of kilometres away from the country her father had left to flee famine and conflict. But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war. Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland. Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations of Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape. China has denounced a report that it asked Russia to delay invading Ukraine until after the Beijing Winter Olympics as “fake news” and a “very despicable” attempt to divert attention and shift blame over the conflict. Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also repeated China’s accusations that Washington provoked the war by not ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. “We hope the culprit of the crisis would reflect on their role in the Ukraine crisis, take up their responsibilities, and take practical actions to ease the situation and solve the problem instead of blaming others,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing. “The New York Times report is purely fake news, and such behaviors of diverting attentions and shifting blames are very despicable,” Wang said. The article cited a “western intelligence report” considered credible by officials. “The report indicates that senior Chinese officials had some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions before the invasion started last week,” the Times wrote. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on 4 February, hours before the Games’ opening ceremony. Following that, the sides issued a joint statement in which they declared “friendship between the two states has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation”. A war crimes investigation has been launched into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula. Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine. The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. Germany is planning to deliver a further 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine following a volte-face on its previously restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons, German media reported on Thursday morning. The shoulder-fired “Strela” surface-to-air rockets, which once belonged to the old arsenal of the National People’s Army of Soviet-controlled East Germany, have been approved for export by Germany’s economic ministry but still await formal approval by the federal security council. The anti-aircraft missiles follow 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles that the German government announced over the weekend would be dispatched to Ukraine. In addition, the government of Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has green-lighted the delivery of weapons from Netherlands and Estonia that once belonged to East Germany. Meanwhile, the German foreign mMinister, Annalena Baerbock, called on Thursday for an urgent inquiry to investigate what she called human rights violations committed by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. “We must stand up to this attack. Human rights are universal,” Baerbock said in a video message to the UN human rights ccouncil. Baerbock added that “we urgently need a commission of inquiry on Ukraine to investigate all violations of human rights that have been committed by Russia since its military aggression. We must stand strong on accountability.” A new UK visa scheme for the extended family members of British Ukranians comes into force from Friday, the Home Office has announced. The announcement came as security minister Damian Hinds denied there was a delay to the scheme, announced on Wednesday, which he said would help a “couple of hundred thousand” refugees. “There is absolutely no suggestion of any kind of delay here - people need help now,” he told Sky News. Asked how many visa applications had been submitted since last Wednesday, Hinds said: “So far a relatively small number - I can’t give you an exact number - but we expect that to grow rapidly.” The announcement was welcomed by British Ukrainians who have been trying to arrange visas for extended family fleeing the Russian invasion. Roman Lytwyniw, 25, who travelled to the Polish town of Przemyśl, near the border with Ukraine, to bring his 80-year-old grandmother back to the UK, said the family had been in limbo for two days, with embassy and Home Official officials unable to help with her visa application. Lytwyniw, a violinist from London, told the Guardian: “I’m not seeing anything yet from that [announcement]. Yesterday, they told me that I’m going to have to reapply for a visa because we didn’t meet the eligibility requirements. “I’ve just been to the British embassy here and they’ve told me that the best thing to do would be to travel to either Rzeszow or Warsaw. Because that’s where the nearest visa application centres are.” A petition calling on the UK government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion has now been signed by more than 100,000 people. EU leaders are expected to discuss and seek to find a common position on Ukraine’s membership application when they gather in Paris next Thursday for an informal summit, officials have said. Leaders will discuss “timing or the conditions”, with positions currently widely diverging among the 27 capitals. Georgia and Moldova are also expected to make formal applications “by the end of the week”, EU officials said. The EU must prepare for the arrival of millions of refugees as they flee war in Ukraine, the bloc’s top home affairs official said on Thursday. She added that she expected governments to agree a temporary protection scheme in the coming days. “Already, almost one million are here,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said, with women and children entering the European Union via Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, which all have land borders with Ukraine. Reuters reported that the bloc’s interior ministers were set to agree in principle at a meeting on Thursday to automatically grant those fleeing Ukraine a residence permit and access to employment, social welfare and housing for up to three years, they said. “Putin’s terrible war of aggression has had terrible consequences for people in Ukraine,” the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said as she arrived at the Brussels meeting. “Today it is about all EU members agreeing on a policy to be able to provide help in a non-bureaucratic way.” The protective measures, once formally approved by EU governments in the coming week, will be granted to Ukrainians and those who had long-term residency or refugee status in Ukraine without them having to go through lengthy asylum procedures. Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power and preventing bringing supplies or evacuating people. “They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad,” the council said in a statement, reported by the Reuters news agency. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying the city’s critical life-support infrastructure. We have no light, water or heat again.” The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s first vice-president, has said the UK has followed the EU’s lead but that the government needs to heed British public opinion and go further. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The UK is now following our lead... I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want. On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had questioned why Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, who now sits on the Russian security council, was not on the UK’s sanctions list but does appear on the EU equivalent. Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny named Shuvalov as the owner of two luxury apartments in Whitehall Court. Damian Hinds, a minister in the Home Office, told the Today programme that “it is not a competition” when asked about the apparent failure of the UK government to go as far as its EU allies. A call by the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand for foreign volunteers to help fight against the Russian invasion has reportedly prompted dozens of inquiries. A Ukrainian embassy official told BenarNews that 40 people had turned up in person to ask about travelling to the country, while up to 100 people called to express interest on Wednesday. The embassy posted an appeal made by Volodymyr Zelenskiy for “friends of peace and democracy” to help Ukraine fight Russia. The statement, posted on its Facebook page, stated: “There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.” The notice has reportedly struck a chord with Thais who participated in the pro-democracy protests that peaked in 2020. Among them is Chanaphong Phongpai, 28, who visited the Ukrainian embassy on Wednesday and spoke to Reuters about his reasons for wanting to fight for Ukraine. “They (Ukrainians) are also fighting for democracy and is now invaded by a superpower and a tyrant, so I asked myself what I can do for them,” he said. Thai government spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek told Reuters that there is no law preventing Thai citizens from joining foreign volunteer forces, but cautioned that people should consider the grave danger they could face on the ground. The Ukrainian embassy did not immediately respond to a request by the Guardian for comment. It has also set up bank accounts for people to donate in Thai baht. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has declined to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, echoing the stance of many south-east Asian countries, which have issued mostly restrained statements on the matter. However, on Wednesday night Thailand was among 141 member states voted for a resolution deploring Russia’s actions and calling for the immediate withdrawal of its force. Ukrainian scientists have signed an open letter urging colleagues around the world to cut off collaboration with Russia. They are calling for an international boycott of scientific events inside Russia and say Russian researchers should be banned from accessing databases. More than 3,000 academics have signed the petition. Dmytro Chumachenko, an associate professor at the national aerospace university in the city of Kharkiv, now under Russian attack, shared the petition and asked his western colleagues to sign it. It reads: The Russian Federation has committed an insidious and completely shameful military attack on our country! In 2022, cruise missiles with cluster munitions and vacuum bombs that are banned in the civilized world are destroying residential areas, kindergartens, and hospitals in the very center of Europe! As of today, the number of dead civilians counts in hundreds (of which 16 are children), and thousands are wounded. The President of the Russian Federation threatens the world with nuclear weapons, which will obviously start the World War III. The armed forces and citizens defend Ukraine to the end! The whole world gives a worthy rebuff to the aggressor through the imposition of sanctions. At the same time, we believe that in this situation the progressive world scientific community should have its say. That is why we need your support right now. In our opinion, in the 21st century and 2022, perhaps the best answer to tanks, multiple rocket launchers, and rockets is closed access to high technologies, innovations, scientific research, and information support. Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video on Thursday, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” Zelenskiy said, adding Ukraine was receiving daily arms supplies from its international allies. He said it had been two years since Ukraine recorded its first Covid case: “It’s been a week now that another virus attacked,” he said of Russia’s invasion. As reported by Reuters, Zelenskiy said Russia’s changing tactics and shelling of civilians in cities proved Ukraine was successful in resisting Moscow’s initial plan of claiming a quick victory through a land assault. It comes as the UN human rights office has said 227 civilians had been killed and another 525 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s military invasion began a week ago. Residents in the key Black sea port of Odesa were stepping up preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships, and US warnings that a landing to target Odesa could happen as early as Thursday. Residents in the city reported on Thursday a marked increase in Russian airstrikes on Wednesday as images emerged of beaches close to the city laid with mines, and other defences being prepared. Concern of surrounding a potential amphibious landing targeting Odesa mounted on Thursday escalated following images of a Russian naval convoy depicting at least eight ships visible off the coast. The convoy appears to include a number of 4,080 tonne Ropucha-class large landing ships and supporting vessels. Two weeks ahead of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several Ropucha class ships – which can each carry ten main battle tanks – entered the Black Sea under the guise of conducting drills along with a larger Ivan Gren class landing ship which can carry 13 tanks or 40 smaller armoured vehicles. The loss Odessa, Ukraine’s biggest port city would be an economic catastrophe for Ukraine. Ekho Moskvy radio station, one of Russia’s last remaining liberal media outlets, has been dissolved by its board after coming under pressure over its coverage of the war in Ukraine, its editor said on Thursday. The station, one of the leading news and current affairs channels in Russia, had been taken off the air two days earlier, Reuters reported. “The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,” the Ekho Moskvy editor-in-chief, Alexei Venediktov, said on the messaging app Telegram. The move came after the prosecutor general’s office demanded this week that access be restricted to Ekho Moskvy and the TV Rain online news channel over their coverage of the conflict. The prosecutor said its move was prompted by their websites’ “targeted and systematic posting ... of information calling for extremist activities, violence and deliberately false information about the actions of Russian forces as part of a special operation” in Ukraine. Russia rejects the term invasion, and says its actions are not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists - a pretext rejected by Ukraine and the west as baseless propaganda. Ekho Moskvy said on Tuesday that the accusations against it were baseless and offensive, and it would fight them in the courts. Ukrainian diplomats formerly based in Moscow arrived in Latvia on Wednesday evening, Latvia’s foreign minister said. “Latvia welcomes Ukrainian diplomats who left Moscow and crossed Latvian-Russian border last night,” minister Edgars Rinkēvičs tweeted on Thursday. Latvia said on Saturday it would give refuge to the diplomats after receiving their plea for help, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Hungary has evacuated 32 people from its embassy in Kyiv, including some Hungarian embassy staff, two journalists, 10 South African and 10 Nigerian nationals, the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Thursday. He said the evacuated embassy staff and foreign nationals crossed over into Hungary overnight. The Australian government has asked Facebook, Twitter, Google and other digital platforms to block content generated by Russian state media to curb “disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote on Thursday to Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and a range of other digital platforms, asking them to take action “as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations”. The other recipients are Apple, TikTok, Twitter, Snap Inc, Reddit, Google and Microsoft. Fletcher cited “a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia is not the first government to make the request, with the European Union’s own ban on Russian state media prompting a number of platforms to crack down on Kremlin-backed news outlets RT and Sputnik. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said on Thursday. Separately, Reuters reported that the governor of the Ukraine-controlled eastern Donetsk region said the port city of Mariupol, one of the first targets of the Russian invasion, was without electricity or water supplies. The Lithuanian prosecutor general’s office said on Thursday it had begun investigating suspected crimes against humanity and war crimes in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. “The investigation was launched with regards to the military aggression in Ukraine,” it said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency. The probe will include “military attacks on civilians, doctors, destruction of homes, hospitals, educational institutions and other civilian facilities, which lead to deaths of adults and children,” it said. Here is a round-up of some of the images from the fallout of Putin’s war in Ukraine today. The Russian military is a “ruthless invading force” which poses a danger immediately to Ukraine, but also to “wider Europe and the world”. Damian Hinds, the UK’s security minister, told Sky News: How concerned am I? We are all desperately concerned. This is a ruthless invading force. When it comes to tactics and military strategy, I’m not going to second guess Vladimir Putin and what he might be thinking, what might be in his head. But we do know that this is a ruthless force, an extremely dangerous (force) obviously imminently right now for Ukraine, but actually dangerous for wider Europe and the world. The bravery, the tenacity of Ukraine, my God, we have all been taken aback and it is so important we do everything we can to support them in what they are doing and make sure - and this is where the sanctions, we’ve got the Economic Crime Bill, transparency and enforcement coming through on Monday in Parliament. It is why all these things are so important, why we absolutely need to make the regime hurt. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. The U-turn comes less than 24 hours after the IPC said it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday, but only as neutral athletes with colours, flags and other national symbols removed. The IPC received immediate criticism for its initial decision, the Associated Press reported. It soon became evident that many athletes would refuse to compete against Russians or Belarusians. IPC President Andrew Parsons, in announcing the initial measures Wednesday in a Beijing news conference, sympathised openly with the Ukrainian people but said his actions were constrained by his organisation’s rules and the fear of legal action. Parsons said almost the opposite in announcing his reversal, noting his constituents had pushed back. “In the last 12 hours, an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us,” Parsons said in a statement. “They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences.” Parsons added: What is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games. Germany is considering supplying 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine as it seeks to defend itself against an invasion by Russia, a government source said on Thursday. German news agency DPA reported earlier that the economy ministry had approved supplying the Soviet-made Strela missiles, part of the inventories of the former German Democratic Republic’s army. A source told Reuters that the Federal Security Council had yet to approve the move. “The missiles are ready to be transported,” the source said. That would come on top of 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles that Germany said on Saturday it would supply to Ukraine, in a shift of policy after Russia invaded its neighbour. Hello. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news on Putin’s war in Ukraine over the next few hours. It is 9.30am in Ukraine on the eighth day of Putin’s war. Here is where the crisis currently stands: A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The latest intelligence report reads: The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days. Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands. Some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson but the military situation remains unclear. The report added that the Russian defence ministry “has been forced to admit” that 498 Russian soldiers have already been killed and 1,597 wounded in Putin’s war, adding that the actual number of those killed and wounded “will almost certainly be considerably higher” and will continue to rise. Quick snap here from Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov. Suited up in khaki attire, the minister gave a tribute to the Ukrainian people. Hungary will not veto European Union sanctions against Russia and the unity of the 27-member bloc is “paramount” amid the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said. In an interview with news website mandiner.hu, Orban said: As far as sanctions are concerned, we will not veto, we will not prevent the EU from imposing sanctions on Russia. EU unity is now paramount.” Orban added that Hungary’s ties with Russia had been “balanced and fair” until the very recent past, but the war has created a new situation. He added, however, that there was no reason to cut energy ties with Moscow. If we abolished energy cooperation with the Russians, the overhead costs of all Hungarian families would triple in a single month. I therefore do not support this move, let Hungarian families not pay the price of the war.” Nearly 15,000 Russian tourists are stuck in the Dominican Republic due to travel restrictions imposed after Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour, the government in Santo Domingo said Wednesday, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. The Caribbean country said it had reached a deal with hotel chains to “guarantee” the tourists’ accommodation “until such time as a solution is found.” The 14,800 Russian tourists are mainly in the eastern province of La Altagracia, home to visitor hotspot Punta Cana. Some 1,900 Ukrainian visitors are also in the country and will remain in their hotels until a repatriation plan is in place. Ukraine’s honorary consul to the Dominican Republic, Ilona Oleksandrivna, has claimed there were some 3,000 of her countrymen and women in the country, of whom 1,200 had been kicked out of their hotels. AFP said they found no stranded foreigners in the main tourist areas. While Russian forces threaten new attacks, the basement of a Kyiv hospital has transformed into a maternity ward, where expecting and new mothers bring new life into a world violently upended by a Russian military invasion. Alina Shinkar is 32 weeks pregnant with her first child. She was admitted to one of Kyiv’s maternity hospitals two weeks ago because of pregnancy complications. “I woke up on the 24th of February, at 5 o’clock in the morning from the hit, that I heard. The explosion. And then I heard women started to cry and scream. The war started.’” Watch Alina’s story in the video below. Pro-Russian forces may launch targeted strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol unless Ukrainian forces there surrender, the Interfax news agency quoted Donetsk separatist commander Eduard Basurin as saying on Thursday. Russia and separatists say they have encircled the city of 430,000 located on the Azov Sea coast. However, an operational update published by the Ukrainian military this morning said the city remains in Ukrainian hands. The International Criminal Court earlier confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. In a statement published to the ICC website, prosecutor, Karim AA Khan QC writes: On 28 February, I announced my decision to seek authorisation to open an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, on the basis of my Office’s earlier conclusions arising from its preliminary examination, and encompassing any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or “the Court”). In the same statement, I indicated that active investigations by my Office would be significantly expedited if a State Party to the Rome Statute (the “Statute”) were to refer the situation to my Office, as provided in article 14 of the Statute... I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced. In total, 39 ICC states have referred atrocities for investigation. German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard on Wednesday. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. A Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry said his 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday. If you missed our earlier report you can read the full story below. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The US State Department said in a statement as reported by Reuters: Russia’s government is also throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia’s citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions.” Russians also used social media to connect to each other and the outside world, it added. The agency called on Putin and the Russian government to immediately “cease this bloodshed” and withdraw troops from Ukraine. A compilation of video footage taken by those currently in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson show Russian troops patrolling the city streets. Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, confirmed Russian forces had landed in the city in a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday. “There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side.” You can watch the footage below. The soaring cost of oil and other key commodities in the wake of the invasion threatens to unleash another bout of damaging inflation and supply shortages on the global economy. The price of benchmark Brent crude oil added another 3.4% in early trade on Thursday to climb to $116.80. The cost of other crucial commodities such as aluminum (2.62%), iron ore (7.75%), copper (1.6%) and wheat (7%) were also on an upward curve, thanks to tighter supplies but also bulk buying by the Chinese government, according to analysts. Tina Teng, markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said commodity prices would keep rising. The Russia-Ukraine war has been pumping up global commodity prices, not only because of the supply disruption, but also resulting from hedging activities. Markets have priced in for a much tighter oil supply, with oil tankers and shippers in a standoff for Russia’s exports. China has also ordered the state-owned buyers to store major commodities, including oil, gas, iron ore and agriculture products. Crude oil futures are heading toward $US120 a barrel. There was also concern about stagflation, where growth falls and prices rise. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at fund manager AMP in Sydney, said: Russia supplies around 30% of Europe’s gas and oil imports and accounts for around 11% of world oil production. In short, investors are worried about a stagflationary shock. Wrapping it all up, our economics editor looks at the threat of a global recession. The Ukrainian military claims Russian troops have been “unsuccessful in almost all directions in which they were advancing”, according to an operational update published this morning. The force added that shelling of residential neighbourhoods in major cities continued overnight while Russian troops pushed forward towards the northern outskirts of Kyiv and Mariupol. According to the Ukrainian military, some Russian troops are requiring the urgent replacement of equipment and personnel, however the Guardian has been unable to confirm these reports. The Russian Federal Security Service leaked information that alerted Ukraine to an assassination plot against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to the cyber-hacking collective Anonymous. In a recently published tweet, the group said: Russian FSB leaked information alerted Ukraine to assassination plot against President @ZelenskyyUa. Now, we can expect an internal power struggle within the Kremlin to overthrow the Putin regime. In the meantime, let’s continue with the attacks,” the tweet read. Anonymous also claimed responsibility for taking down the Russian Space Agency website for a second time. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers have told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. There was no comment from the central bank but it follows a turbulent few days for financial markets in Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The rouble has plunged in value, forcing the central bank to double its key interest rate to 20% in order to protect the currency from speculation. The levy on forex also appears to be a move to prevent trade in the rouble and ringfence the Russian financial system. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken. In a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said: There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side. We don’t have Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here! The developments follow a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Kolykhaiev indicated he negotiated with the invading troops. I made no promises to them. I just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people. Other restrictions imposed on the city include aa curfew from 8pm until 6am with cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Public transport is set to restart soon and pedestrians are being told to “walk one by one, maximum two’. “The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand. They do not conflict,” Kolykhaiev said. We have shown that we are working to secure the city and are trying to eliminate the consequences of the invasion. So far this is how it is. Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.” Earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said: “We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Filippo Grandi said in a post over Twitter on Thursday: In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries. For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided.” It is the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations added. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. Read the full story below. Heartbreaking images have emerged of Ukrainians fleeing their country en route to Poland. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Many have made the journey by bus. Hello, I’m Samantha Lock and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is 7am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said. Russian troops moved in to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late Wednesday. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station, as Russia steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border.

The new chancellor will be given a detailed briefing that will include forecasts for the cap, the likely impact on bills, the impact on different groups of households, and ways of targeting support. The mini package of measures would include cuts in national insurance contributions, the scrapping of planned increases in corporation tax, and temporary removal of green levies from energy bills – all of which have featured prominently in Truss’ campaign – plus additional measures thought necessary in view of the 80% increase in the energy price cap to more than £3,500 expected on 1 October. Truss’ tax pledges alone have been costed at £30bn. Sources said the civil service was examining proposals from the two Tory leadership candidates, with the government machine ready to respond “very quickly” once the new prime minister was chosen. Options will include making the scheme that Sunak announced in May more generous and more closely focused on low-income households. Choices also include changes to universal credit, and a scheme that was proposed by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the head of Ovo, Britain’s third largest largest energy provider, which would cut households’ energy bills for limited usage. Under this plan energy consumption above a certain level would be charged at a higher price; Fitzpatrick said the scheme would channel support towards poorer consumers because high-income households typically used more energy. The need for speed will probably mean a full budget will be pencilled in for later in the autumn, by which time the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will be ready with fresh forecasts for the economy and public finances. A date for the emergency budget has not yet been set, but 21 September has been mooted. If Truss wins the leadership contest she would be flying back from New York City on that day after attending a meeting of the UN general assembly. Kwarteng, at present the business secretary, has recently been in close contact with UK energy companies and has been looking at ways of tackling some of the structural problems with Britain’s wholesale energy markets. Two possible reforms have floated by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi. The energy regulator, Ofgem, announced this month it was changing the methodology of its price cap to enable suppliers to recoup wholesale energy hedging costs sooner – a move that will add several hundred pounds to bills in order to stop energy providers going bust. Zahawi said he was working with the Bank of England to “provide better liquidity in the wholesale market for energy”, which could help reduce the price cap by £400 to £500. Kwarteng is thought to support this initiative and a separate plan that would involve the renegotiation of contracts with some renewable energy suppliers to reflect the fact that their profit margins have soared during the crisis. Some industry watchers have suggested renegotiating existing “renewables obligations certificates” for nuclear power stations, windfarms and biomass projects in favour of contracts for difference, which would cut prices and offer long-term stable revenues for power producers. The industry body Energy UK said such a proposal could reduce energy bills for homes and businesses. In an interview with Sky, Zahawi said he was considering the option of an agreement with companies developing power from other sources, such as renewables, for “a voluntary contract for difference … at a lower price”, but said that would “not be ready until next winter”. Zahawi said: “There are no easy options. That’s the one thing we know.”",

                    "bodyText": "Governing authorities in Germany have urged one of the country’s biggest energy companies to stop dismantling a wind park to make way for an open-pit mine, after activists said the move symbolised a rollback of the government’s climate protection plans. Consisting of eight turbines, the Keyenberg wind park in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia is located about half a mile from the edge of a 48 km² surface mine, named after the local village of Garzweiler. One of the turbines was dismantled last week to make way for the mine’s expansion, with two others to be taken down in the first and last quarter of next year, said a spokesperson for WPD, which manages a portion of the wind park. A spokesperson for Energiekontor, which built and runs the rest of the windfarm, said a time limit to its operational permit meant it expected to have to dismantle the five remaining turbines by the end of 2023. Given that Olaf Scholz’s coalition government has pledged to expand energy production massively from renewable sources under its tenure, and with German citizens this winter worried about power cuts amid a decline in Russian gas deliveries, the energy company that owns the Garzweiler mine said it was aware that dismantling windfarms sent a confusing message. “We realise this comes across as paradoxical,” said Guido Steffen, a spokesperson for RWE. “But that is as matters stand.” Rebuilding the turbines to make way for the expanding mine was part of the original agreement that allowed the windfarm to be constructed in 2001, he added, and not a result of a recent change of German energy policy. Germany’s cabinet passed a decree last month to bring back idled brown coal capacity up to next summer to boost supply, as imports of Russian gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline ground to a standstill. Constructed more than 20 years ago, the turbines at the small Keyenberg wind park are less powerful than modern equivalents, with each producing about 1MW of energy per hour at a wind speed of 15 metres per second, roughly a sixth of the output of a more efficient state of the art turbine. Since windfarms in Germany are no longer eligible for subsidies after 20 years in operation, the park would probably have been “repowered” with new technology or wound down even if it were not for the nearby mine. Nonetheless, North-Rhine Westphalia’s ministry for economic and energy affairs on Monday urged RWE to abort its plans to dismantle the windfarm. “In the current situation, all potential for the use of renewable energy should be exhausted as much as possible and existing turbines should be in operation for as long as possible,” a spokesperson said. “We don’t currently see any necessity to dismantle the wind power plant by the L12 [country road] near the Garzweiler surface mine.” The ministry said it informed RWE of its opinion last week. This month, RWE and North-Rhine Westphalia’s Green-run economic ministry reached a deal for the energy company to turn off two power plants in 2030, eight years earlier than the current legal framework foresees. In exchange, RWE is allowed to extend the running time of two other plants until 2024. Climate activists have accused the Green party of betraying their cause. The dismantling of the turbine, activists said last week, was symbolic of the government reneging on its climate promises as it turned to fossil-fuels and coal in the face of a looming energy crisis. “While our politicians argue about the extension of nuclear power, Germany’s rollback in climate protection is going unnoticed,” said Alexandra Brüne of the local initiative Alle Dörfer Bleiben (All Villages Stay), an alliance of activists lobbying for the preservation of the villages on the edge of the Garzweiler mine. “Our region is being devastated, the climate is spiralling out of control – and now the wind turbines are being dismantled for more coal,” Brüne said. “We are seeing an energy transition rollback in the middle of the climate catastrophe, it’s absurd.” Shortly after being sworn in last December, Germany’s left-liberal “traffic light” coalition government announced its intention to boost renewables expansion after years of sluggish growth. The economic and energy ministry, led by the Green party, has committed Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next 10 years. Nature protection laws have been trimmed with the intention of speeding up planning applications for wind parks near bird nesting sites. With the new rules still to trickle down to the country’s 16 federal states, wind energy companies say the effect of these changes has yet to materialise. About 365 turbines were built in Germany between January and September, a year-on-year increase of 5.5%. The number of wind projects that were approved over the same period has gone down, however 524 turbines were granted building permission, a year-on-year decrease of 16.2%. During his victorious campaign for the federal German vote last September, Scholz said it should be possible to build new windfarms in six months rather than six years. But as of 21 October this year, the planning application for a windfarm in Germany still takes 23 months on average. The German Wind Energy Association calculates that about 10,000MW of power from renewables are stuck in the administrative process. “These projects have to be quickly authorised by the end of the year so that expansion can be can gain new dynamism over the coming years,” said the chief executive, Wolfram Axthelm. • This article was amended on 27 October 2022 to correct the detail of the energy production of the Keyenberg wind park turbines.",

The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities, in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. With its army losing ground to Ukraine’s counteroffensive, Moscow has started to deploy drones to attack Ukrainian targets. According to Ukrainian military officials, “kamikaze drones” are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but have proved effective at causing damage to targets on the ground. The Shahed-136 drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and exploding on impact. On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani denied supplying the drones to Russia, calling the claims “baseless”. However, the Ukrainian military said its forces had shot down more than 20 drones over the last 24 hours and that most were Iranian-made. On Wednesday, Russia allegedly deployed another six drones to bombard Bila Tserkva, a city about 55 miles (90km) from Kyiv, injuring one person, according to the regional governor. “This is a new threat for all the defence forces [of Ukraine] and we need to use all available means to try to counter it,” the Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said, comparing the drone’s small size with an artillery shell. Kyiv says Moscow started using Iranian drones in September, targeting electrical power stations, electricity transmission lines and waterworks with long-range weaponry. According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, the Iranian drones are unlikely to significantly affect the course of the war. “They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate non-linear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,” wrote analysts at the thinktank. Ukraine’s state emergency service said the death toll from missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia city on Thursday had increased to 11 after seven rockets were fired before dawn into residential buildings. At least 15 people are still missing, according to city officials. “There are neither military nor important objects near the hit site, only civilian buildings and apartment buildings,” Starukh said. Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russia said it considered the whole of Zaporizhzhia province, including Zaporizhzhia city, part of Russia. A law signed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, clarified that Russia was laying claim to all four regions it had annexed, illegally, in their entirety – despite the fact Russia does not wholly control any of them and is in retreat. Zaporizhzhia, close to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been the target of several fatal attacks in the past week. Last week, 30 people died and 88 were injured when a rocket hit the city. Some of the victims were waiting in a queue on the outskirts of the city to enter the occupied territories while others were waiting at a bus stop. In a separate development, at least five people were killed and as many injured after Ukrainian forces struck a bus while shelling a strategically important bridge in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Ukraine is continuing to make advances in the east and south of the country, with Russian troops retreating under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced in his nightly address on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had liberated more than 500 sq km of territory in Kherson alone since the start of October. Russian-backed separatist forces however said on Friday they had captured ground in Donetsk, their first claim of new gains, saying they had captured a series of villages near the industrial town of Bakhmut, which has been under Russian shelling for weeks. “On the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a grouping of troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, with fire support from Russian forces, liberated Otradovka, Veselaya Dolina and Zaitsevo,” the separatists said on social media. Putin appeared to admit to losses on Wednesday in a televised call with teachers, saying the Kremlin was “working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise”. In a video addressed to Russian troops on Friday, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, urged them to lay down their arms, promising them “life and safety” if they did so. “We guarantee life, security and justice to everyone who refuses to fight immediately,” Reznikov said. “And we will get a tribunal for those who gave criminal orders. You can still save Russia from tragedy, and the Russian army from humiliation.” Reznikov said Russian troops had been “deceived and betrayed” by the Kremlin, citing how Moscow’s soldiers were now paying “with blood for someone’s fantasies and false goals”. Military analysts say Russia is at its weakest point, having lost masses of equipment and fighters, and is unlikely to be able to regain any ground unless its mobilisation proves a success. Russia announced the partial mobilisation of 300,000 men in September after it lost control of half of Ukraine’s north-east Kharkiv province.",

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. <strong>Vladimir</strong> <strong>Putin </strong>has previously made comments saying he wants to avoid nuclear war, but his foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> told a UN hearing on Monday that the world was “possibly more dangerous” than during the cold war.</p></li> <li><p>The Kremlin said that relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level” amid more expulsions of diplomats. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict</strong> when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders.</p></li> <li><p>Nato’s secretary general <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong> also welcomed the discussion between president Xi and president Zelenskiy and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles have now been delivered to Ukraine.</strong> This comprises 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”</strong>, at a session on Thursday.</p></li> <li><p>A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut</strong>, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison</strong> on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine</strong> during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should.</strong> “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2023/18/andrij-melnyk-kiew-ukraine-krieg?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut</strong> to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists.</p></li> <li><p><strong>At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday</strong>, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested</strong>. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February</strong> and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January.</p></li> </ul> <p>That’s all for today.

One representative voted against and another abstained.</p> <p>In its resolution, the assembly called for “immediate and urgent action to be taken to halt the practices of unlawful forcible transfer and deportation currently being carried out by the Russian Federation against the Ukrainian population, and especially its policy and practices relating to the removal of children from their families and homes and their subsequent absorption into Russian citizenship, identity and culture.”</p> <p>It added: “The assembly highlights the need for the recording and monitoring of individual cases, both in order to permit mechanisms for rapid redress, and to collect evidence of accountability in order to bring the perpetrators, at all levels of responsibility, to justice.”</p> <p>The assembly called for the practice to stop “immediately and unconditionally”. It also demanded Russia give access to NGOs and charities, as well as information about where the children now are.</p> <p>The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> in March in relation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes\">the “unlawful deportation” of minors</a>.

An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city.</p> <p>“These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute.</p> <p>They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP.</p> <p>The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to attempt to limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct a counteroffensive”, he said.</p> <p>Moscow’s strategy is to be able to “absorb any attack”, said Pierre Razoux at the Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies, a French research body.</p> <p>“The attackers are likely to get stuck by the time they reach the second layer, and even if they get past it, the third is going to be very hard to breach,” he said.</p> <p>Russia will employ the time-honoured strategy of channelling attacking enemy troops onto ground of their choosing, said Andrew Galer at British strategy thinktank Janes.</p> <p>But Ukraine meanwhile gets to decide where to attack Russian lines, he said, adding that Kyiv may not have made its choice yet.</p> <p>Ukraine could well try to mislead Russia with a small-scale attack to pull defending forces there, and then direct the main attack elsewhere, he said.</p> <p>Vassily Kashin, at the HSE university in Moscow, said Ukraine could pick the region of Bakhmut where battles have raged for 10 months for its attack, but acknowledged that “the data we have are very limited”.</p> <p>Kashin said the balance of forces at the front is changing in favour of Russia. “Ukraine can try to change this with a last desperate blow,” he said.</p> </div>   <p

“convincing example of how much you, President Erdoğan, are doing for your country, for the growth of its economy, for all Turkish citizens”.</p> <p>“I want to say it straight: you know how to set ambitious goals and are confidently moving towards their implementation,” he added.</p> <p>Putin stressed that Russia was one of the first countries to send rescue teams and medical personnel to

                    "bodyText": "As the time approaches 9pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a round-up of today’s news. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric over their use. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. Vladimir Putin has previously made comments saying he wants to avoid nuclear war, but his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told a UN hearing on Monday that the world was “possibly more dangerous” than during the cold war. The Kremlin said that relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level” amid more expulsions of diplomats. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the discussion between president Xi and president Zelenskiy and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”. Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles have now been delivered to Ukraine. This comprises 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. That’s all for today. Thanks for following along. We’ll be back tomorrow. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. In its resolution, the assembly called for “immediate and urgent action to be taken to halt the practices of unlawful forcible transfer and deportation currently being carried out by the Russian Federation against the Ukrainian population, and especially its policy and practices relating to the removal of children from their families and homes and their subsequent absorption into Russian citizenship, identity and culture.” It added: “The assembly highlights the need for the recording and monitoring of individual cases, both in order to permit mechanisms for rapid redress, and to collect evidence of accountability in order to bring the perpetrators, at all levels of responsibility, to justice.” The assembly called for the practice to stop “immediately and unconditionally”. It also demanded Russia give access to NGOs and charities, as well as information about where the children now are. The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in March in relation to the “unlawful deportation” of minors. One was also issued for Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova who is believed to have 18 adopted children, including a teenager from Mariupol. The resolution claims that Russia began moving children from the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk before its invasion on 24 February last year. In a report earlier this month, the Ukrainian government said it had collected reports of more than 19,000 children who had been deported. The Ukrainian security service has given details of eight men of military age who had tried to leave Ukraine to avoid serving in the armed forces. It said that a group was charging up to $7,000 (£5,600) to help people illegally cross the border, including with false documents. Ten have been arrested in total across Ukraine. One was a taxman in the Poltava oblast who sold fake medical certificates, and another in Kharkiv is suspected of helping people evade military service by posing as business travellers for defence firms. Other schemes to smuggle people out include disguising them as truck drivers, the SBU reports. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. The Russian defensive wall runs from Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, to the north-east of the country, spanning more than 500 miles. An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city. “These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute. They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP. The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to attempt to limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct a counteroffensive”, he said. Moscow’s strategy is to be able to “absorb any attack”, said Pierre Razoux at the Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies, a French research body. “The attackers are likely to get stuck by the time they reach the second layer, and even if they get past it, the third is going to be very hard to breach,” he said. Russia will employ the time-honoured strategy of channelling attacking enemy troops onto ground of their choosing, said Andrew Galer at British strategy thinktank Janes. But Ukraine meanwhile gets to decide where to attack Russian lines, he said, adding that Kyiv may not have made its choice yet. Ukraine could well try to mislead Russia with a small-scale attack to pull defending forces there, and then direct the main attack elsewhere, he said. Vassily Kashin, at the HSE university in Moscow, said Ukraine could pick the region of Bakhmut where battles have raged for 10 months for its attack, but acknowledged that “the data we have are very limited”. Kashin said the balance of forces at the front is changing in favour of Russia. “Ukraine can try to change this with a last desperate blow,” he said. More from Vladimir Putin’s speech at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear power plant in Turkey on Thursday. Putin praised the leadership of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of an election where Erdoğan is running to be re-elected. Erdoğan, 69, suspended all campaigning for Turkey’s pivotal presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May after falling ill while conducting a live TV interview on Tuesday. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. The Russian president spoke virtually at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear plant in Turkey, using the opportunity to heap praise on Erdoğan, saying Moscow was ready to “extend the hand of friendship”. Putin said the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkey’s first, was a “convincing example of how much you, President Erdoğan, are doing for your country, for the growth of its economy, for all Turkish citizens”. “I want to say it straight: you know how to set ambitious goals and are confidently moving towards their implementation,” he added. Putin stressed that Russia was one of the first countries to send rescue teams and medical personnel to Turkey in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in February. “We are always ready to extend the hand of friendship to our Turkish partners,” Putin added. Here’s a selection of photographs from the conflict in Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian clamour for US-made F-16 jets has continued, with the country’s foreign minister and home office adviser tweeting on the subject earlier on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba and Anton Gerashchenko said that F-16s would deter Russia rather than provoke it, and it would help ensure “protection of Europe”. Russia has destroyed a bridge in Chernihiv, according to the north-eastern oblast’s governor. Viacheslav Chaus told a telethon that Russian shelling had destroyed the crossing over the Sudost River. It connected the villages of Muravyi and Gremyach near Novgorod-Siversky. Serhii Serhienko, the head of the Novgorod-Siversky district military administration said: “For several weeks, the bridges over the rivers of the Novgorod-Siversk community have been shelled. This makes it impossible to provide services to the population in a normal format: to provide food and other things. And it limits movement to the central self-government bodies.” A former commander of Russia’s Wagner group who is seeking asylum in Norway has been convicted of carrying an air gun and being involved in a bar fight. Andrei Medvedev was given a two-week sentence which has been suspended for two years. He was acquitted of violence against the police, Reuters reports. “I want to thank the court for a fair ruling,” Medvedev told Reuters, adding he was looking to the future. “I am studying Norwegian and I hope I will get asylum.” He crossed the Russian-Norwegian border in January and has spoken out about his time fighting in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to fighting outside an Oslo bar in February and preventing a police officer from doing his or her duty. He also pleaded guilty to carrying an air gun in public on a separate occasion on 14 March. But Medvedev had pleaded not guilty to a fourth charge of committing violence against a police officer. He was acquitted on Thursday. Separately, Medvedev will continue to speak with Norwegian police about his time with Wagner. Russia denies accusations of war crimes in the conflict. “Now he can avoid jail and focus on what he came [to Norway] for: explain [about his time] in the war in Ukraine,” his lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told Reuters. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv (see 05.49). The governor of Mykolaiv province, Vitalii Kim, said 22 multi-storey buildings, 12 private houses and other residential buildings were damaged in the attack, Associated Press reports. Defence officials said the Kalibr missiles were fired from somewhere in the Black Sea. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. Prigozhin said in an audio message on Thursday: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” In a later audio message, however, he said: “Guys, this is military humour. Humour, and nothing more ... It was a joke,” Reuters reported. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut since the summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – who was deeply critical of what he saw as Germany’s hesitancy over providing material support to Ukraine from the start of Russia’s invasion – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Melnyk, who returned to Ukraine in October as deputy foreign minister, was perceived as something of a thorn in the side of the government of Olaf Scholz for his frequent interventions in debates on Ukraine, which he himself describes as “often undiplomatic”. He said he regretted he was no longer able to use his influence on Berlin. “A year ago we were powerful participants in the debate, and even steering it. But my successor does it differently,” he said. “Now we’re simply swimming with the current, letting ourselves go with the flow.... Our offensive is going to happen, and the Germans think: ‘We’ve delivered 18 Leopards (tanks), ticked that off the list, finito’. As if the war had been won with these tanks. The coalition government has … convinced the German public that regarding military help, everything is sorted. Which is not true.” Instead of “continuing to bang the drum”, his successor, Oleksiy Makeev, was “repeating mantra-like, ‘Thankyou Germany’,” Melnyk said, adding that he was “hardly” in touch with Makeev, due to their “very different points of view”. He denied his return to Ukraine – where his particular responsibility is relations with Latin America - was an attempt to rein him in. “My post there was long enough and it was a miracle that I was able to stay there when the war started,” he said. But he admitted he had not wanted to leave. “It is no secret that I left Berlin against my will. I would have liked to have continued, because I had the feeling that I could have achieved a lot more for Ukraine … despite the strong headwinds I faced. “Here in Kjiv the opposition was stronger still, because many didn’t understand why I was often acting in this very unconventional, often undiplomatic way in order to pull the government out of its lethargy.” Here’s some analysis of President Xi and President Zelenskiy’s call on Wednesday by our correspondent Helen Davidson in Taipei, and why it may have been hastened by problematic comments about sovereignty by a Chinese ambassador. A long-awaited phone call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been cautiously welcomed, but China analysts say the timing suggests it could be partly an act of damage control after controversial comments by China’s ambassador to France. Ambassador Lu Shaye, one of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats with a history of fiery remarks, caused outrage across Europe this week when he denied the sovereignty of former Soviet states, saying they “did not have effective status”. The comments were roundly condemned, with several European nations summoning Chinese envoys for rebuke, and politicians suggesting it demonstrated China’s untrustworthiness as a neutral party in the Ukraine war. Beijing, which counts Russia as its closest major ally, has sought to present itself as neutral and a potential peacemaker and there have been signs that Xi was unhappy with Russia’s actions, but in practice China has largely supported Russia’s stance. “At a time when there is already significant concern about Russian ambitions and PRC [People’s Republic of China] support for them, Lu’s comments seemed to suggest that Beijing is open to continued, perhaps even expanded, Russian aggression,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. Read more: Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. Lavrov led a session of the UN security council on multilateralism, in which he said the world was at its most dangerous since the cold war. He had requested to bring journalists with him from Russia, but they were barred from entering the US. “It was particularly emphasised [to the US diplomat] that such sabotage, intended to prevent normal journalistic work, would not go unanswered,” the foreign ministry said in its statement. Gerschkovich has previously been visited by Lynne Tracy, the US ambassador to Russia. The visit would have taken place on 11 May. The Kremlin has said it is considering other retaliatory measures against the US over the rejection of visas. He was arrested last month in the city of Ekaterinburg by Russia. The 31-year-old has been charged with espionage, which he has denied, and appeared in court on Tuesday. The US has designated him as wrongfully detained by Russia. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. “I invited His Holiness to visit Ukraine in person,” Shmyhal told reporters at the Foreign Press Association in Rome a few hours after the papal audience. He said he had discussed with the 86-year-old pope the peace plan proposed by Volodymyr Zelenskiy to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. This included “discussing in a little more detail the different steps the Vatican could take” to help Kyiv achieve its goals, the prime minister said, speaking through an Italian translator. “For example, I asked for the participation, the assistance from the Vatican, from His Holiness, for the return to Ukraine of children, some of whom were orphaned, who were taken away by force, mainly to Russia.” More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the February 2022 invasion, according to Kyiv, with many allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes. Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. In March, the international criminal court announced an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. The pope has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine, although the Vatican’s attempts to mediate in the conflict have yet to yield any results. Shmyhal was in Rome on Wednesday for a conference on how Italian businesses could help with the reconstruction of Ukraine, when he also met with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni. Russia is not planning to take the path of nuclear escalation in its standoff with the west over Ukraine but others should not test its patience, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Her comments follow a flurry of warnings by senior Russian officials, including president Vladimir Putin, that western military support for Ukraine is increasing the risks of a catastrophic nuclear conflict. “We will do everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario, but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests,” Zakharova told a regular news conference according to Reuters. “I do not recommend that anybody doubt our determination and put it to the test in practice,” she added. Russia has strongly criticised the supply of western arms to Ukraine and the expansion of the Nato military alliance closer to its borders. Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, this month became the 31st member of Nato, while Ukraine itself also wishes to join, though it faces opposition from some countries. “They [the US] continue to deliberately infringe on our fundamental interests, deliberately generate risks and raise the stakes in the confrontation with Russia …,” said Zakharova. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a close Putin ally, said earlier this week that the world was “quite probably on the verge of a new world war”. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Reuters could not independently confirm the claim. Russian forces have been struggling for months to capture the city in eastern Ukraine. In the news conference Stoltenberg also welcomed the telephone conversation between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday– their first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion. It has been thought he is trying to maximise potential political benefits from the conflict. The Chinese leader, who made a friendly visit to Moscow last month, has come under increased pressure from western nations to step in and mediate. He said he will send a peace delegation to Kyiv. “Maybe this war will end at the negotiating table,” Stoltenberg said. But he stressed that “it is for Ukraine to decide what are the conditions for talks and what format any talks should have”. In any case, Stoltenberg said, “any possibility for meaningful negotiations requires that Ukraine has the necessary military strength to send a very clear message to President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield”. Following earlier comments by Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg that nearly all promised combat vehicles have been delivered to Ukraine, Agence France-Presse (AFP) has details on how much has been sent. In a news conference, Stoltenberg said the total was made up of 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. “This will put Ukraine in a strong position to continue to retake occupied territory,” the secretary general said. Nato members have provided anti-aircraft systems and artillery while Poland and the Czech Republic have given Soviet-built MiG-29 aircraft. Training has also been given to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers. Stoltenberg emphasised this “unprecedented military support to Ukraine” but cautioned that “we should never underestimate Russia”. Moscow was mobilising more ground forces and was “willing to send in thousands of troops with very high casualty rates,” he said, adding that Nato members need to “stay the course”. Stoltenberg said that a Nato summit in July in Lithuania would set out plans for a “multi-year programme of support” for Ukraine. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group said on Thursday it was suspending artillery fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to safely show the city to visiting US journalists. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner’s founder, said in an audio message published by his press service: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” Prigozhin in the same message warned the Ukrainian side not to try to bring in any extra forces under cover of the journalists’ visit. Reuters could not immediately independently verify whether Wagner had suspended its artillery fire or not. A day earlier, Prigozhin lambasted the defence ministry for not sending much-needed shipments of ammunition to his fighters. The EU is expected to agree to keep its markets open to tariff-free Ukrainian grain for another year on Friday, despite objections from central and eastern European countries hit by declining agricultural prices. A proposal to extend tariff-free access for Ukrainian grain into mid-2024 is expected to be approved by a majority of EU member states, overriding opposition from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, according to a diplomatic source. MEPs on the European parliament’s international trade committee on Thursday voted to keep in place the suspension of import duties on Ukraine’s agricultural products for another year, paving the way for an agreement with EU member states. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian farm produce following the Russian invasion and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the import of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although foodstuffs can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. EU officials argue that Ukraine’s continuing grain exports are helping keep the country afloat at a time when the government in Kyiv risks running out of money. One senior EU official contrasted the €26bn Ukrainian businesses earned over the past 12 months from exports including grain, with the €18bn the EU intends to lend Kyiv this year to keep Ukraine’s public sector functioning. “If we didn’t have this €26[bn], [EU aid] would be even higher.” As the time approaches 2pm in Kyiv, here is a roundup of developments in the ongoing conflict. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Germany is one of the latest country to send diplomats home, expelling 20 on Saturday. Russia responded by expelling 40. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated that the Kremlin welcomed the call between China and Ukraine on Wednesday, adding: “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain after the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv overnight and has killed one person and injured 23 more. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. The broadcaster RFM FM said the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. In an urgent question to the defence minister Andrew Murrison, the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said: “I am concerned momentum behind our military help is faltering, and our UK commitment to Ukraine is flagging. “No statement on Ukraine from the defence secretary since January. No new weapons announced for Ukraine since February. No 2023 Action Plan for Ukraine, despite being promised last August. No priorities set for the London Ukraine recovery conference in June,” he told MPs. “The prime minister said in February the UK ‘will be the first country to provide Ukraine with longer-range weapons’. What? And when? The defence secretary said on Friday that ‘delivery is accelerating’ of military aid. How? And what?” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was not present to give a response, but Murrison, one of his deputies, said the UK was “one of the leading providers of military support for Ukraine”. A total of 14,000 Ukrainian troops had been trained by the UK so far, and the total was expected to reach 20,000 this year, he added. Vladimir Putin will speak to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later on Thursday, the Kremlin has said, before the two countries mark the inauguration of Turkey’s first nuclear power reactor, built by Russia. The Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey’s southern Mersin province has been built by Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing that after their telephone conversation the two presidents would take part – virtually – in a ceremony marking the loading of nuclear fuel into the first power unit at Akkuyu. The $20bn, 4,800-megawatt project to build four reactors will allow Turkey to join the small club of nations with civil nuclear energy. Asked about alleged health problems that Erdoğan is having, Peskov said Moscow knew nothing of the issue. Turkey faces landmark presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May. But Erdoğan cancelled his campaign rallies scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday for health reasons. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Countries including Moldova, Sweden and Norway have all expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said all such measures would be responded to in kind. The Kremlin said it welcomed anything that could bring the end of the Ukraine conflict closer when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders, Reuters reports. The call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy had long been sought by Kyiv. Moscow added that still needed to achieve the aims of what it continues to call its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was familiar with the details of what the two leaders had discussed and said their stances on the conflict were well known, according to Reuters. “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself,” Peskov said. “As for the fact that they communicated – that is a sovereign matter for each of these countries and a question of their bilateral dialogue.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. He also welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, their first since Russia invaded Ukraine, but said it “doesn’t change the fact that China has still not condemned” the Russian invasion. Jack Teixeira, the US Air National Guardsman accused of leaking military secrets and keeping an arsenal of weapons in his bedroom, appears in court for a detention hearing today (see 06.29). Reuters reports that federal prosecutors are expected to argue that Texeira, who was arrested on 13 April in Massachusetts and charged with violating the Espionage Act, should remain in custody as a national security risk. The 21-year-old is alleged to have leaked classified documents, including some relating to troop movements in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, to gamers on the messaging app Discord. He kept a gun locker two feet from his bed containing handguns, bolt-action rifles and a military-style rifle. FBI agents also found a gas mask, ammunition and what appeared to be a silencer in his desk drawer. “The defendant undoubtedly poses a danger to the US at large based on his ability to cause exceptionally grave danger to the US national security,” a motion filed by the office of US attorney Rachael Rollins said. “There is also evidence to suggest that the defendant may also pose a physical danger to the community.” The remains of an “unidentified military object” found in a forest in northern Poland (see 08.03) could be part of a missile stuck in the ground, Polish broadcster RMF FM has said. Reuters cites RFM as saying the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. No sources were named. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in Ukraine after two people were killed last November by what Warsaw said was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. The analyst Ulrich Speck has an interesting thread on what may lie behind Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (see 05.30), their first since Russia invaded Ukraine. For Xi, who said China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, “the war in Ukraine is first and foremost an opportunity to advance his geopolitical agenda”, Speck argues. The Chinese leader aims to weaken Russia (though not too much), split Europe from the US by playing nice to the EU, and similarly weaken the US by isolating it from Europe, he says. “Making peace in Ukraine or defending its sovereignty is nowhere on the list,” Speck concludes. “It’s debatable whether Chinese interests as defined by Xi are helped more by an ongoing and even escalating war in Ukraine or by a ceasefire.” The Twitter thread begins here: EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year, reports Politico. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain following the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the impact of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although food can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. Officials hoped this emergency help for central and eastern Europe would ease the decision on extending Ukraine’s duty-free access for one year, but a deal is yet to be reached. Officials are still hopeful of finding a deal, with diplomats due to vote on the plans on Friday. A jailed former presidential hopeful in Belarus, which has been hit with western sanctions for allowing Russian troops to launch their invasion of Ukraine from its territory, has been transferred to hospital from prison, AFP reports. Viktor Babariko, 59, a high-profile candidate who wanted to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020 elections, is undergoing surgery in a hospital in Novopolotsk, authorities confirmed. Babariko was jailed in 2021 on charges of bribery and tax evasion and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Belarus has jailed or forced into exile all the leading political figures who contested Lukashenko’s re-election. A reminder that Alessio Mamo, one of several freelance photographers who have worked extensively with the Guardian in Ukraine since the start of the war, last night won the photojournalism category in Amnesty International’s media awards. Alessio won for this remarkable piece, with Guardian reporters Lorenzo Tondo, Emma Graham-Harrison and Isobel Koshiw, documenting the scale of the violence that has been integral to Russia’s campaign. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian town of Mykolaiv overnight, authorities have said (see 05.49), injuring 23 people. Here are some agency pictures of the aftermath of the strike that have just come through. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. Reuters reported that it was not immediately clear what the object was, where it came from, or how long it had been there. The justice minister said it was found in a forest. “The situation does not threaten the safety of residents. The location of the discovery is being investigated” by Polish officers and military police, the interior ministry said. The Globsec thinktank has published a report – you can read it here – on the “complex, costly and almost impossibly challenging” task Ukraine will eventually face in demining its territory and clearing it of deadly ordnance and explosives. About 30% of Ukraine’s territory (174,000 sq km) will require survey and clearance of vast amounts of ordnance, it says, making the country “the largest mined territory in the world, surpassing such former frontrunners as Afghanistan and Syria”. Much of the area affected is of course difficult or impossible to assess since fighting is still ongoing: around 18% of Ukraine’s territory remains under occupation. Russian troops are also “infamously creative in leaving mine-traps”, the report says, planting “victim-activated devices on animals and dead bodies, as well as double and even triple booby-traps on roads, fields and forests”. And it says the pace of demining work is cripplingly slow, with operations in areas controlled by Ukraine in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions between 2015 and 2021 succeeding in clearing only about 6% of potentially contaminated territory . That represents about 64 sq km a year, with most of the work done by the special services of Ukraine’s defence and interior ministries supported by international NGOs such as the HALO Trust. Reuters has taken a hard look at satellite imagery of Russia’s “vast network of fortifications, sweeping down from western Russia through eastern Ukraine and on to Crimea” and built in readiness for Ukraine’s expected counteroffensive. The news agency says it has examined thousands of defensive positions, both inside Russia and along Ukrainian front lines, and concluded Russia is most heavily defended in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and the gateway to the Crimean Peninsula. Military experts have told Reuters the extensive, layered defences, most built since Ukraine’s advance last November, could make things harder for Kyiv this time and that progress would hinge on Ukrainian forces’ ability to carry out complex, combined operations effectively. Neil Melvin of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said: It’s not the numbers for the Ukrainians. It’s can they do this kind of warfare, combined arms operations? The Russians have shown they can’t do it and they’ve gone back to their old Soviet method of attrition. Analysts have said a Ukrainian counteroffensive could change the dynamics of the war, which has become a bloody battle of attrition, and believe the sheer length of the front could leave Russia’s defences severely exposed. But they warn that Ukraine is unlikely to receive any more armoured weaponry from the west for some time, meaning Kyiv is under pressure to retake as much land as possible in case military support begins to wane. Melvin added: We’ve cleaned out most of the stocks in the West. It’s going to take some years to rebuild. I think this is Ukraine’s big opportunity to press on. Hello, this is Jon Henley taking over from Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you the latest news from – and related to – Ukraine as it happens, for the rest of the European morning. That’s it from me for now. My colleague Jon Henley will take you through the rest of the day’s news from Ukraine. Zelenskiy has posted a video showing the damage caused by a Russian strike on Mykolaiv overnight – the number of wounded has now risen to 23, including a child, he says. Zelenskiy wrote: The country-invader never ceases to prove that the main goal of this war is terror and the destruction of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian. At night, Russia shelled Mykolaiv with four Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea. High-precision weapons were aimed at private houses, a historic building and a high-rise building. At the moment, it is known about 1 killed and 23 wounded, including a child. Eternal memory to the deceased and speedy recovery to the wounded. Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to keep behind bars a Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents, arguing he may still have access to secret national defence information that he could expose, the Associated Press reports. In court papers filed late Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers said releasing 21-year-old Jack Teixeira from jail while he awaits trial would be a grave threat to US national security. Investigators are still trying to determine whether he kept any physical or digital copies of classified information, including files that haven’t already surfaced publicly, they wrote. “There simply is no condition or combination of conditions that can ensure the Defendant will not further disclose additional information still in his knowledge or possession,” prosecutors wrote. “The damage the Defendant has already caused to the US national security is immense. The damage the Defendant is still capable of causing is extraordinary.” The documents Teixeira is accused of leaking provided a wide variety of highly classified information on allies and adversaries, with details including Ukraine’s air defences: Brussels also welcomed the conversation Xi and Zelenskiy, thought to be their first call since Russia invaded Ukraine. “It is an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council,” said European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer. “China’s leadership needs to use its influence to bring Russia to end its war of aggression, restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity and respect its sovereignty, as a basis for a just peace.” The White House has welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, told reporters that the call was a “good thing,” but regarding whether it would lead to a meaningful move toward peace, “I don’t think we know that yet.” The governor of the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv said Russian missiles had also hit an apartment building and a private house in the city of the same name. One person was killed and 15 were injured, Vitaliy Kim wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The Guardian was not able to verify battlefield reports. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, in a report on Facebook, said fighting gripped Bakhmut and nearby areas. It said Russian forces had failed to advance on two villages to the north-west. At least a dozen localities came under Russian fire. Separately, Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north – near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens. Our top story this morning: Russian forces are pounding the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east. Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked Ukraine’s east and northeast 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north, near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. And both the US and European Union have welcomed news of a call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the EU calling the call, the first between the two leaders since the war began, “an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council”. Here are the other key recent developments: China’s president, Xi Jinping, spoke to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday for the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv had publicly sought such talks for months. Zelenskiy described the hour’s phone call as “long and meaningful”. Xi told Zelenskiy that China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, Chinese state media reported. The White House welcomed the phone call, but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal. Russia’s envoy to the UN in Geneva said no real progress had been achieved in resolving issues raised by Moscow over the Black Sea grain deal, which is due to expire next month. British fighter jets helped in a joint Nato response to intercept three Russian planes, including two SU-27 fighter jets, over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday. The head of Russia’s private Wagner militia said Ukraine was preparing for an “inevitable” counter-offensive and was sending well-prepared units to the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, for many months the focal point of fighting. The Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says he is being investigated on terrorism charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison, Reuters has reported. The Kremlin critic is serving sentences totalling 11 and a half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court, which human rights groups say were made up to silence him. Italy has said it wants to play a major role in the reconstruction of Ukraine and urged EU bodies to back the rebuilding. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, met the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday. A Ukrainian reporter working as a fixer for Italy’s daily newspaper Repubblica was shot dead by snipers in Kherson, while his Italian colleague was wounded, the newspaper said. “Our correspondent Corrado Zunino and his fixer Bogdan Bitik were victims of an ambush by Russian snipers today on the outskirts of Kherson, in southern Ukraine.” Russia is resettling poor citizens from its remote regions in the occupied east of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. Hanna Mailar said the inward migration to Ukraine was mainly being seen in Luhansk. In a press conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said there was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. In a joint conference with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, Lula said that “no one can doubt that Brazilians condemn Russia’s [invasion]. The mistake happened and the war started.”",

                    "bodyText": "Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site.",

Two loud explosions rocked Kyiv on Thursday evening, after António Guterres went to the site of massacres and mass graves on the city’s outskirts, and met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces destroyed the production facilities of a space-rocket plant in Kyiv with high-precision long-range missiles. It is being reported that the journalist Vera Girich was killed in the missile strikes on the city. The ministry posted a video claiming to show cruise missiles being launched into Ukraine from a submarine of the Black Sea fleet. Ukraine hopes to evacuate civilians who are holed up in the Azovstal steel plant with the last fighters defending the southern city of Mariupol. “An operation is planned today to get civilians out of the plant,” Zelenskiy’s office said, without giving details. A checkpoint at the Russian village of Krupets in the Kursk region came under fire, according to Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoyt. Russian gains in Donbas have come at a “significant cost” to its forces, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The International Atomic Energy Agency says it is investigating a report that a missile had flown directly over a nuclear power station, adding it would be “extremely serious” if true. The US president, Joe Biden, called for a $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, who is often seen to be voicing the Kremlin’s views, accused the US of seeking to profit from the war while indebting future generations of Ukrainians. A British citizen has been killed in Ukraine and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteer fighters. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former soldier who had served in Iraq. The UK will send 8,000 soldiers to eastern Europe on expanded exercises to combat Russian aggression, in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. The UK is also sending experts to help Ukraine with gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes, with a team expected to arrive in Poland in early May.",

                    "bodyText": "Summary It’s almost 9pm in Kyiv. Here are the day’s key events across Ukraine, Russia and beyond. Nato air forces conduct drills over Baltic Sea. Member states including the UK, Germany, Italy took part in the military training, both over water and on land, in an effort to boost eastern defences. The Netherlands increases its military support for Ukraine. Prime minister Mark Rutte also announced new sanctions in response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The US pledges to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. The UK announces 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. Germany debates whether it should grant asylum to Russian war refuseniks. The country is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but each case would be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog says it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency head met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences are in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warns. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. A Russian man shoots the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Long queues of vehicles form at the border crossing between Russia and Mongolia as people continue to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag said more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy vows to liberate the entire country as Russia presses on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. The UK’s chief of defence staff hosted talks with the Russian defence attaché at the Ministry of Defence in London. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin and Colonel Maxim Elovik met as part of ongoing efforts to “strengthen military to military channels of communication” with Russia. A number of Nato member states have begun to conduct air force drills in the Baltic Sea. Over the next two days, air forces from the UK, Germany, Italy and others will take part in military training both over water and on land in an effort to boost eastern defences. “For the first time we are including both air- and surface-based integrated air and missile defence activities in our drills,” said exercise planner Squadron Leader Craig Docker from Combined Air Operations Centre Uedem. “This underlines how the allies are shielding the eastern flank and – at the same time – prepare for meaningful execution of NATO’s deter and defence concept in the Baltic region.” The Netherlands will increase its military support for Ukraine as well as impose new sanctions against Russia, its prime minister has said. Following a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Mark Rutte announced he would step up the response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The announcement came following a pledge from the US to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken has said. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – has previously criticised those who opposed the war “Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,” he said, in his first address since the mobilisation order. “The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.” “But at the same time, the Church realises that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath, goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. “They will have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.” A suspected mass grave in an industrial chicken farm in Kharkiv is being investigated by Ukrainian forces, local officials have said. It is feared up to 100 bodies were buried in the site which was once used by Russian troops to shelter their tanks. The area was recaptured by Ukrainian soldiers who pushed Russian forces back over the border earlier this month, however demining teams have yet to sweep the area for unexploded shells. Summary It’s a little past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The UK announced 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said he met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warned. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said no decisions have yet been made on closing Russian borders. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Oleksandr Stryuk accused pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs. The UK has announced a package of sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The 92 sanctions target those behind the sham votes across the four Ukrainian regions, as well as individuals that continue to prop up Russia’s war. Among the 33 officials being sanctioned over the referendums are Sergei Yeliseyev, the head of the recently installed government in Kherson, Ivan Kusov, the minister of education and science in the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, and Yevhen Balytskyi, the supposed head of government in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia. Sanctions have also been placed on oligarchs – including the “kings of Russian real estate” God Nisanov and Zarakh Iliev – with a net worth totalling £6.3bn, and board members from state organisations. “Sham referendums held at the barrel of a gun cannot be free or fair and we will never recognise their results. They follow a clear pattern of violence, intimidation, torture, and forced deportations in the areas of Ukraine Russia has seized,” the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said. Russia’s Tass news agency is carrying some additional quotes from Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, in which he suggests he will hold a national consultation in Hungary on whether the EU should continue sanctions against Russia. It quotes Orbán saying: The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions. National consultations will be launched, within which the Hungarian people will be able to express their opinion whether they support them and whether they are in favour of introducing new ones. Tass reports that Orbán stressed he was in favour of “immediate peace talks and a ceasefire” between Ukraine and the Russian forces that invaded the country on 24 February. This is a reminder that later today the Guardian is hosting a livestream event featuring historian Timothy Snyder in conversation with the Guardian’s foreign correspondent Luke Harding talking about how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. The event starts at 8pm BST, and you can find more details and book tickets here. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has posted to Telegram decrying what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Stating it was “not a referendum”, Stryuk wrote: Realising that even this will not work and local residents will refuse to ‘vote’, the occupiers brought several buses of people from Crimea to Melitopol and Berdyansk the day before. They were supposed to help create an image for propagandist media. He went on to say: Another way of agitating people is intimidation, bullying, humiliation. During the period of martial law, 515 people were abducted, more than 200 of them still remain hostages. Also, the enemy continues to shell our free territory. The occupier creates unbearable living conditions for the civilian population by attacking power stations and social infrastructure. Do not respond to fakes and provocations of the occupiers. Let’s hold on! Believe in armed forces of Ukraine! The claims have not been independently verified. Mykhailo Fedorov, who is digital minister in Ukraine, has posted an image of telecommunications repair work being carried out in “recently liberated territories of Kharkiv region”. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he met the foreign minister from both countries at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility of a protection zone. “This must be done, and I am ready to continue these consultations in both countries so we can protect this plant,” he said. “The work there will allow us to stabilise the situation that is simply unacceptable. And I’m convinced that it’s something we can do. He insisted there must be an end to the war and the IAEA must do everything in its power to prevent a nuclear accident that “would add tragedy to the suffering”. Germany is furiously debating whether, and if so, under what conditions, it should be giving asylum to some of the tens of thousands of Russian war refuseniks, conscientious objectors and deserters who are seeking asylum abroad. Interior minister Nancy Faeser said Germany is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters from anywhere in the world who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but that cases would have to be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. Experts are warning of the high likelihood that agents of the federal security service, FSB – successor to the KGB – might use the opportunity to infiltrate the country. Security expert Christoph de Vries has warned Vladimir Putin might use this chance to try to smuggle large numbers of Russian agents into Germany, but asylum experts have also urged the government to be wary of the fact that those who refuse to fight face persecution at home. The interior ministry has also been keen to point out that this legislation, recently introduced by the EU, will protect Germany from a huge flow of Russians entering the country. Berlin is keen for there to be a joint European stance, not least wary of the fact that if it officially signals its readiness to give asylum to Russian males, it could be inundated with hundreds of thousands of them and their families. Other European countries, such as Poland, have refused to do so, while Latvia and Estonia have introduced a ban on Russians entering their countries, and Finland is in the process of doing so, after 20,000 reportedly crossed over the border at the weekend. Slovakia meanwhile, has said it will decide very carefully on a case by case basis. Russian sanctions imposed by the European Union have backfired leading to increasing energy prices, Hungary’s prime minister has said. Criticising the action taken by the west, Viktor Orbán said it was no surprise governments across Europe were falling apart – in particular Italy, where far-right leader Giorgia Meloni is on course to become the country’s first female prime minister. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, the US has warned. While announcing the mobilisation of reservists last week, Vladimir Putin again warned nuclear arms were a possibility prompting the US to send back a private warning of its own. “We have been very clear with the Russians, publicly as well as privately, to stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons,” secretary of state Antony Blinken told CBS. “It is very important that Moscow hears from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear. “Any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic effects for the country using them but for many others as well.” Ukraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The latest moves came as it was reported that Russia has also closed its border to occupied areas of Ukraine with the neighbouring Rostov region for entry and exit ordering locals to appear at military enlistment offices within three days The first wave of Russian conscripts have begun arriving for training in Russia amid widespread scepticism among outside western analysts over what impact the call up was likely to have on Russian capabilities in Ukraine. Following Ukraine’s success in retaking thousands of square kilometres of territory in the Kharkiv region, heavy fighting was reported on Monday morning including in the area of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Unconfirmed reports in the past 24 hours described Russian lines collapsing in some areas while video posted on social media was described as showing Ukrainian armour moving through at least one former Russian position littered with burned out vehicles. “The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted [Russian] troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation,” said the UK MoD. The US based Institute for the Study of War was also highly dubious about how the likely effectiveness of the Russian mobilisation. Noting that the Kremlin “is unlikely to overcome fundamental structural challenges”. Decisions are yet to be made on whether to close Russia’s borders amid long queues of vehicles waiting to leave the country, the Kremlin has said. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. In a call with reporters, spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged some call-ups had been issued in error, and that mistakes would be corrected. A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Pro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widelycondemned referendum being held in the region. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” Ukraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is meeting Putin on Monday in Sochi. Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine, according to a report from Reuters. Sandu said there was a risk that some people with dual Moldovan and Russian citizenship could be called up to fight. “To prevent that happening, we are analysing the possibility of applying the process of revoking Moldovan citizenship for those people (with Russian passports) who fight on the side of the aggressor,” Sandu said. “We are also looking at the possibility of making punishment harsher for Moldovan citizens (without Russian passports) … who are in the ranks of the aggressor’s armed forces,” she said. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Ukraine’s authorities have described the process as a “propaganda show” and it is unlikely that the results will be recognised as official, or that the referendums will be deemed to have been free or fair in many places outside of the Russian Federation. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The agency quotes him also saying it is necessary to increase the fine for evading a summons from 3,000 to 50,000 roubles. Here is an image that has been issued of the meeting between Vladimir Putin and the Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi in Russia. There are some quite punchy quotes being attributed to Lukashenko about the reports of an exodus of young men from Russia over the partial mobilisation that was announced last week. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Reuters reports Prigozhin said in a statement from his company that he founded the group in order to send fighters to Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. He said: “From that moment, on 1 May 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later acquired the name BTG Wagner.” Prigozhin, dubbed “Putin’s chef” because of his Kremlin catering contracts, has previously denied links with Wagner. Last month, Pjotr Sauer reported for the Guardian how the group had become prominent during Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. In an overnight interview broadcast by CBS in the US, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Reuters quotes him telling viewers in the US: “Today I received more information. They found two more mass graves, big graves with hundreds of people. We’re talking about (the) little town of Izium.” Last week, Ukrainian authorities finished exhuming the bodies of 436 people in a mass grave in the town. The regional governor said the majority of them appeared to have died violent deaths, and there were preliminary indications that 30 of them had been tortured.” Reuters has a quick snap that state media in Belarus are reporting that the Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. Russia used Belarus as a staging post for its latest invasion of Ukraine. In February 2022, despite Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that Russian troops would be “pulled back to their permanent bases” after the conclusion of joint military drills with Belarus, Moscow instead launched its failed attempt to take Kyiv. Two days ago, Lukashenko appeared to rule out mobilisation in Belarus, saying: “The mobilisation is in Russia … there will be no mobilisation (here).” Gen Sir Richard Barrons, former commander joint forces command in the British army, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning in the UK. He told viewers that Russia’s newly mobilised recruits “won’t be very well trained and probably not very well equipped”, and that “they won’t necessarily be very enthusiastic”. He said: “Russia would have to invest in training and equipping these large numbers of people that would take them well into next year. And it just doesn’t look like they have the training machinery, the logistics, or the weapons to make this really work anytime soon.” On the battlefield, he said the approaching winter weather would make an impact, explaining: “It gets wet in October, which means that moving tanks and trucks and big loads of artillery ammunition becomes harder and slower. “And then as the cold comes in, simply living in the field is harder. Shorter hours of daylight mean something simple like using drones that don’t have night vision capability becomes more restricted. The weather will slow things down. But the war won’t stop just because it gets cold.” He was dismissive that the widely derided referendums being carried out would make a strategic difference to Ukraine, saying: “The key question though, is whether [the Ukrainians] can sustain that forward movement in the north and the south.” He added “[The referendum] is just a device that allows [Russia] to claim that this territory, this part of Ukraine is somehow now magicked into Russia, and therefore could be protected by the full force of the Russian state. It is going to make no difference to what Ukraine does. It should make no difference to what the west does in supporting Ukraine.” Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region. It said on Telegram: They staged another performance near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, pretending to be the staff of the nuclear plant as invited mobsters. A large group of men in civilian clothes waited for the end of the shift at the station and mingled with its staff who were leaving after the shift. Along the way, those lined up gave interviews to pro-Russian propaganda media and shouted words of support for Russia and the pseudo-referendum, after which they went to the bus in which the “voting” was held and demonstratively filled out the ballots. This fact once again proves that among the patriotic workers of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, no one volunteered to participate in the occupying farce, so the propagandists were once again forced to make a “good” picture for Russian customers. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image from inside occupied Mariupol, which shows the city’s mayor imposed by Russian authorities, Konstantin Ivashchenko, alongside an armed guard as “voting” takes place in the open air in the city. Andrew Roth reports for the Guardian from Moscow: A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. There are conflicting reports about whether the commandant, who also heads the local draft board, has died. Video showed him being carried from the building and placed on to a stretcher. He was not moving in the video. The Irkutsk regional governor, Igor Kobzev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the draft office head was in hospital in a critical condition, and that the detained shooter “will absolutely be punished”. According to a witness, the man shot the military commandant after he had given a “clumsy” pep talk for the men to go and fight in Ukraine. “Nobody is going to go anywhere,” the man said moments before opening fire, a witness told the Baikal People news outlet. It is the latest incident tied to Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Russian men receiving their call-up papers. A half-dozen draft centres have been torched in arson attacks in the last week, and police made hundreds of arrests across the country in order to disperse local protests sparked by the announcement. Alex Rossi is the Sky News correspondent in Moscow. He has offered this analysis this morning, saying: We’re now five days into this [mobilisation]. It doesn’t seem to really have gone down very well. Bear in mind that Russia, of course, is a very heavily securitised police state where dissent isn’t tolerated, but there have been sporadic protests all over the country. The number of people that they’re trying to draft is 300,000. That’s almost double the initial invasion force. So it is a reflection of how badly things are going on the battlefield for the Kremlin, and just shows that they have a very significant manpower problem. How these protests continue, we don’t know whether they will grow, there’s certainly the possibility of a really significant domestic backlash. Although they are small, it is significant that they’re happening at all, and that will be a serious worry for Vladimir Putin going forward. The Tass news agency is reporting that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station for the widely-derided referendum being held there by proxy Russian authorities has had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s RIA Novosti agency is carrying a quote from Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders of the Russian-imposed administration in the occupied Kherson region. It reports he says he anticipates Kherson becoming part of the Russian Federation at the earliest opportunity, saying: My personal opinion: this will happen in the near future, because the sooner we become part of the Russian Federation, becoming a full-fledged subject, the sooner we will be able to establish a peaceful life. The “referendums” organised by the occupying authorities in eastern Ukraine continue today. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram of damage caused overnight in his region by Russian shelling. He claims that an attack was made on an industrial zone on the outskirts of the city and that more than 15 houses and a school were damaged in one village, while one two-story residential building and an agricultural enterprise in another were hit. No casualties have been recorded overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Reuters reported that Japan also added 21 Russian organisations, such as science labs, to the list of entities subject to export bans. “Japan is deeply concerned about the possibility of nuclear weapons used during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Matsuno told media, adding Japan will continue to work with the international society in supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia. The news that Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in Italy’s elections, putting her on course to create the most rightwing government since the end of the second world war, is unlikely to be welcomed by Paris or Brussels. They are seeking to keep Europe united in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Meloni has condemned Russia’s invasion and supported sending weapons to Ukraine, but it remains unclear whether her government will back the eighth round of EU sanctions being discussed in Brussels. Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League forms part of her coalition, has claimed the sanctions were bringing Italy to its knees. However, he never blocked any EU measures against Russia when in Mario Draghi’s broad coalition government, which collapsed in July. The initial tranches of men called up under Russia’s partial mobilisation have started arriving at military bases, according to the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update. Many tens of thousands of call-up papers have been issued, according to UK MoD, which said Russia will faces an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops. Here is the UK analysis: Unlike most western armies, the Russian military provides low-level, initial training to soldiers within their designated operational units, rather than in dedicated training establishments. Typically, one battalion within each Russian brigade will remain in garrison if the other two deploy and can provide a cadre of instructors to train new recruits or augmentees. However, Russia has deployed many of these third battalions to Ukraine. Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years. The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the frontline with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate. The US has warned Russia privately of “catastrophic” consequences if it uses nuclear weapons, US officials said. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a thinly veiled threat to use nuclear arms in a speech last week as he announced the mobilization of reservists. “It’s very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear,” Blinken said of Putin’s comments as he spoke to the CBS News program “60 Minutes”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition, according to a report by Reuters. “As a result of a large-scale fire and the detonation of ammunition, the evacuation of the civilian population was organised,” the South command of Ukraine’s forces said in a statement on the Telegram. “Preliminarily, there have been no casualties.” It’s just past 8.10am in Ukraine. Here are the latest developments: The United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser said. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.” Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Zelenskiy has renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine has received Nasams (national advance surface-to-air missile systems) air defence missiles from the US. In a TV interview, Zelenskiy thanked President Joe Biden and confirmed that Ukraine now had the systems in the country. Zelenskiy also said Russia’s military call-up was a tacit acknowledgment that its “army is not able to fight”. Thousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air. The pilgrims, many travelling from Israel and farther afield, converged on the small city of Uman, the burial site of Nachman of Breslov, a respected Hassidic rabbi who died in 1810, Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needed “much more” help from the UK as the country fought Moscow’s invasion, with the Kremlin’s military call-up amounting to “something formidable”. Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients would arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, envoy Michael Brodsky said. Aiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia last week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog”.",

Many of them rent, with homeownership largely out of reach for those without family wealth due to steep rises of property prices, while wages remain stagnant. There’s also rising living costs, which renders consuming the daily recommended vegetable and fruit intake a luxury. This is a demographic that is being closely watched in Victoria as the state heads to the polls in November. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will say he’s got far too much to do than spend time analysing what the federal result means for the upcoming state poll – his usual refrain is that elections are “always close” with a “handful of votes and a handful of seats” determining the outcome. But he’s spent years courting the Millennial and Gen Z vote, largely by bypassing the media and communicating with them directly via social media. Andrews has even posted a Drake meme on Facebook then told reporters he didn’t know of the Canadian rapper’s songs. Most of his government’s recent announcements seem to be geared towards this cohort, including the introduction of an affirmative consent model, a landmark festival to celebrate LGBTIQ+ Victorians, a two-year trial of paid sick leave for casuals and free kinder.

The plan involves several initiatives, including capping rent increases in line with wage growth, establishing a housing ombudsman and better regulating estate agents. The Greens have also vowed to end new coal and gas projects in the state and move to 100% renewable energy by 2030, build more social housing, increase funding for the corruption watchdog and ban political donations from property developers, fossil fuel companies and gambling – all similar policies to ones that helped the teals and Greens sweep the federal election. They’re also looking to double representation by winning Albert Park, Northcote and Richmond in the lower house and the southern metropolitan region in the upper house. Climate 200, which provided crucial funding for the federal teals, last month polled Victorian voters and found potential support for similar independents in the Liberal-held seats of Brighton, Caulfield, Kew and Sandringham, and the Labor seat of Hawthorn. Independent candidates are also expected to stand in Benambra and the south-west coast, both held by the Liberals, and several Labor seats including Melton and Werribee. There is also a large field of micro-parties contesting upper house. The Coalition, meanwhile, announced last month it will legislate an emission reduction target of 50% by 2030 as well as a pathway to net zero by 2050, bringing it in line with Labor, in a move designed to secure support in inner-urban electorates. But its pledges to support LGBTIQ+ Victorians were affected by the Liberals’ preselection of Moira Deeming as an upper house candidate. The opposition’s integrity policy also came spectacularly undone by revelations leader Matthew Guy’s former chief of staff sought funds inappropriately. Labor has also endured several scandals since coming into office. Whether their policy pledges will be seen as cynical attempts to stop young people abandoning major parties in November remains to be seen.",

Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, Russian-installed regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky said that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration.

The plant has provided about 1,000 well-paid jobs and half the town’s tax revenue. A lengthy decommissioning process will cut jobs by two-thirds.</p> <p>“It’s a sad day, the end of an era, and it marks the loss of our largest employer and tax payer,” the mayor of Buchanan, Theresa Knickerbocker, told the Guardian.</p> <p>“I think people really didn’t understand nuclear and I’m hugely disappointed that a clean energy plant is being replaced by two gas plants. We talk about the environment and that’s not environmentally sound.”</p> <p>As the Biden administration pushes for a non-fossil fuel-dependent energy policy, there will inevitably be a period in which more electricity is produced using gas-powered systems, before wind and solar take up the slack.</p> <p>In the long battle over Indian Point, some have seen signs of political meddling. In 2017, the group Environmental Progress <a href=\"https://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/1/6/natural-gas-promotor-at-center-of-new-york-corruption-scandal-pushed-to-close-indian-point-nuclear-plant\">noted</a> that two former Cuomo aides worked with a natural gas company, Competitive Power Ventures.

Fossil fuels accounted for 67% of all state production.</p> <p>“We’re going in the wrong direction,” said Pramila Malick, an activist with the group, adding that closing Indian Point and ramping up generation from fracked gas will increase state greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.</p> <p>“The community is being poisoned by particulates,” Malick said.</p> <p>Unions also oppose the closure. James Shillitto, president of UWUA Local 1-2, said it had “no upside, only downside”.</p> <p>“The governor’s for renewable energy,” he said, “which we support.

So with the closure of this plant today we’re 1,000 megawatts in the hole. This closure is about fear, unrealistic fear, of a nuclear accident. The history here shows that after 58 years we haven’t had problems.”</p> <p>Critics have pointed to a safety history that includes faulty reactor bolts and radioactive tritium in groundwater onsite.

                    "bodyText": "America’s energy past and future was on display on Friday at Indian Point, a nuclear plant 25 miles north of New York City that has been producing electricity since 1962. At 11am the last of the ageing plant’s reactor turbines shut down, ending a long political standoff. At the same time, wind and sun over the Hudson River alongside the plant pointed to the state’s energy future. Environmentalists and politicians have described the plant as a threat to millions. Many welcomed the closure. “There are 20 million people living within 50 miles of Indian Point and there is no way to evacuate them in case of a radiological release,” Paul Gallay, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper, told the Associated Press. In part, the plant was doomed by the attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 – the pilots of the hijacked planes used the river for navigation, alerting politicians to the vulnerability of the reactors on the banks of the Hudson. “The plant was built to withstand an airplane crash in the 70s,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said recently. “Who knows what would happen now with Indian Point?” Furthermore, nuclear power has lost favour as the cost of clean-energy renewables declines. In 2019, Indian Point provided 13% of New York state power. According to operator Entergy, for New York City and the lower Hudson Valley that figure was about 25%. Under a 2017 agreement between Cuomo, Riverkeeper and Entergy, another reactor was shut down a year ago. On Friday in the town of Buchanan, the mood was dark. The plant has provided about 1,000 well-paid jobs and half the town’s tax revenue. A lengthy decommissioning process will cut jobs by two-thirds. “It’s a sad day, the end of an era, and it marks the loss of our largest employer and tax payer,” the mayor of Buchanan, Theresa Knickerbocker, told the Guardian. “I think people really didn’t understand nuclear and I’m hugely disappointed that a clean energy plant is being replaced by two gas plants. We talk about the environment and that’s not environmentally sound.” As the Biden administration pushes for a non-fossil fuel-dependent energy policy, there will inevitably be a period in which more electricity is produced using gas-powered systems, before wind and solar take up the slack. In the long battle over Indian Point, some have seen signs of political meddling. In 2017, the group Environmental Progress noted that two former Cuomo aides worked with a natural gas company, Competitive Power Ventures. The episode was detailed in a federal indictment filed by the then US attorney for the southern district in Manhattan. “Based on my review of publicly available documents and my interviews of witnesses, including employees of [Competitive Power Ventures], the importance of the [CPV Valley Energy Center] to the state depended at least in part, on whether [Indian Point] was going to be shut down,” Preet Bharara wrote. According to Nuclear New York, a group opposing closure, Indian Point produced 81% of downstate clean energy, with solar and hydro making up 2% and 4%. Fossil fuels accounted for 67% of all state production. “We’re going in the wrong direction,” said Pramila Malick, an activist with the group, adding that closing Indian Point and ramping up generation from fracked gas will increase state greenhouse gas emissions by 10%. “The community is being poisoned by particulates,” Malick said. Unions also oppose the closure. James Shillitto, president of UWUA Local 1-2, said it had “no upside, only downside”. “The governor’s for renewable energy,” he said, “which we support. [It] is not going to happen with a magic wand. There isn’t a piece of equipment in the water for offshore wind and there isn’t any utility-scale solar built yet.” More than 20 large-scale renewable energy projects will be under construction this year. Cuomo has promised 70% renewables by 2030 and 100% a decade later. “There are many hurdles to get that done,” Shillitto said. “Nimbyism is going to slow it down. So with the closure of this plant today we’re 1,000 megawatts in the hole. This closure is about fear, unrealistic fear, of a nuclear accident. The history here shows that after 58 years we haven’t had problems.” Critics have pointed to a safety history that includes faulty reactor bolts and radioactive tritium in groundwater onsite. Groups like Riverkeeper say Indian Point kills fish by taking in river water for cooling. Greg Jaczko, head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Barack Obama and a lecturer at Princeton, told the Guardian the carbon-free energy future will be “exclusively non-nuclear”. “The nuclear industry failed to become a viable solution for carbon-free electricity generation,” he said, noting that of four Obama-era approved plants, two have been abandoned and two are behind schedule and over-budget. “Nuclear is an expensive way to generate carbon-free electricity when there are viable new alternatives. It’s cheaper today to build out renewable generation than it is to continue to operate 40-year-old nuclear power plants.” But Jaczko did not dispute that fossil-fuel generation will increase in the short term. “There may be a period when the overall supply of electricity will see an increased dependence on natural gas,” he said, “but in the long term the trend is to reduce emissions significantly.” Indian Point now faces a 12-year, $2.3bn decommissioning run, subject to approval, by New Jersey-based Holtec International. In 2014, the company was cited by the Guardian for donations to Republican coffers after being granted significant subsidies by the state’s then governor, Chris Christie. According to Jaczko, decommissioning could present problems given the age of the plant and the propensity for reactors in general to present surprises. “My biggest concern is that sufficient resources are set aside because it’s not a revenue-generating business,” he said. “If existing funds do not cover that cost, or it’s not done right, you could end up looking to taxpayers to foot the bill.”",

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came on the same day that 12 civilians were reportedly wounded when a Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey residential building in Voznesensk, about 19 miles (30km) from the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant. He added that a young girl had lost an eye as a result of the attack on Saturday. While there was no apparent major damage after the reported unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack on Sevastopol, which has not been independently verified by the Guardian, observers said it demonstrated Ukraine’s ability to strike deep behind Russian lines at prestige targets. Video shared on Twitter appeared to show Russian air defences attempting to destroy the UAV and dark plumes of smoke rising from the city. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Sevastopol’s governor, wrote on Telegram that a drone had hit the roof of the headquarters on Saturday and said there were no casualties, reports the Russian news agency Tass. “I am at the [Black Sea] fleet’s headquarters now. A drone hit the roof here 25 minutes ago. Unfortunately, it was not downed … There are no casualties,” he wrote. Later on Saturday, Crimea’s governor, Sergei Aksyonov, contradicted the earlier statement by saying on Telegram that local air defences shot down the drone above the Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. “Air defense systems successfully hit all targets over the territory over Crimea on Saturday morning. There are no casualties or material damage,” his boss, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram. Authorities in Sevastopol reported on Saturday night that the city’s air-defence systems had been called into action again in the evening. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry on Saturday said its forces had killed a total of 44,900 Russian personnel – a rise of 200 on the day before. On Friday, the US said for the first time that it would provide Ukraine with ScanEagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armour rounds and howitzer weapons in a new £655m aid package to help its efforts to take back Ukrainian territory. “These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table,” Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said. There was cautious optimism on Saturday as two more grain ships left the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk , bringing the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. Welcoming the sailings, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Saturday that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under the deal agreed last month. “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions,” Guterres told a news conference in Istanbul. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. Wednesday will mark six months of war in the region since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Russia has made gains in the east, it has been put on the defensive in other regions as Ukraine scales up its attacks in the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. Last week, a total of nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at a Crimean airbase. Russian leaders have warned that such strikes indicate an escalation in the conflict, powered by the US and Nato allies. In its latest intelligence update on the conflict, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) said last week that it saw “only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline”. In Donbas, it said Russian forces have approached the outskirts of Bakhmut, but have not broken into the city. In the south-west, it reported that neither Ukrainian or Russian forces had made advances on the frontline in occupied Kherson, but added: “Increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south.”",

Six hypersonic missiles, able to evade air defences, were among those launched.</p> <p><strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong> in Kyiv reported that the attacks also briefly disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – from the grid.

                    "bodyText": "Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The battle for Bakhmut rages as death toll rises Ukrainian authorities insisted they would continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, in what has become one of the longest and bloodiest battles since the war began. Despite continuing rumours that a Ukrainian retreat is imminent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy instructed the army to bolster the defence of the city, even as the death toll rises. Isobel Koshiw and Pjotr Sauer reported that Ukraine was suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Andriy, a deputy commander in the Donetsk region whose battalion is fighting in the Bakhmut area, told them that “positions are ready [for them] to retreat to. The reason they are still there is more of a political thing.” On the other side, a Moscow-based analyst with links to Russia’s ministry of defence estimated that 6,000-8,000 Russian troops had been killed, predominantly recently recruited convicts. However, the analyst noted it was very difficult to be precise because the “brunt” of the fighting was being carried out by Wagner mercenary forces. “Wagner doesn’t always retrieve the bodies of its fighters, while many of the former convicts fighting are not properly registered,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Despite the brutal conflict, many civilians remain in Bakhmut. Peter Beaumont met a police major who was attempting to persuade those caring for children to let them be evacuated. It is a search that has led to rumours that police are taking children from parents who refuse to leave, which has prompted some families to hide their sons and daughters, inexplicable as that might seem. “But it’s not correct,” the officer said. “The law says we can only take children with permission of the parents. If the children don’t have parents but have a guardian, we can get permission from social services to take them out.” Ukraine said on Tuesday that about 4,000 civilians had been killed in Bakhmut during Russia’s assault. Russia launches largest missile barrage in weeks At least nine people were reported killed on Thursday after Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions across the country were hit. At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Six hypersonic missiles, able to evade air defences, were among those launched. Lorenzo Tondo in Kyiv reported that the attacks also briefly disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – from the grid. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the plant’s safety and security. Pro-Ukraine group may have sabotaged Nord Stream European and US intelligence officials obtained tentative intelligence to suggest a pro-Ukrainian saboteur group may have been behind the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, according to reports in the New York Times and German newspaper Die Zeit. German investigators believe the attack on the pipelines was carried out by a team of six people, using a yacht that had been hired by a company registered in Poland and owned by two Ukrainian citizens, according to Die Zeit. Dan Sabbagh, Philip Oltermann and Lorenzo Tondo reported that the information was shared between European intelligence agencies in an effort to establish more information about those who carried out the undersea bombings in September, an attack that had left western governments perplexed. Details about the intelligence remains sketchy and it is unclear what confidence the US intelligence community places in the theory, as well as who may have organised, funded and directed such a daring attack on the gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany. But it is suggested that the government of Kyiv did not direct the underwater strike. An unarmed PoW was allegedly shot dead by Russians Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to “find the murderers” of an unarmed Ukrainian prisoner of war apparently shot dead by Russian troops in footage that spread rapidly across social media on Monday. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram and was widely shared on Twitter, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette. The soldier, in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm, says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Lorenzo Tondo and Pjotr Sauer reported this story. Ukraine urged the international criminal court to investigate the footage. ‘Foreign agent’ law stirs anti-Russian sentiment in Georgia After two nights of widespread, violent protests, Georgia’s ruling party withdrew a draft law that had drawn comparisons with a 2012 law in Russia that has since been used to crack down on dissent and suppress western-funded NGOs and media. Pjotr Sauer reported that the proposed “foreign agent” bill faced criticism that it would limit press freedom and undercut the country’s efforts to become a candidate for European Union membership. Across two nights hundreds of police, many carrying riot shields, used water cannon and teargas in clashes in Georgia’s capital. More than 100 protesters were arrested during this week’s protests. Thousands had marched in the streets to rally against the proposed law that would require any organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents” or face substantial fines. Speaking on Wednesday evening as the protests were continuing, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “democratic success” in Georgia and voiced gratitude for Georgian support for Ukraine. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said. Rightwing Republicans rail against US aid for Ukraine Marjorie Taylor Greene, an influential far-right Republican in the US Congress, called for the US to stop aid to Ukraine, David Smith wrote, giving added voice to a grassroots revolt in the party that threatens bipartisan support for the war against Russia. The Georgia congresswoman is a notorious provocateur who has made racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements and promoted bizarre conspiracy theories. Yet she has emerged as a prominent voice in the House of Representatives after forging a bond with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who vowed that Republicans will not write a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. Pentagon accused of blocking effort to hand Russia war crimes evidence to ICC The Pentagon was accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Julian Borger reported. The Biden White House and the state department have been a proponent of cooperation with the Hague-based ICC as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes, but the defence department is firmly opposed on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Meanwhile, the top US intelligence official said Washington did not believe the Russian military could recover from its losses in Ukraine to make territorial gains there this year, but she warned that Vladimir Putin still believed time was on his side. The assessment, presented by the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, at a Senate hearing on Wednesday morning, was noncommittal on whether Ukraine could take back significant amounts of occupied land in its planned counter-offensive this spring.

Here’s a summary of the latest news:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reported, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. </strong>Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. </strong>Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/24/poland-requests-german-permission-to-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine\">14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged</a>, the former’s prime minister has said. </strong>Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Belgium</strong> has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, <strong>Alexander De Croo,</strong> said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Rafael Grossi</strong>, head of the <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</strong>, who visited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that <strong>ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages</strong> due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. </strong>“The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lynne Tracy</strong>, the new <strong>US</strong> ambassador to <strong>Russia</strong>, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>European Union</strong> wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hungary</strong> will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, told state radio on Friday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday</strong> amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. </strong>“Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said.

                    "bodyText": "It is coming up to 7pm in London – 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest news: A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reported, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Ukraine is setting up drone assault companies within its armed forces that will be equipped with Starlink satellite communications, it has announced, as it presses ahead with an idea to build up an “army of drones”. According to Reuters, the general staff said the commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi signed off on the creation of the units in a project that will involve several ministries and agencies. “The most professional servicemen” have already been chosen to lead the companies, each of which will receive drones and ammunition, Starlink terminals and other equipment, it said on Facebook. “We are doing everything to provide soldiers with modern technologies.” Starlink is a satellite internet system operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and widely used both by civilians and the military in Ukraine. It will take about six months to train Ukrainian pilots for combat in western fighter jets, such as the US’ F-16, Kyiv has said, as it steps up its campaign to secure fourth-generation warplanes. Reuters reports that Ukraine got a huge boost this week when Germany and the US announced plans to provide heavy tanks to Kyiv, which is now hoping the west will also provide long-range missiles and fighter jets. Western military support has been vital for Kyiv and has rapidly evolved. Before the invasion, even the idea of supplying lethal aid to Ukraine was highly controversial, but western supplies have since shattered taboo after taboo. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ihnat said F-16s may be the best option for a multi-role fighter to replace the country’s current fleet of warplanes, which are older than modern Ukraine itself. He said Kyiv was using four types of Soviet-era planes. The pilots are saying it is not a problem to fly the F-16, they could learn it within several weeks. To fight with these planes is a very different thing, to use all types of weapons. Pilots say they could master it in about half a year. Ukraine uses its warplanes for intercept missions and to attack Russian positions. Germany’s €100bn (£87.7bn, $108bn) special defence fund is no longer enough to cover its needs, the country’s new defence minister Boris Pistorius has said during an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Pistorius, who took office last week after the resignation of his predecessor, said Germany would also need to raise its annual regular defence spending from the current level of around €50bn. Germany also needs to replenish its military hardware stocks, including replacements for the 14 Leopard tanks that Berlin agreed to send to Ukraine to help repel Russia’s invasion, the new defence chief said. Germany’s decision to suspend compulsory military service in 2011 was a mistake, he added, saying he was hesitant to place a burden upon young generations but was open to discussing a new model to strengthen the relationship between citizens and the state. Asked whether Germany would sent fighter jets to Ukraine, the next request from Kyiv after Germany approved earlier this week the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, Pistorius said this was “ruled out”. Fighter aircraft are much more complex systems than main battle tanks and have a completely different range and firepower. We would be venture into dimensions that I would currently warn against. Ukraine will need an additional $17bn (£13.7bn) in financing this year for energy repairs, de-mining and to rebuild infrastructure, Reuters quotes the country’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal as saying. He told a government meeting five high-voltage substations in the central, southern and south-west regions were hit during Russia’s air attacks on Thursday. The energy sector has been severely damaged following four months of Russian missile and drones attacks. Shmyhal said the government hosted a meeting with western partners this week to coordinate financial support in a transparent and efficient way. This year, we need to finance a huge budget deficit of about $38bn. Another $17bn this year will be needed for fast reconstruction of the energy, humanitarian de-mining, rebuilding of the housing, critical and social infrastructure. The government also said it was setting up a state agency for infrastructure recovery and development. Mustafa Nayem, a prominent former journalist who had been a deputy infrastructure minister since 2021, would head the newly-created agency. Moscow has ordered Latvia’s envoy to leave Russia within two weeks, the former’s foreign ministry has said – following a similar decision by Riga earlier this week, Reuters reports. The ministry said it had summoned the Latvian chargé d’affaires to protest Riga’s decision to downgrade relations with Russia. Latvia has said it acted out of solidarity with Estonia after Tallinn also ordered out Russia’s envoy. The three Baltic states, which also include Lithuania, have been among a group of Nato allies arguing strongly for more western tanks to be sent to Ukraine. A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reports, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russian military used fiercely-burning phosphorus munitions in its shelling of the village of Zvanivka, about 12 miles (20 km) north of Bakhmut; a city that has become the focus of a gruelling standoff in recent months. The shelling also damaged apartment buildings and two schools in the nearby town of Vuhledar, Kyrylenko said. The governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region Serhii Haidai said Ukrainian shelling hit two Russian bases in the occupied towns of Kreminna and Rubizhne, killing and wounding “dozens” of Russian soldiers. The AP said it could not independently verify his claim. Further south, Russian troops resumed shelling the town of Nikopol, across the river Dnieper from the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, damaging apartment buildings, gas pipelines, power lines and a bakery, the AP quoted officials as saying. A senior EU official has called for a “Radio Free Russia” to help independent Russian media distribute content in their home country and evade heavy censorship. Vĕra Jourová, the European Commission vice-president in charge of values and transparency, said the EU had a moral duty to support democratic ideals in Russia: We should not give up on the Russian society … regardless of how few or how many want to hear the real news, not Kremlin propaganda. During a speech at Estonia’s foreign ministry, Jourová called for a Radio Free Russia project to support independent Russian media that have been expelled or fled their home country. The project did not mean establishing a new radio station, she said, but supporting journalists in the EU, so they could “produce more content and distribute it more widely without any editorial interference”. She added: We need to create the conditions for them to work and tell the story of the EU they see and experience to their Russian audiences. It is not only a moral duty, it is in our self-interest. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m/$104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. In a press conference the prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. VRT, the public service broadcaster for Belgium’s Flemish community reports: Federal defence minister Ludivine Dedonder gave details about the nature of the military aid that Belgium is giving to Ukraine. This will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Some of this will come from stocks held by the Belgian army, while the rest will be bought from Belgian arms manufacturers. Dedonder would not go into specific details about the quantities of arms that will be sent. The defence minister went on to say that armoured jeeps and lorries will also be given to the Ukrainians. All of the vehicles that will be sent to Ukraine are all in working order and in a good state of repair or will soon undergo a full service. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. Pompeyo Gonzalez Pascual is under formal investigation over two possible aggravated terrorism charges and four terrorism charges, the magistrate said during his first court hearing. Reuters reports he was ordered to be detained pending any formal charges and further hearings. The suspect used Russian messaging apps such as VK and the Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service Protonmail, which could indicate a risk of him fleeing to Russia, the magistrate added. The evidence suggests Gonzalez acted alone, the judge wrote. He said the suspect’s alleged actions showed his intent to give the impression they were carried out by people with ties with Russia as retribution for Spain’s and the United States’ support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of the country. “There is no indication that the person under investigation belongs to or collaborates with any terrorist gang or organised group,” the statement said. Ukraine’s ruling party has kicked out a lawmaker as reports he travelled to Thailand during the war spark a public outcry. Mykola Tyshchenko was expelled from Servant of the People’s voting bloc after an announcement appeared briefly on the website of the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand saying he would meet members of the diaspora at a hotel there, according to the party’s spokesperson Yulia Paliychuk. Tyshchenko said on Facebook he had been on a business trip in Asia with approval of party leaders, “acting exclusively in the interests of Ukraine”. Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said he had approved no such trip. According to Reuters, the winter visit to south-east Asia came amid a crackdown by the president Volodymyr Zelenskiy aimed at projecting an image of greater accountability for officials. More than a dozen senior officials were fired or resigned this week – including a deputy prosecutor who had come under fire in the press for a holiday in Spain – in the biggest shakeup of the Kyiv leadership since the war began. Zelenskiy has announced a ban this week on private trips abroad by officials. Most Ukrainian men aged 18-60 have already been barred from leaving the country under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February last year. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday. Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful. The information could not be independently verified. Russia has said its forces have made significant advances in the region in the last six days but UK military intelligence poured doubt on the claims in a briefing on Friday. It was suggested the Russians may have “conducted local, probing attacks” but added that it was “highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances”. No evidence was provided for the UK military intelligence statement. Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Warsaw, which has positioned itself as one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies, has pressed hard for Germany to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and to allow other countries to do so as well; a demand to which Berlin agreed on Wednesday. Now, Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News: Poland sent 250 tanks as the first country half a year ago or even more than that. Right now, we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said. Reuters reports the ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows because of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. She said she thought it would be progress if US-Russia relations did not sour even further, but said Moscow did not believe it would be possible to prevent a further deterioration. Last week, the Kremlin dismissed the idea that Washington and Moscow could turn their relationship around halfway through the US president Joe Biden’s term in office, adding that there was “no hope” for improvement in the foreseeable future. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information, the state-run Tass news agency reports. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies and relayed by Reuters, it said: Roskomnadzor has restricted access to a number of resources belonging to state structures of hostile countries for disseminating material aimed at destabilising the social and political situation in Russia. Tass quotes Roskomnadzor as saying the two US websites have published inaccurate material and information that had discredited the Russian armed forces. There was no immediate comment from Washington or from the US embassy in Moscow. Reuters noted that the reports were produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of the military operations in Ukraine. Russia has made it a criminal offence to discredit its armed forces, a crime punishable by up to five years in jail, while knowingly distributing “false information” about the military carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. Since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year, Roskomnadzor has blocked a host of independent media outlets, some foreign news websites and social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm ahead of the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine – a former Soviet republic and Moscow satellite that has sought to join the EU and Nato in recent years. Kyiv reports heavy fighting in the east of the country on Friday, capping a week when the west promised to provide Ukraine with modern battlefield tanks for the first time to help it fight back against Moscow. Reuters quotes Ireland’s Simon Harris as saying: There absolutely will have to be accountability for horrific international crimes and the brutality of what we’re seeing in Ukraine ... the clear and apparent war crimes. The ministers discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said: Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable. The question is, how can we deal with this in a practical and efficient way. As the 27 EU countries debated the options, the Slovak minister spoke against starting a new body to carry out prosecutions, something his Belgian colleague Vincent van Quickenborne specifically called for. The latter was quoted as saying: These acts of aggression should be condemned not only by European countries or by the United States, but by a large majority of countries ... in Africa, Latin America and other places. The European Union hopes South Africa will use its good relations with Russia to convince it to stop the war in Ukraine, Reuters quotes the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as saying. Speaking alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in the capital Pretoria, he told reporters: The EU isn’t asking South Africa to choose sides, just asking countries across the world to stand with the UN charter. The EU considers South Africa an important partner in the rules-based international order, he added. Pandor said: It is not just South Africa and other African countries that must play a role at seeking peace. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has repeatedly sought to make clear that Nato must not become party to the war in Ukraine, says a ministry spokesperson, in response to uproar over a comment she made earlier in the week about fighting against Russia. At an event in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Baerbock said in English: “We are fighting a war against Russia, and not against each other.” Now, Reuters quotes the German ministry as saying: Russian propaganda continually takes statements, sentences, stances, positions of the government, our partners and uses them to serve their purposes. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Lavrov has been on a week-long charm offensive on the continent, starting in South Africa, which is planning joint military drills with Russia and China, and finishing off with a surprise trip to the reclusive Horn of Africa nation of Eritrea. South Africa is one of Russia’s most important allies on a continent divided over the invasion and western attempts to isolate Moscow because of its military actions. Eritrea is one of the few African countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine; although many abstained. hee Russian state news agency Tass quotes Lavrov as saying: We are thankful to Eritrean friends for their consistent support of Russian initiatives in the UN. He said Asmara had taken a “principled and balanced position on issues regarding the events in Ukraine and around it”, TASS reports, adding that he also invited his Eritrean counterpart, Osman Saleh, to visit Moscow soon. The talks in Eritrea also explored ways of enhancing ties in energy, mining, information technology, education and health, the information minister Yemane Meskel says. Both sides will conduct a joint study to establish the logistical and transit opportunities presented by the Red Sea port of Massawa and its airport, Tass reports, quoting Lavrov as saying: I would like to mention the possibility of using the logistical potential of the Massawa port and the city’s airport. The airport of Massawa looks interesting from the point of view of its transit possibilities. Lavrov’s visit to Africa coincides with others by senior US officials, who are crisscrossing the continent to shore up ties with its allies there. Speaking when he met Lavrov’s delegation on Thursday, the foreign minister Osman blamed the crisis in Ukraine on what he described as the United States’ “reckless policy of hegemony and containment” over several decades, Reuters reports. The sad fact is that Ukraine is both a pretext and victim of this policy. There was no mention of the conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, where Eritrean troops fought alongside their Ethiopian federal counterparts against rebellious Tigrayan forces. A deal to end the fighting was signed last November but Eritrea was not party to the truce. Eritrean troops have started to leave some parts of Tigray, witnesses said. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that 10 regions of Ukraine are using emergency power due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key.

More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Kevin Rawlinson will be with you for the next few hours. Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk said on Friday it “hurts a lot” to see Russian flags at the Australian Open despite the ban on them and was surprised by the lapse in security that allowed spectators to display the flags in and around Melbourne Park. Novak Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, said earlier on Friday he would not attend his son’s semi-final against Tommy Paul after a video emerged showing him posing at Melbourne Park with fans holding Russian flags. “It hurts a lot because there were specific rules, they were printed out outside that this is not allowed to bring flags,” Reuters reports Kostyuk told reporters after bowing out of the women’s doubles competition with Elena-Gabriela Ruse. “It’s not impossible, but you’re not allowed to bring out the flags and so on. It really hurts that they were there for quite some time. “They were there on the court, in the stands as well and I just don’t understand as well. It really hurts and I don’t understand how this can be possible.” Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief told Reuters in an interview. Speaking at the UNHCR offices in Kyiv following a six-day tour of the country, Filippo Grandi said Ukraine’s president had asked his agency to “do more” to help children from occupied regions to whom this was happening. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. “We are seeking access all the time, and access has been rather rare, sporadic and not unfettered, if you see what I mean.” Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. “We categorically reject unfounded allegations that the Russian authorities are kidnapping children,” Russian diplomat at the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said in July. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. It writes: According to the official Telegram channel of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation “Step-by-step synchronisation of Russian legislation continues after the admission of four new entities to it. In the near future, the Dontesk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will become part of the second time zone, where Moscow time operates,” the message says. The relevant bill has already been submitted to the government of the Russian Federation. “Recall that earlier all four regions lived according to Kyiv time, UTC + 2 (one hour less than in Moscow) and UTC + 3 in the summer. Currently, Moscow time de facto operates in the new regions, and the new bill fixes this. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” Reuters reports he added. Here are some images of people ice fishing in Ukraine’s occupied region of Luhansk, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on the latest energy situation. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Currently, ten regions of Ukraine are already using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after yesterday’s Russian shelling, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday, Reuters reports. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. “Work is currently underway on further possible steps and first steps to continue sanctions and prevent Russians and Belarusians from international competitions,” he said. “If we are not heard, I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a message to his official Telegram channel on Holocaust Memorial day. 27 January marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the message, Ukraine’s president writes: Today, as always, Ukraine honors the memory of millions of victims of the Holocaust. We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only. That is why it is so important that everyone who values life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Stefano Sannino, secretary general of the European Union’s European external action service, has defended German and US provisions of military equipment to Ukraine, and criticised Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for waging a war on Nato and the west. Associated Press report that Sannino, speaking at a news conference in Tokyo as part of an Asia-Pacific tour, said Putin had “moved from a concept of special operation to a concept now of a war against Nato and the west.” He said German and US tank provisions are meant to help Ukrainians defend themselves in the war, rather than making them attackers. “I think that this latest development in terms of armed supply is just an evolution of the situation and of the way Russia started moving the war into a different stage,” Sannino said. He added that Russia is making “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians and cities and no longer military targets. The EU is not moving the war into a different stage but is “just giving the possibility of saving lives and allowing the Ukrainians to defend from these barbaric attacks,” Sannino said. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that the night passed in Sumy region without any shelling. The UK’s ministry of defence has published its latest intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation in Ukraine. It casts doubt on recent Russian claims of military advances in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, writing: Over the last six days, Russian online commentators have claimed Russian forces have made significant advances, breaking through Ukrainian defences in two areas: in Zaporizhzhia Oblast near Orikiv, and 100km to the east, in Donetsk Oblast, near Vuhledar. Russian units have probably conducted local, probing attacks near Orikiv and Vuhledar, but it is highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances. There is a realistic possibility that Russian military sources are deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the Russian operation is sustaining momentum. The claim is presented on social media without any supporting evidence being published. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Oleskandr Musiyenko, head of the Military and Strategic Research Centre of Ukraine, says Russia is sending in more reinforcements to block Ukrainian advances. “They are mostly sending infantry and artillery forces into battle, made up mainly of conscripts. But they do not have the level of artillery and tank support they had on Feb. 24,” Musiyenko said in an interview with Ukrainian television. “They have fewer resources. They are relying on the numerical superiority of their troops.” Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports. Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said. “I will make this point, that Australia stands with the people of Ukraine. That is Australia’s position and Australia is unequivocal in our support for the rule of international law,” Albanese told a news conference after a reporter asked if Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, should be deported after he was seen posing for pictures with fans holding Russian flags. “We do not want to see any support given to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that is having a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine.” Albanese did not respond directly to the question about whether Srdjan Djokovic should be deported. Djokovic’s father could not be reached for comment by Reuters. An adviser to president Zelenskiy has issued a warning to fellow Ukrainian officials which appears to be related to the ongoing drive to stamp out corruption. More than a dozen Ukrainian officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. “Everyone should understand their level of responsibility to the country and nation during the war. Whoever forgets about it receives a quick reaction,” said Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy’s office. “This will happen to everyone who allows themselves to forget (their duties), regardless of names and offices,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. Among the most high-profile cases was that of a deputy defence minister who resigned following a report, which he denied, that his ministry paid inflated prices to feed troops. A presidential adviser who had been called out by local media for driving flashy cars also quit, as did a senior prosecutor who Ukrainian media reported had gone on holiday to Marbella in Spain, flouting martial law. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. But Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, the company operating Russia’s nuclear plants, said the comments were unfounded and called it a “provocation”. Russia has in the past reacted to Ukrainian successes with massed airstrikes that left millions without light, heat or water. On Thursday, it appeared to follow that pattern. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia’s attacks targeted energy plants. “I held an urgent meeting today about the energy situation – about the shortages that are occurring and repair work after the terrorists’ strikes. Repair teams are working in those sites,” Zelenskiy said on Thursday. The Kremlin said it saw the promised delivery of western tanks as evidence of growing “direct involvement” of the United States and Europe in the 11-month-old war, something both deny. In his nightly address following Thursday’s deadly missile strikes across, Zelenskiy called for further sanctions on Russia and for allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Zelenskiy said: This Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies. New sanctions against Russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. And legal weapons - we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for further sanctions on Russia and more weapons for Ukraine, after Russian strikes on Thursday left 11 dead and 11 wounded. We’ll have more from Zelenskiy’s latest address shortly. In the meantime here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych criticised the International Olympic Committee on Thursday for considering allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions. Russia’s finance ministry has proposed scrapping liquidity restrictions for spending on “anti-crisis” investments from its national wealth fund (NWF), citing the need to support key sectors amid challenging geopolitical conditions. The UK hopes the Challenger 2 tanks it is supplying to Ukraine will arrive in the country at the end of March, defence department minister Alex Chalk said on Thursday. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists. The Ukrainian central bank’s foreign currency reserves will stand at about $30bn at the end of January, Yuri Heletiy, the deputy governor told reporters on Thursday, according to Reuters. The arrest of a high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence agent accused of spying for Russia has highlighted the urgent need for a cleanout of the country’s key security service, a former deputy head of the agency has said.",

<p>The weapon is a “kamikaze drone carrying a warhead of about 80 pounds” that can be launched from the back of a flatbed truck, the New York Times <a

operations in the Kharkiv operations, the drone drops out from the sky without any warning.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“It blew the triple-seven in half,” he told the Times, referring to the drone destroying an M777 howitzer supplied by the US to the Ukrainian military. “Instead of firing 100 artillery shells, it’s easier to release one of these drones” to search for a target, he added.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The New York Times also reported Kulagin explaining that the drone is accurate enough to target a self-propelled howitzer in an area close to the turret where gunpowder stored. This in turn creates secondary explosions.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“It’s a very serious problem,” he said, adding that without any countermeasures, the drones “will destroy all

                    "bodyText": "It’s 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. Georgian president Salome Zourabichvili levied heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium earlier this week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. Reuters reports: Some members of a roughly 50-member repair team showed reporters images of damaged U.S.-provided arms, including M777 howitzers, that in the West would have long been considered beyond the scope of repair. Not in Ukraine. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. But Ukrainians are managing to bring these weapons back into battle, thanks to guidance from U.S. forces and manufacturing prowess by Kyiv allowing it to reverse-engineer spare parts. Since the program began in June, more than a dozen teleconference channels have been set up with over 100 Ukrainian contacts. But priority support is being given to the M777s and to the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), which have been central to Ukraine’s counter-offensive nearly seven months since Russian forces invaded. “Combat power for Ukraine is staying at the level it is because of America’s investment in the sustainment,” the soldier said. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The weapon is a “kamikaze drone carrying a warhead of about 80 pounds” that can be launched from the back of a flatbed truck, the New York Times explained. According to Colonel Rodion Kulagin, the commander of artillery operations in the Kharkiv operations, the drone drops out from the sky without any warning. “It blew the triple-seven in half,” he told the Times, referring to the drone destroying an M777 howitzer supplied by the US to the Ukrainian military. “Instead of firing 100 artillery shells, it’s easier to release one of these drones” to search for a target, he added. The New York Times also reported Kulagin explaining that the drone is accurate enough to target a self-propelled howitzer in an area close to the turret where gunpowder stored. This in turn creates secondary explosions. “It’s a very serious problem,” he said, adding that without any countermeasures, the drones “will destroy all our military.” The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. Georgian president Salome Zourabichvili levied heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium earlier this week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. “Those actions “increasingly, clearly include war crimes, include absolutely unacceptable crimes, whether we think of what we found in Bucha or the discovery of mass graves in the reclaimed territories by Ukraine,” he added. “There needs to be a proper investigation and transparency and Vladimir Putin, his supporters and the Russian military need to be held to account for the atrocities they have and are continuing to commit in Ukraine.” The first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, paid her respects to the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall on Sunday, before a reception with the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. The top US general has cautioned that it is still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, calling for vigilance among US troops during a visit to a military base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw following a visit to a base hosting US troops. Reuters was asked not to publish the name of the base or describe its location. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Policy research organisation the Institute for the Study of War has published data suggesting Ukrainian forces are expanding positions east of the Oskil River and north of the Siverskyi Donets River that could allow them to envelop Russian troops holding the city of Lyman. They say: “The Russian defenders in Lyman still appear to consist in large part of Bars (Russian Combat Army Reserve) reservists and the remnants of units badly damaged in the Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, and the Russians do not appear to be directing reinforcements to this area.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, has written an analysis piece for the Guardian on Russia’s underperforming military capability, and why it could lead to its downfall. “Russia’s military was designed to fight short, high-intensity wars. Without full national mobilisation, it is too small, its units lack the logistical enablement and its equipment is ill-suited to a protracted war. When the Russian military issued orders to its troops in the autumn of 2021, it estimated a need for them to be deployed for nine months. They are now reaching that limit. The Ukrainians, by contrast, have been organising their military since 2014 for precisely this kind of war.” Our reporters Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer have spoken to Ukrainian teachers resisting occupation, who say there is “no way” they could work for the Russians. “We have neither a moral nor legal right to demand heroism from people living under occupation. Their main goals should be to save lives and not voluntarily collaborate,” said Ukraine’s education ombudsman. Others want to see all who collaborated punished. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here is everything you might have missed: Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said. The facility was in the process of being evacuated and medical staff were removing patients from the hospital while under heavy fire, Syniehubov said. He added on Telegram: “During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured.” Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen.” Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if they do not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. Prosecutors in an area of Ukraine where Russian forces recently retreated in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive are accusing Russia of torturing civilians in one freed village. Prosecutors in the Kharkiv region said, in an online statement, that they had found a basement where Russian forces allegedly tortured prisoners in the village of Kozacha Lopan, near the border with Russia, Associated Press reports. They released images showing a Russian military TA-57 telephone with additional wires and alligator clips attached to it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of using the Soviet-era radio telephones as a power source to electrocute prisoners during interrogation. Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin. The post called for an end to “the deaths of our boys for illusory aims that make our country a pariah and weigh down the lives of its citizens”. Pugacheva’s message comes a day after Galkin – a comedian who has repeatedly spoken out against the war with Ukraine – was designated a foreign agent by Russia for political activities. Russia’s ministry of justice says that his source of foreign funding is from Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, urged his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Critical Threats and the Institute for the Study of War have created an interactive map that shows the progress Ukrainian military forces have made in taking back Russian-occupied territory. Peter Pomerantsev is an author and senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and writes for us today to argue that Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game: The Ukrainians have (again) done what nobody believed they could. They have (again) defeated the supposedly mighty Russia on the battlefield, shown up the underlying incompetence and moral rot of the Putin system. It took them just six days to take back whole swaths of territory in north-eastern Ukraine that it took Russia six months to conquer. The Russian military, political and propaganda elites are all blaming each other: rifts that usually rumble under the surface are now visible to all. Putin looks shaken. Now it’s time for us to act as well. Not just by increasing help to Ukraine on the battlefield (which is paramount), but also by advancing along the other fronts in this conflict: energy, information, finance and diplomacy. Read more: Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game Our colleague Luke Harding reports from Izium: Standing in the gloom, Maksim Maksimov pointed to the spot where he was tortured with electric shocks. Russian soldiers took him from his cell in the basement of Izium’s police station. They sat him on an office chair and attached a zig-zag crocodile clip to his finger. It was connected by cable to an old-fashioned Soviet military field telephone. And then it began. A soldier cranked the handle, turning it faster and faster. This sent an excruciating pulse through Maksimov’s body. “I collapsed. They pulled me upright. There was a hood on my head. I couldn’t see anything. My legs went numb. I was unable to hear in my left ear,” he recalled. “Then they did it again. I passed out. I came round 40 minutes later back in my cell.” Read more here: Izium: after Russian retreat, horrors of Russian occupation are revealed Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin. The post, reported by Kevin Rothrock, the managing editor of Meduza, also called for an end to “the deaths of our boys for illusory aims that make our country a pariah and weigh down the lives of its citizens.” Pugacheva’s message comes a day after Galkin - a comedian who has repeatedly spoken out against the war with Ukraine - was designated a foreign agent by Russia for political activities.

Our colleague Josh Butler reports: Australia won’t ban Russian tourists from entering the country as requested by Ukraine’s ambassador but is “assessing” whether to reopen the Australian embassy in Kyiv. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, also said on Sunday that Australia was considering sending further military aid to Ukraine to bolster existing commitments. “We do need to be preparing ourselves for protracted conflict and on that basis, we get that we are going to need to provide support for Ukraine over the long term,” Marles told the ABC’s Insiders program.

The BBC’s James Waterhouse has shared a video on Twitter of the final ovation, at the Kyiv Opera House, for ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval. He had performed for 28 seasons before volunteering to fight in the east. Waterhouse points out: “While Ukraine enjoys successes on the battlefield, his death is a reminder of the enduring, awful cost of this war.” Associated Press is reporting that Russian shelling hit cities and towns across a wide stretch of Ukraine during the night. The British Ministry of Defence has warned that Russia is likely to increase its attacks on civilian targets as it suffers battlefield defeats. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. The Russian-installed administration of Kherson said later in the day it had “destroyed” a group of attackers. “There was a clash in the centre of Kherson between sections of the Russian armed forces patrolling the streets of the city and an unidentified group of people,” the administration said on Telegram. On Sunday morning, the Ukrainian southern army command spokeswoman Natalia Gumeniuk said: “Yesterday’s shootings and explosions in Kherson are provocations by the occupiers.” The Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak blamed the shootings on “growing tensions” between different pro-Moscow factions preparing to flee amid news of the Ukrainian army’s advances. Kirill Stremousov, a pro-Moscow official in Kherson, said the city was “calm” on Sunday morning. Kyiv was “trying to attack but without any results”, he said. “We won’t say that everything is smooth and there is no problem in the Kherson region ... [but] everything will be fine.” There have been a series of targeted attacks against pro-Russian officials in Kherson and in other occupied areas in recent weeks. In Diary of an Invasion, the Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov has documented Russia’s attack on his homeland. This morning, the Observer published extracts in which Kurkov recounts the first weeks of the conflict. “You have to get used psychologically to the idea that war has begun. Because from that moment on, war determines your way of life, your way of thinking, your way of making decisions.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, writes for us that Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall: Viewed purely in terms of the size of their formations and equipment, Russian ground forces in Ukraine still pose a serious threat on a number of axes. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely the Russian military can recover from its increasingly terminal trajectory on the battlefield, though its defeat will take time and bitter fighting. To understand why, it is necessary to examine the force beyond its equipment and personnel. The US assesses military capability through the abbreviation DOTMLPF. That senior US officers regularly try to roll this off the tongue as an acronym may exemplify military absurdity, but the abbreviation is somewhat redeemed by being fairly comprehensive. It stands for: doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities. Looking at the Russian military across these categories reveals why it is underperforming its potential and struggling to regenerate. Read more analysis from Jack Watling: Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said. The facility was in the process of being evacuated and medical staff were removing patients from the hospital while under heavy fire, Syniehubov said. He added on Telegram: During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured. The report could not be independently verified. In case you missed it, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes It is 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen.” Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if they do not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. The US president, Joe Biden, urged his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict is likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen. He wanted to take control of the capital, we saw that that was defeated earlier on. We saw that he wanted to weaken Nato. Nato is now much stronger, and we have Finland and Sweden joining. He wants to break the international resolve. Well, actually that strengthened over this period, and he’s under pressure, his problems are mounting. He added: He’s always had a problem in terms of crewing the equipment that he’s got. He hasn’t got sufficient manpower. His forces are thin on the ground. And we’re also seeing a magnificent Ukrainian armed forces who have been courageous, they’re fighting for their country, and they’ve embraced the international support that all of us are providing. A total of 165 ships with 3.7m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry said today. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products are due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. The ministry said in a statement: At 10am, eight ships left the ports of Great Odesa, and two more are waiting for their turn and favourable conditions. Ukraine’s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. Ukraine, a major global grain producer and exporter, shipped up to 6m tonnes of grain a month before the war. Three Black Sea ports were reopened under an agreement signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv and the ministry has said these ports are able to load and send abroad 100-150 cargo ships a month. Reuters reports that Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev will hold security consultations and meetings during a two-day visit to China starting Sunday, China’s foreign ministry said. Patrushev will attend the 17th round of China’s Russia strategic security consultations and the 7th meeting of the China-Russia law enforcement security cooperation during his visit, the foreign ministry said in a statement released on its website on Sunday. The meetings come after Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held face-to-face talks in Uzbekistan on Thursday, their first since the outbreak of the Ukraine war. Our colleague Andrew Roth reports from Belgorod: The war has become impossible to ignore in Belgorod, southern Russia, just miles from the border with Ukraine. Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian counterattack now roam the streets. Air defences boom out overhead several times a day. The city is once again filled with refugees. And, at the border, Russian and Ukrainian soldiers stand within sight of each other. Three Russian soldiers from Ossetia are wandering the unfamiliar streets past the grand Transfiguration Cathedral late one evening. They seem unsteady on their feet, perhaps drunk or tired. And they’re looking for a place to eat. Since February, they say, they have fought in Ukraine as part of the invasion force. They were stationed in the village of Velyki Prokhody, just north of Kharkiv, when the urgent signal came to flee back to Russia last week. Read more: ‘They won’t invade, will they?’ Fears rise in Russian city that Ukraine war could cross border Australia will not ban Russian tourists from entering the country as part of sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine, defence minister Richard Marles said today. Since the start of the conflict, Australia has sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, Reuters reports. It has also supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, while outlawing exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. Asked if Australia would also ban Russian tourists, Marles said sanctions were aimed at Russia’s government, “not the Russian people themselves.” He told ABC television: This is not something we are considering at the moment. Marles refused to be drawn on whether Australia would provide more Bushmasters and other protected vehicles to Ukraine after a recent request from the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia. Australia in July pledged 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113AS4 Armoured Vehicles to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. Russia “would become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been,” Biden said. “Depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.” Russian government officials have dismissed Western suggestions that Moscow would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but it remains a worry for some in the west. And if you want to read more about this issue, our columnist Simon Tisdall has been thinking about it too: Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if it does not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia has launched several thousand long-range missiles against Ukraine since 24 February 2022. However, in the last seven days, Russia has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect. This category of mission has included strikes against the electricity grid, and a dam on the Inhulets River at Kryvyi Rih. As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. The main developments you need to know about are here: US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine.

He doesn’t get that it’s the future, that this is the future of our economy … He’s at the margins.

As well as targeting 100% renewables by 2030, the party would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/labour-will-launch-publicly-owned-energy-firm-keir-starmer-vows\">set up a national publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, </a>and a wealth fund to invest in green technology and green jobs.</p> <p>“It’s at the centre of our agenda, because it’s the future of jobs, the future of the economy, lower bills, energy security and it’s the biggest issue we face as a country and a world,” Miliband said.</p> <p>Voices within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/tories-fighting-net-zero-plans-are-dragging-climate-into-new-culture-war-experts-say\">Tory party have raised doubts over net zero</a>, he noted. “That means you’re saying, we want to carry on with more, dirty, expensive fossil fuels for our energy system, not greener cheaper renewable power,” he said. “That’s not a winning position. Anti-net zero is a very defeatable position.”</p> <p>For “the vast majority of people”, the climate was a “significant issue”, he said. “What they want to know is can this be done in a way that makes economic sense for us, particularly when people are facing a cost of living crisis, and the overwhelming answer is yes,” he said.</p> <p>Labour’s plan for clean power by 2030 would cut bills by £93bn, according to the party’s analysis, through measures including energy efficiency and home insulation programmes, boosting renewable power include more onshore windfarms, and a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas producers.</p> <p>Miliband said pushing for clean energy would also improve people’s health and quality of life. “We’re a country that is racked by terrible fuel poverty, and by the killer of air pollution, and by a deep desire for big economic change,” he said. “As [US president Joe] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/11/cop27-joe-biden-climate-crisis-us\">Biden has shown</a>, being a leader on climate is an answer to all those things.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 November 2022.

He doesn’t get that it’s the future, that this is the future of our economy … He’s at the margins. He sent a message internationally – regrettably – and domestically, with that original decision, which is ‘This isn’t my thing’.” Starmer had shown that Labour would lead on the climate and green jobs, as the central plank of the party’s vision of the future, he added. As well as targeting 100% renewables by 2030, the party would set up a national publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, and a wealth fund to invest in green technology and green jobs. “It’s at the centre of our agenda, because it’s the future of jobs, the future of the economy, lower bills, energy security and it’s the biggest issue we face as a country and a world,” Miliband said. Voices within the Tory party have raised doubts over net zero, he noted. “That means you’re saying, we want to carry on with more, dirty, expensive fossil fuels for our energy system, not greener cheaper renewable power,” he said. “That’s not a winning position. Anti-net zero is a very defeatable position.” For “the vast majority of people”, the climate was a “significant issue”, he said. “What they want to know is can this be done in a way that makes economic sense for us, particularly when people are facing a cost of living crisis, and the overwhelming answer is yes,” he said. Labour’s plan for clean power by 2030 would cut bills by £93bn, according to the party’s analysis, through measures including energy efficiency and home insulation programmes, boosting renewable power include more onshore windfarms, and a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas producers. Miliband said pushing for clean energy would also improve people’s health and quality of life. “We’re a country that is racked by terrible fuel poverty, and by the killer of air pollution, and by a deep desire for big economic change,” he said. “As [US president Joe] Biden has shown, being a leader on climate is an answer to all those things.” • This article was amended on 16 November 2022. An earlier version said that “changes to the planning system under David Cameron have in effect prevented any new onshore windfarms being built in the UK since 2015”. That should have referred to England.",

The cable does not name specific Russian targets but says the US is providing classified information to select individual countries.</p> \n  <p>It is the latest effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence about Moscow’s military and political aims, dating back to ultimately correct assessments that Russia would launch a new war against Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>Many of Joe Biden’s top national security officials have extensive experience countering Moscow and served in government when Vladimir Putin launched wide-ranging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/17/russian-propagandists-targeted-african-americans-2016-election\">campaigns to influence the 2016</a> and 2020 US presidential elections.</p> \n  <p>A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his top deputies have long accused Putin of meddling in domestic politics. The official noted allegations of Russian influence in recent elections in Albania, Bosnia and Montenegro.</p> \n  <p>Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia’s covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges. That includes thinktanks in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and state-owned enterprises in Central America, Asia, the Middle East and north Africa.</p> \n  <p>The US has historically also covertly funded political groups and been responsible for efforts to topple or undermine foreign governments.

At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. Russia covertly spent more than $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and other officials in more than two dozen countries, according to declassified cables released by the US. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. – Vivian Ho, Guardian staff From the AP: Russia has covertly spent more than $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and other officials in more than two dozen countries, according to a newly declassified state department cable. The cable, signed by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and released on Tuesday, cites a new intelligence assessment of Russia’s global covert efforts to support policies and parties sympathetic to Moscow. The cable does not name specific Russian targets but says the US is providing classified information to select individual countries. It is the latest effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence about Moscow’s military and political aims, dating back to ultimately correct assessments that Russia would launch a new war against Ukraine. Many of Joe Biden’s top national security officials have extensive experience countering Moscow and served in government when Vladimir Putin launched wide-ranging campaigns to influence the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his top deputies have long accused Putin of meddling in domestic politics. The official noted allegations of Russian influence in recent elections in Albania, Bosnia and Montenegro. Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia’s covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges. That includes thinktanks in Europe and state-owned enterprises in Central America, Asia, the Middle East and north Africa. The US has historically also covertly funded political groups and been responsible for efforts to topple or undermine foreign governments. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, rejected comparisons between Russia’s activities and current US financing of media and political initiatives. Russians left a ghost town behind in Bohorodychne. The AFP has this heartbreaking dispatch from the village, where just two people remained: Nina Gonchar and her son Mykola, standing in front of their shattered house, appear to be the last two residents still left in the village. Some of their family members were murdered, they told AFP. “The Russians came, they killed my brother and my sister-in-law,” says 58-year-old Mykola. Russian soldiers wanted to use his brother’s home as a base, but after he refused, they gunned the house down, killing the couple at the same time. Mykola says he wrapped the bodies in blankets and buried them himself. He and his frail 92-year-old mother “barely survived” the occupation thanks to food jars, a few poultry and some vegetables in the garden. “How can I describe it with words? It was difficult, I was afraid,” Mykola says. His mother, traumatised by the fighting, still goes back into hiding in the shelter her son dug in their garden, even though the area is back in the hands of Ukraine again. “I cry every day. They killed my son,” Nina says, wiping tears from her eyes with a veil. Luke Harding in Lviv and Dan Sabbagh report: Ukraine consolidated its control of the Kharkiv region on Tuesday, raising flags on towns and villages occupied by Russian troops for six months, and reclaiming areas seized by Moscow on the first day of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The state border service in Kyiv said it had liberated the city of Vovchansk, a couple of kilometres from the international border. Russian soldiers left on Sunday, it added, after the stunning Ukrainian counter-offensive. In the space of a few days Ukraine has pushed the Russians out from more than 6,000 sq km of territory, including zones in the south of the country where a separate counter-offensive is ongoing to recapture the city of Kherson. Russian units have fled in disarray. Serhiy Hadai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said local partisans had raised the Ukrainian flag over the key town of Kreminna, which was “completely empty”. Its Russian occupiers had either left the area or were too scared to take it down, he suggested. Russian battalions have fallen back to new positions east of the Oskil River, about 10 miles from the freshly liberated city of Izium. The city was almost entirely destroyed and more than 1,000 residents killed during five months of occupation and in recent fighting, Kyiv says. Video confirmed the scale of the damage. It showed pulverised high-rise apartment blocs, trashed schools, blown up bridges, and burnt-out Russian military vehicles marked with the letter Z. The Kremlin used Izium as a garrison and arms depot in its operation to seize the Donbas. Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. The BBC has reported some graphic accounts of torture from local residents: Artem, who lives in the city of Balakliya in the Kharkiv province told the BBC he was held by Russians for more than 40 days, and was tortured with electrocution. The epicentre of the brutality was the city’s police station, which Russian forces used as their headquarters. Artem said he could hear screams of pain and terror coming from other cells. The occupiers made sure the cries could be heard, he said, by turning off the building’s noisy ventilation system. “They turned it off so everyone could hear how people scream when they are shocked with electricity,” he told us. “They did this to some of the prisoners every other day... They even did this to the women”. And they did it to Artem, though in his case only once. “They made me hold two wires,” he said. “There was an electric generator. The faster it went, the higher the voltage. They said, ‘if you let it go, you are finished’. Then they started asking questions. They said I was lying, and they started spinning it even more and the voltage increased.” Artem told us he was detained because the Russians found a picture of his brother, a soldier, in uniform. Another man from Balakliya was held for 25 days because he had the Ukrainian flag, Artem said. A school principal called Tatiana told us she was held in the police station for three days and also heard screams from other cells. We visited the police station, and saw the Lord’s Prayer scratched on the wall of one of the cramped cells, alongside markings to indicate how many days had passed. Ukrainian police officers say as many as eight men were held in cells intended for two people. They say locals were scared to even pass the station when the Russians were in charge, in case they were grabbed by Russian soldiers. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo in Balakliia report: The roads leading to Balakliia, a former frontline town in Kharkiv province recently recaptured by Ukraine, were littered with the detritus of war; carcasses of Russian tanks, crates of abandoned ammunition and destroyed vehicles were scattered along the sides. Three of the bridges into the town had been blown up. One had been replaced with a pontoon bridge, but that too was out of action after a truck turned on its side while crossing. Several houses on the outskirts were destroyed, as well as factories and farms Russian and Ukrainian forceshad used as bases. Locals said they heard explosions every day from late February onwards and spent most of the last seven months at home and in their basements. Around the beginning of last week, they said, they heard an increase in shelling and shortly after, the Russian forces just fled, some even on foot. Those on Balakliia’s streets on Tuesday, just a small part of the 6,000 square km Volodomyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine has recaptured during its counteroffensive, were mostly older middle-aged or elderly, wheeling bicycles. They said younger people who had children had mainly left for Europe. What the people of Balakliia experienced appears to have differed to the residents of towns in Kyiv region and other northern parts of Ukraine that came under Russian occupation at the beginning of the invasion, suffering well-documented atrocities in commuter towns such as Bucha. The first lady of Ukraine will be a guest of honor at the EU State of the Union on Wednesday, Reuters reports: Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska will be the guest of honor at Wednesday’s EU State of the Union, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday on Twitter. “The courage of Ukrainian people has touched and inspired the world. Europe will stand with you every step of the way,” she said. Von der Leyen is expected to unveil a package of measures to pull down soaring energy prices in the EU during her speech on Wednesday. Ukraine president Volodomyr Zelenskiy announced today that the country is in full control of more than 4,000 square km (1,500 square miles) of territory that was once held by Russia. Zelenskiy also said during an address on Tuesday that an additional 4,000 sq km was being stabilized, reported Reuters. Yesterday, he said Ukraine had retaken 6,000 sq km during its recent counter-offensive against Russia, but other Ukrainian officials have said that it is impossible to distinguish between recapturing a territory and ensuring it is totally safe. Two main power lines that power the city of Kharkiv were also restored, reports Reuters: Ukrainian repair crews have restored the two main power lines supplying the eastern city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region, power firm Ukrenergo said on Tuesday after Russian shelling caused blackouts. In a statement, Ukrenergo said repair work on other lines would continue, but gave no details. The director general of the UN nuclear watchdog announced that all three of the backup power lines are back up at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. The power lines had gone down on Saturday, but have all since been restored. “One of them, a 750/330 kilovolt (kV) line, is now providing the ZNPP with the external electricity it needs for cooling and other essential safety functions. The 330 kV and the 150 kV lines are being held in reserve,” said the IAEA in a statement today. The International Atomic Energy Agency also announced that power had been restored to residents in Enerhodar, which suffered a complete blackout last week. The White House said today that it will likely announce an additional military aid package in the “coming days”, reported Reuters. “I do think you’ll see another one here in coming days,” said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby to reporters. So far, the US has given $15.2bn to Ukraine, announced the state department last week. There has been no additional information on how much more will be given in the most recent aid package. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. A western official said it was “too early to say” if Ukraine’s success in regaining 6,000 sq km of territory in the Kharkiv region represented “a turning point” in the more than six-month-long war, playing down the significance of Kyiv’s recapture of Izium and Kupiansk. Nevertheless it was, the official acknowledged, “a moment that has power” and they confirmed that the amount of territory gained by Ukraine in the past week amounted to “half the size of Wales”. The official was speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukraine had succeeded in surprising Russia with its attack on the lightly defended Kharkiv region, partly by first attacking in the Kherson territory in the south of the country, diverting Moscow’s forces and attention. “In marked contrast to Russia, Ukraine has demonstrated impressive operational art and an adherence to the core principles of war. From late July, it (Ukraine) has presented multiple threats which led to Russia repositioning forces thereby creating areas of weakness. Ukraine then concentrated forces against that weakness,” the official said. The military development was “in strict military terms a withdrawal ordered and sanctioned by (Russia’s) general staff, the official added, but the professionalism displayed by retreating units varied considerably from orderly withdrawal to “apparent panic” abandoning “a significant quantity of operational vehicles, weapons and ammunition”. Russia was attempting to create a new frontline in the Oskil river, and the result of last week’s battle was painted partly as an attempt by Moscow to rationalise its long frontlines to protect its territory in the Donbas and the land bridge to Crimea. But there was praise for Ukraine’s “innovative and experimental” military strategy as compared to Russia, whose commanders were at times referring decisions to the Kremlin. “Moscow is operating with a long screwdriver,” the official added. Beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces, terrorised teenagers too scared to leave their basement: this is just some of what Russian forces left behind when Ukrainian troops recaptured large swathes of the Kharkiv region, according to Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament. At least 150,000 Ukrainians were living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Information is trickling out now from the towns and villages that Ukrainian forces have recaptured – many of these areas have been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Residents in these areas are now describing the horror of what life was like during those long months. One woman told a reporter: “It was just cruel when the Russians came. Neighbours betrayed each other. Many probably thought that the Russian soldiers would stay forever.” “Now it’s like seven months ago, only the other way around: neighbours tell each other who was particularly friendly to the Russians,” she said. “I just want peace again.” Russian forces have continued looting as Ukrainian troops push them further east, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in today’s daily briefing. Officials said that on a section of the highway running north and south between Starobilsk and Luhansk, they spotted about 300 civilian vehicles, mostly with the state license plates of the Kharkiv region, heading in the direction of Luhansk. Most of these vehicles had “trailers loaded with looted property” and were being driven by Russian military. In Polohy, a city in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south of the country, “Russian occupants break the gates of private garages, take private cars from locals,” the general staff said. Meanwhile in the Kherson region, the general staff said similar behaviour was noted in the removal of “furniture and household appliances from temporarily abandoned homes”. Russian forces hit a number of civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Using air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. “More than 25 settlements suffered artillery shelling,” the general staff said in its daily briefing. “In addition, the enemy intensified air reconnaissance.” Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 square kilometres (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. Balakliya was one of the more than 20 towns and villages recaptured by the Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv oblast over the past few days. Here is a look at some of the devastation left behind after the Russian troops withdrew: Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs is estimating that at least 53,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the Russian forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. Blinken has called for “an end to any military hostilities immediately” after fighting broke out near the two countries’ border in the worst escalation of hostilities since the 2020 war. “Whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot, to create a distraction from Ukraine, is something we’re always concerned about,” Blinken told Reuters at an event in Indiana. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. Izium was one of the cities in the Kharkiv oblast that had been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. After Ukrainian troops recaptured much of the region in a dramatic counteroffensive, the outside world is getting a clear look at what happened to these cities while they were under Russian control. As Ukraine calls for more weapons, pressure mounts on Germany to fulfil its commitment: To recap: When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shocked the world by announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons. He committed Germany to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” Russian forces shelled Lozova, a city in the Kharkiv oblast, early this morning after letting up on their barrage of the region following two days of targeted attacks on its infrastructure that knocked out the power and water supply. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv oblast, said on Telegram that authorities were still confirming the number of casualties from this morning’s strike. In yesterday’s shelling, one person was killed and six injured in Kharkiv city, according to the Centre for Emergency Medical Assistance. One person was injured in the Izium district. Two people were wounded in the Kharkiv district – one by a landmine in the village of Ruski Tyshky. Two civilians were killed in the Kupiansk district. Synehubov warned that even in recaptured territories landmine danger remains high and that civilians should remain vigilant. An ammonia gas deal that the United Nations is pushing Russia and Ukraine to agree could ultimately stabilise a landmark grain deal, a western diplomat briefed on the matter told Reuters. Under the proposed ammonia deal, ammonia gas owned by Russian fertiliser producer Uralchem would be brought via pipeline to the Russia-Ukraine border. There it would be purchased by US-headquartered commodities trader Trammo, the diplomat said. Trammo would then own the ammonia as it travels across Ukraine, paying Ukraine pumping fees and transit fees, and sell it onto world markets from Ukraine’s Black Sea, according to the proposal. “The actual financial flows are not insignificant,” the diplomat told Reuters. “By having a key Russian company export through the same Black Sea corridors that the Ukrainian grain is going through stabilises the arrangement and could lead to a longer term extension of the agreement,” the diplomat said. Earlier today, Turkey’s ministry of defence said seven more ships had left Ukraine under the Turkey-UN-Russia-Ukraine deal to facilitate grain exports. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine on the newswires. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has just posted a response on his Telegram channel to the publication of that report co-authored by former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. Ukraine’s president posted: The first yet crucially important step towards future security guarantees for Ukraine has been taken. During our meeting, Andrey Yermak and former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen presented the elaborated recommendations, which should become the basis of the Kyiv Security Compact. I am thankful to the Yermak-Rasmussen International Working Group for drafting this package of proposals. It is necessary that the Group continues its work and completes the project. Ukraine’s allies should commit to legally binding large-scale weapons transfers and multi-decade investment in the country’s defences, according to a report that looked at alternatives to Kyiv’s long-term aspirations to join the Nato alliance. The report was commissioned by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and co-authored by the former Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. The purpose of the report was to provide a security structure for Ukraine that guarantees Russia does not seek to invade again, and is separate from calls by Zelenskiy for the west to step up arms supplies to drive home the sudden advance by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine’s possible future membership in Nato was one of the issues that Russia claimed as justification for its February invasion. The report, the subject of wide diplomatic consultations, does not propose that Nato countries collectively should be required to offer their troops in defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but says there should be no restriction on the military diplomatic and economic help provided by Nato member countries through bilateral agreements. The level of support could be scalable according to the level of threat and should apply to all of Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The report argues the “strongest security guarantee for Ukraine lies in its capacity to defend itself against an aggressor … To do so, Ukraine needs the resources to maintain a significant defensive force capable of withstanding the Russian Federation’s armed forces and paramilitaries.” Read more of the report from diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Long-term military investment proposed as alternative to Ukraine joining Nato In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The call for more air defence comes as Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, criticised Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, surprised the world with his historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. Tomorrow, Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine, and “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine” will definitely be discussed. One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the line between legally criticising Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine and falling foul of wartime censorship laws that carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison “is very, very thin”. Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine tomorrow, hot on the heels of Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rebuking Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. “The success of the Ukrainian defence forces in conducting a counteroffensive operation unites European political forces. Especially in Germany,” the main directorate intelligence of Ukraine’s ministry of defence said in a statement. The statement said “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine will be raised” during Berbock’s visit. “After all, this will help to continue the successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian defence forces and liberate the territories captured by the Russian Federation.” Earlier, Kuleba had harsh words for Germany and chancellor Olaf Scholz, who surprised the world and Germany’s allies when he announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. That was early in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Defence intelligence officials noted that Russian nationals were “secretly trying to sell their homes and to urgently evacuate their relatives from the peninsula”. In recently recaptured areas of the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian authorities are finding bodies of civilians displaying signs of torture, an echo of the war crimes uncovered after Ukrainian troops retook Bucha and other areas around Kyiv. Although the Ukrainian prosecutor general is still investigating, the implication is that Russian soldiers have once again committed war crimes – torturing and killing civilians – while the region was under Russian occupation. The Kremlin countered today by accusing the Ukrainian army of abusing civilians in the territories it had recaptured, The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Kyiv’s army of abusing civilians in territory it had recaptured, Agence France-Presse is reporting. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for the Kremlin, said that report have emerged out of Kharkiv of “outrageous” treatment of civilians. “There are a lot of punitive measures … people are being tortured, people are being mistreated and so on,” Peskov told journalists. The Russian military said on Tuesday that it responded to Kyiv’s dramatic counter-offensive with “massive strikes” on all frontlines in Ukraine, but it appears that at least some of whatever recent shelling took place was directed at civilian targets. “Air, rocket and artillery forces are carrying out massive strikes on units of the Ukrainian armed forces in all operational directions,” the Russian defence ministry said in its daily briefing on the conflict, according to Agence France-Presse. The defence ministry said in a statement it had launched “high-precision” strikes on Ukrainian positions around Slovyansk and Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region. In an attempt to convince even more Russian soldiers to give up, Ukrainian forces are launching shells filled with flyers ahead of their advance, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. “Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t mean anything for them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the flyers read. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, had strong words for Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now — to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat: Yesterday, deputies from 18 Moscow and St Petersburg regions put forth issued a statement saying that Putin should resign because they believed his actions “harm the future of Russia and its citizens”. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes,” Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg, told the Insider. “Our function is to represent the interests of the people, and we see that the people are not satisfied.” Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. This comes after two days of Russian shelling knocked out power to much of Kharkiv. Any kind of attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, could have catastrophic results for the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 sq miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Hanna Malyar said: “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region. Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly.” The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later today. Vivian Ho will be here shortly to guide you through the next few hours. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that shows soldiers ripping down Russian signs and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region close to the border with Russia. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has posted on social media to say that he has spoken to Italian prime minister Mario Draghi. Ukraine’s president said: Had a conversation with Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Informed him about the developments at the front. Noted the importance of defence cooperation with Italy. We should enhance it. Discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The guarantee of its security is demilitarisation and return under Ukrainian control. Here is a video clip from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address last night when he declared that Ukraine has recaptured 2,300 sq miles (6,000 sq km) of territory. He urged allies to provide equipment to enhance his country’s ability to defend itself. Reuters is now carrying some additional quotes from its interview with Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. It quotes her saying: Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly. Speaking on the road to Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub recaptured by Ukrainian forces late last week, she said Ukraine had taken the decision to press on with its operation in the Kharkiv region due to the successes notched up so far. Fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region but Ukraine’s forces are making good progress because its forces are highly motivated and its operation is well planned, deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar told Reuters on Tuesday. “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region,” Malyar said in an interview. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update to Telegram on the situation on the ground in Donetsk. He claims that: The Russians have completely left Kreminna, but the armed forces have not yet entered the city. We are monitoring the situation in Lyman – the liberation of which is key for our region, fighting is still going on around the city. The large-scale de-occupation of Luhansk Oblast will begin from Kreminna and Svatove, the Russians have already begun to pull equipment closer to these cities. The main impact will be there. Today, Kreminna is completely empty – the Russian army has left the city. The Ukrainian flag raised by the partisans flies there. The situation in Starobilsk is somewhat similar. But in Svatove, the Rashists fled at first, but returned after some time. There is a shortage of fuel in the occupied territories due to the large-scale escape of the occupiers and collaborators. The claims have not been independently verified. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday, according to reports from Reuters. Germany’s gas storage levels are higher than this time last year and will continue to be filled before winter, Scholz will say according to a copy of his speech for delivery at the German Employers’ Day. If you need a reminder, here is a map showing how rapidly the Ukrainian counteroffensive has been able to push back the Russian line of control in Kharkiv in the north-east of Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that Kharkiv is again without electricity following Russian strikes on 11 September. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. The FSB said a man was suspected of taking photographs of equipment from Russia’s fighter planes and sending them to a Ukrainian citizen who worked at a Ukrainian aviation plant, according to the reports. Reuters reports the FSB said it had opened a treason case against the suspect. Pavlo Kyrylenko, who is Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has given a morning update on Telegram. He states that: In Slovyansk, at least one person was killed and one person was injured by shelling. The town of Hostre in the Kurakhivska community came under fire — fortunately, no one was injured. Avdiivka has been subjected to massive shelling at dawn for several days in a row. Today there were no casualties, we are clarifying the extent of the damage. Three people were injured as a result of the night shelling of Toretsk, and at least four houses were damaged. He also reported that several buildings were damaged during the attacks. The claims have not been independently verified. We reported earlier that there have been clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has been going on for decades. [See 5.36am] It appears the latest flare-up ended swiftly. Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan had called on Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron and US secretary of state Antony Blinken to discuss the situation, but Reuters has a snap saying that there are local media reports that a ceasefire has been agreed. Azerbaijan borders Russia to the south. This is Martin Belam on the live blog now for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com With Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, set to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan this week, a senior Chinese diplomat has said Beijing was willing to shape the international order together with Russia in a “more just and rational direction”. Agence France-Presse reports: China and Russia have drawn closer in recent years as part of what they call a “no limits” relationship acting as a counterweight to the global dominance of the United States. On Monday, the Communist party’s foreign affairs chief, Yang Jiechi, told Russia’s ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov, that China was “willing to work with Russia to continuously implement the spirit of high-level strategic cooperation between the two countries, safeguard the common interests of both sides, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction”. Russia has sought to bolster ties with Asian countries, particularly China, since being hit with unprecedented western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Heightening tensions between China and the west, Beijing has not condemned Moscow’s interventions in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson is now unusable by Russian military, the Kyiv Independent reports. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukraine’s forces destroyed one tank, five 152 mm gun-howitzers, including one Msta-B and one Msta-S howitzer, and 12 units of armoured vehicles, among other Russian military equipment. As a result, 59 Russian troops were killed, the command said. A group of Ukrainian civil society leaders says sweeping electricity cuts are part of Russia’s strategy, urging the US to ramp up support to maximise recent gains before winter, Agence France-Presse reports. Much of eastern Ukraine was plunged into a blackout on Sunday, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, blaming deliberate attacks by Moscow as Kyiv made startling gains on the battlefield. “Their approach is to have more cold before the winter season starts by destroying all critical infrastructure,” said Hanna Hopko, who heads the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, an umbrella group of civil society organizations. Hopko, addressing reporters at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said: “Putin really thinks that neither Ukraine nor Europe will survive this winter. That’s what he really hopes and that is actually the central pillar around which he now is developing his threats.” US leaders are being careful not to declare a premature victory after a Ukrainian offensive forced Russian troops into a messy retreat in the north, the Associated Press reports. Although there was widespread celebration of Ukraine’s gains over the weekend, US officials know Russian President Vladimir Putin still has troops and resources to tap, and his forces still control large swaths of the east and south. “I agree there should be no spiking of the ball because Russia still has cards it can play,” said Philip Breedlove, a retired US air force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016. “Ukraine is now clearly making durable changes in its east and north and I believe that if the west properly equips Ukraine, they’ll be able to hold on to their gains.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russia could take years to rebuild one of its most prestigious tank units after the retreat from Kharkiv oblast. In its latest intelligence briefing on Twitter, the MoD said the 1st Guards Tank Army had been severely degraded, leaving Russia’s conventional forces “severely weakened”. As Russia’s forces retreat from the Kharkiv region, they are leaving behind hundreds of military vehicles, including tanks and trucks. Our picture editors assembled this series of striking images of abandoned equipment. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will speak with International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters, as Ukraine continues to press the global lender for a full-fledged financing program. Ukrainian officials have said they are seeking an IMF program worth as much as $15bn to $20bn, although such a large amount is seen as unlikey to win IMF approval. The IMF Executive Board, at an informal session on Monday, discussed a plan that could offer Ukraine $1.4bn in emergency aid. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan, which re-established full control over the territory in a six-week conflict in 2020, acknowledged casualties among its forces. Armenia made no mention of losses, but said clashes persisted overnight. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council, Interfax reported. You can read the full story here: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, says Ukrainian forces have made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. “It’s too early to tell exactly where this is going. The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine as well as equipment and arms and munitions. They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure as we’ve seen.” Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It’s now 7.30am in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 square miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Defense Ministry. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. The US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg.",

A total of 185,000 of its upmarket A-Class, B-Class and all-electric EQA cars were assembled here last year in the factory, close to the French border. They are then taken by road, rail and ship to their new owners, perhaps to zip through European capitals, Chinese cities, or along California’s coastal roads. Mercedes-Benz Group (MBG) produces hundreds of thousands such vehicles a year from eight German factories: Rastatt is one of three in the state of Baden-Württemberg, near the company’s physical and spiritual home in Stuttgart. The carmaker lends its name to a whole area of this affluent city – the Benzviertel, where its headquarters and museum are located – and to its Bundesliga football club’s stadium. But Mercedes and the country’s wider economy now stand at a crossroads. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a race to find new energy supplies amid sanctions and Russia’s throttling of gas pipelines – a crisis that has already forced Germany to extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants. The failure of diplomatic policy towards Moscow has also prompted much soul-searching in Germany over its choice of business partners, with questions now being raised over the wisdom of its reliance on China. As winter closes in and demand for energy increases, Mercedes and its rivals have had to adapt to ensure they can keep production facilities such as Rastatt running. Somewhat fortuitously, Mercedes says its decision last year to make its production carbon-neutral from this year left it well placed to respond. “We had a big advantage, because we finalised a large green energy contract for all of our factories last year,” says Jörg Burzer, the MBG board member responsible for production and supply chains. “This is a contract which focuses on wind, solar and hydroelectric power.” Germany’s businesses and households had grown accustomed to plentiful Russian gas and oil for many years.

His predecessor, Angela Merkel, has come under fire for Germany’s diplomatic failures, but refuses to criticise the decision to facilitate even greater Russian gas supplies through the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, halted by Scholz just before the Kremlin’s troops poured into Ukraine. There has also been outcry over the role of former Social Democrat party (SDP) chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who led the country from 1998 to 2005 before monetising his friendship with Putin through lucrative roles on the boards of Nord Stream 2 and Russian state oil company Rosneft. Now another of the pillars of its economy is up for reassessment: its relationship with China. Germany is in the middle of a “structural shift” following the shocks of the war, the energy crisis and pandemic disruption to global trade, according to analysts, even if the business community has only belatedly started to adapt.

The three-way agreement between the members of the country’s ruling coalition – Scholz’s SPD, the Greens and the Free Democrats – has labelled the relationship with China a “systematic rivalry”. It also refers to human rights issues and Taiwan, as well as the need for economic diversification. Last month, accompanied by a high-powered economic delegation, Scholz was the first western leader to be granted a state visit to China since the outbreak of Covid and Xi Jinping’s moves to strengthen his power. Back home, Scholz has come in for criticism – including from coalition partners – for pushing through a deal allowing Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to buy a near-25% stake in three terminals at Germany’s largest port, Hamburg, the city where he was once mayor. “Germany needs to reinvent itself,” says Noah Barkin, an expert in Europe-China relations at US analysts Rhodium Group. “There is a realisation that Germany is too dependent on China, that its biggest companies are too reliant on the Chinese market.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was real. “Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn’t mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn’t exist,” he told reporters. </p> \n<p>Shoigu discussed the “rapidly deteriorating situation” in phone calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts and also spoke by phone with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he “rejected any pretext for Russian escalation”.</p> \n<p>Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a “dirty bomb” – conventional explosives laced with radioactive material.</p> \n<p>Analysts have noted that a “dirty bomb” would have little utility for Ukraine on the battlefield, not least when its forces are currently retaking large swathes of territory by conventional means, instead interpreting Russia’s claim as a pretext for its own planned escalation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/10/ukraine241022-zip/giv-6562k7886YhjH8VR/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/10/ukraine241022-zip/giv-6562k7886YhjH8VR/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In an overnight address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian accusation was a sign that Moscow was planning such an attack itself and would blame Ukraine.</p> \n<p>“If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said. “So when today the Russian minister of defence organises a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called ‘dirty’ nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"58e20329-5acf-44cb-81ff-9e254086eb59\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/40PRSwSgvUI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Shoigu’s comments fit a worrying pattern of escalatory actions by Moscow as the tide of the war has turned against it, most recently with its targeting of civilian infrastructure with missiles and “kamikaze” drones after Kyiv’s attack on the Kerch strait bridge in Crimea earlier this month.</p> \n<p>In a joint statement after the talks, Britain, France and the US said they were committed to supporting Ukraine “for as long as it takes” and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb\"> rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”</a>.</p> \n<p>“Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,” they said. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.”</p> \n<p>Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia and the International Institute for Strategic Affairs, commented on Twitter: “It’s Russia that is escalating: attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, apparent attacks on western connectivity infrastructure, and mining of Novaya Kakhovka dam. And playing with nuclear fire in Zaporizhzhiya [nuclear power plant] for months.</p> \n<p>“So [it’s] hard to see these calls as anything other than Shoigu either doubling down on Putin’s bluffs, or preparing way for Russian nuclear use. Yes, nuclear (ie fission [rather than a dirty bomb]). A dirty bomb would breach nuclear taboo but not achieve significant effects.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I worry there is too much motivated reasoning in dismissing possible Russian nuclear use. We don’t want it to happen, and/or we don’t see the point, therefore it won’t. But Russia faces logic of dwindling choices as it loses. Escalation of all kinds more likely.”</p> \n<p>The latest threats from Moscow come as Russian forces appear to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River near Kherson, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians, and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself.</p> \n<p>About 25,000 people have been transported from the area since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. However, Russia-installed authorities in Kherson reported insufficient vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a “sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave”.</p> \n<p>The Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said in a video message: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives. It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.”</p> \n<p>Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military spy chief, warned that the reported transportation of civilians from Kherson was part of a Russian information campaign. While Russia is moving financial structures, equipment, vulnerable residents and wounded people from Kherson, he said, it is also reinforcing defences.</p> \n<p>“They are creating the illusion that all is lost. Yet at the same time they are moving new military units in and preparing to defend the streets of Kherson,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda online media outlet.</p> \n<p>On Monday, the region’s Russian-installed administration announced the formation of a local militia, saying that all men remaining in the city could join.</p> \n<p>Russia accused western countries of having “essentially stolen” its gold and foreign exchange reserves via sanctions.</p> \n<p>Asked by reporters about an EU proposal to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Peskov said: “In general, a part large of our assets have been essentially stolen by specific western countries.”</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. With Russian troops setting up new defences for a fresh Ukrainian offensive in Luhansk in the country’s east as well, Moscow appears to be preparing the ground for yet further escalation, with discredited claims that Kyiv may be preparing to use a dirty bomb as a “false-flag operation” to blame Russia. Refuting the Russian allegation, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview on Monday: “The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd.” Russian officials – including Vladimir Putin – have repeatedly hinted that the Kremlin may be prepared to use a nuclear weapon as part of its so-far failed brinkmanship to discourage Kyiv and its western allies, which have been supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, intelligence and training. However, the Kremlin continued to push the claim of a Ukrainian dirty bomb on Monday, with Igor Kirilov, head of the Armed Forces radioactive weapons unit, saying that troops had been mobilised to work in a radioactively contaminated environment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was real. “Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn’t mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn’t exist,” he told reporters. Shoigu discussed the “rapidly deteriorating situation” in phone calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts and also spoke by phone with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he “rejected any pretext for Russian escalation”. Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a “dirty bomb” – conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Analysts have noted that a “dirty bomb” would have little utility for Ukraine on the battlefield, not least when its forces are currently retaking large swathes of territory by conventional means, instead interpreting Russia’s claim as a pretext for its own planned escalation. In an overnight address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian accusation was a sign that Moscow was planning such an attack itself and would blame Ukraine. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said. “So when today the Russian minister of defence organises a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called ‘dirty’ nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war.” Shoigu’s comments fit a worrying pattern of escalatory actions by Moscow as the tide of the war has turned against it, most recently with its targeting of civilian infrastructure with missiles and “kamikaze” drones after Kyiv’s attack on the Kerch strait bridge in Crimea earlier this month. In a joint statement after the talks, Britain, France and the US said they were committed to supporting Ukraine “for as long as it takes” and rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”. “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,” they said. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.” Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia and the International Institute for Strategic Affairs, commented on Twitter: “It’s Russia that is escalating: attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, apparent attacks on western connectivity infrastructure, and mining of Novaya Kakhovka dam. And playing with nuclear fire in Zaporizhzhiya [nuclear power plant] for months. “So [it’s] hard to see these calls as anything other than Shoigu either doubling down on Putin’s bluffs, or preparing way for Russian nuclear use. Yes, nuclear (ie fission [rather than a dirty bomb]). A dirty bomb would breach nuclear taboo but not achieve significant effects.” He added: “I worry there is too much motivated reasoning in dismissing possible Russian nuclear use. We don’t want it to happen, and/or we don’t see the point, therefore it won’t. But Russia faces logic of dwindling choices as it loses. Escalation of all kinds more likely.” The latest threats from Moscow come as Russian forces appear to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River near Kherson, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians, and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself. About 25,000 people have been transported from the area since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. However, Russia-installed authorities in Kherson reported insufficient vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a “sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave”. The Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said in a video message: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives. It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.” Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military spy chief, warned that the reported transportation of civilians from Kherson was part of a Russian information campaign. While Russia is moving financial structures, equipment, vulnerable residents and wounded people from Kherson, he said, it is also reinforcing defences. “They are creating the illusion that all is lost. Yet at the same time they are moving new military units in and preparing to defend the streets of Kherson,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda online media outlet. On Monday, the region’s Russian-installed administration announced the formation of a local militia, saying that all men remaining in the city could join. Russia accused western countries of having “essentially stolen” its gold and foreign exchange reserves via sanctions. Asked by reporters about an EU proposal to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Peskov said: “In general, a part large of our assets have been essentially stolen by specific western countries.”",

                    "bodyText": "Leading green Conservatives have backed Boris Johnson’s call for his successor to invest in renewable energy, amid concern that the Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss could rely more on fossil fuels to combat soaring prices. In one of his final speeches as prime minister, Johnson is set to warn against focusing on short-term solutions and neglecting both renewables and a wider shift towards net zero. While officials say details of the speech are still to be worked out, they say Johnson will stress that growth in sources such as wind power, as well as new nuclear power stations, would protect the UK from future energy crises. Truss and her rival in the Conservative leadership race, Rishi Sunak, have both called for more nuclear energy. However, they have been notably sceptical at times in their comments and planned policies on renewable sources. Sunak has pledged to make it even harder to get permission for onshore windfarms, while Truss spoke out vehemently against solar panels being installed on agricultural land. The foreign secretary will reportedly issue dozens of oil and gas drilling licences if she is elected prime minister next week. She will invite applications for licences to explore new fields and up to 130 are set to be issued, sources told the Times. The most recent figures from Offshore Energies UK estimate that there are 15bn barrels of oil and gas still under the North Sea. Truss has faced criticism for delaying her announcement on addressing soaring energy prices until after the leadership election concludes on Monday. Chris Skidmore, a Conservative former minister who set up the Net Zero Support Group within the parliamentary party and has become a leading Tory voice on green issues, said he was keen for Truss and Sunak to understand the need to invest in renewables. “The reason why I wanted to ensure every candidate in the leadership contest committed to net zero was not just to ensure that the UK maintained its international leadership on climate change – it was precisely because net zero isn’t just about reducing emissions but determining our future energy security and economic growth,” the MP for Kingswood told the Guardian. “The private sector and international markets already understand that investing in the energy transition is the way forward for future growth. “Net zero is now our way out of this cost of gas crisis. We have reached a tipping point where renewables are now far cheaper than fossil fuels and I genuinely believe that 2022 will be viewed by historians as the year that we recognised from this crisis that the world woke up to the need to deliver energy sovereignty through renewable and clean power.” Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, which has the support of 133 Tory MPs, half the parliamentary party backbench, said a commitment to net zero was “essential if we’re to tackle our dependency on dubious regimes for energy”. He said: “Boris Johnson is right that delivering net zero goes hand-in-hand with tackling the root causes of the energy crisis.

Almost half of them now support the nationalisation of UK energy firms, according to a YouGov poll for the Times. Truss has pledged to suspend green levies, which fund energy efficiency schemes, placed on energy bills, and has said she backs fracking for shale gas if it has local support. She is also resistant to new onshore wind projects, and during one leadership hustings event said that seeing solar farms on what was farmland was “one of the most depressing sights” of the modern UK. A source in Truss’s campaign said she was “absolutely committed to green energy”, and had been vocal about the need to increase the supply from sources including wind and tidal power.",

China is a major nuclear power. “It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”. “I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. “Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.” “His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”",

that the chair of <strong>Latvia’s</strong> broadcasting regulator, <strong>Ivars Abolins</strong>, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, <strong>TV Rain</strong>, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”.</p> \n  <p>TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula.</p> \n  <p>It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, <strong>Alexei Korostelyov</strong>, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities.</p> \n  <p>The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported.</p> \n  <p>Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security.</p> \n  <p>TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content.</p> \n  <p>Its founder, <strong>Natal</strong><strong>ya Sindeeva</strong>,<strong> </strong>posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1600164844757405698\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"

The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet.</p> \n  <p>“Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.”</p> \n  <p>Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests.</p> \n  <p>“So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said.</p> \n  <p>Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday.</p> \n  <p>He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off.</p> \n  <p>Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations.</p> \n  <p>“It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-06T14:56:24.764Z\">at 2.56pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-638f4a208f08cb34a8f544bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-06T13:57:44.395Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials.</strong></p> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong> quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1600120841097707520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Western officials - Russia *ran out* of Iranian drones 2-3 weeks ago and is now \"anticipating a resupply\". <br><br>Still no sign of Iran supplying missiles to Russia; military relationship between the two countries remains under negotiation between them</p>— Dan Sabbagh (@dansabbagh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1600120841097707520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1600122366431875072\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Strikes on Russian airbases of last 30 hours will complicate future bombing missions against Ukraine but effect is likely to be primarily psychological. \"They [Russia] will have less confidence that anywhere is safe\" - said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity</p>— Dan Sabbagh (@dansabbagh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1600122366431875072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out.</p> \n  <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/iranian-made-drones-supplied-to-russia-after-february-invasion-says-ukraine\">has seen evidence</a> that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-638f48a18f0819dada4ed94f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-06T13:51:30.761Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hungary vetoes EU aid package for Ukraine</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Hungary has vetoed an €18</strong><strong>bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year.</strong></p> \n  <p>The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán,</strong> to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds.

Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. </strong>Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. </strong>Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday.</strong> The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. </strong>Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. </strong>“In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. </strong>Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports.</strong> The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down</strong>. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia,</strong> killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Spanish police intercepted</strong> <strong>three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga</strong>, police sources close to the investigation said.<strong> </strong>Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, </strong>according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being.

Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”.</p> \n  <p>“We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added.</p> \n  <p>Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims.

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The channel had been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the country’s critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where people have been marking the country’s Army Day today. Earlier we reported that the chair of Latvia’s broadcasting regulator, Ivars Abolins, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, TV Rain, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”. TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”. The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the country’s Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a “serious blow to freedom of information”. Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welle’s Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions. Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin. In a series of tweets, Gavrilița said justice would be carried out for “the innocent victims that died, were tortured and hurt during this cruel and unjust war unleashed by Russia”. She added: Ukraine is fighting for us all – for the freedom of the entire European continent. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted about his meeting with his Moldovan counterpart, saying that the pair had agreed to cooperate in air defence, energy and customer control. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border.

Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities.

Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I don’t know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. “It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,” he said. Read the full story here: The Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin, said shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city today. Kulemzin wrote on social media: Preliminary data shows that today six civilians were killed as a result of shelling in Donetsk, the number of wounded is being specified. Separately, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council. Maria Pirogova, who Pushilin said had been involved in the separatist movement since 2014, was “the epitome of kindness” whose life was ended “in its prime”, according to a tribute he wrote on his Telegram account. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached. The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry. The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin. A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover. Read the full story here: Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. The European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters that the EU must keep its promises to Ukraine. He said: Ukraine is a country at war. It desperately needs our support and we just cannot allow one member state to derail or delay this financial support. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The EU has promised to underwrite €18bn in cheap loans to Kyiv to keep Ukraine’s government afloat in 2023. The EU’s 26 other member states will now study how to move ahead without Hungary, although hope Budapest can be persuaded to change its mind. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Hungary, which has angered other member states with its sharp criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, may now find it harder to unlock EU funds. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, who chaired the meeting, said Budapest’s decision on €18bn for Ukraine would be considered alongside EU member state approval of Hungary’s coronavirus recovery plan. He added: The money will go to Ukraine: either it will be 27 or 26 member states that take part. We have to be able to send the money to Ukraine. The Green MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent critic of Hungary’s government, accused Orbán of abusing the veto like no one ever before. He said: He even takes funds for Ukrainian hospitals hostage for this … The EU will find ways to support Ukraine even without Hungary. But that means: more time, more effort, more costs. Viktor Orbán could not have given Putin a nicer present today. The centre-right Romanian MEP Siegfried Mureşan said the Hungarian veto was disappointing, adding: It is hard to regard this as anything other than cynical obstructionism. An American national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in July has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he does not have any identity papers.

Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.” Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said. Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday. He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations. “It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said. Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials. My colleague Dan Sabbagh quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out. The Guardian has seen evidence that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February. Hungary has vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year. The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds. The EU has sought to hold back some funds destined for Budapest because of rule-of-law breaches. The commission will now look at how to “provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January”, the EU’s budget commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said during a public session of the bloc’s finance ministers. Today’s Hungarian veto means decisions on other files on the finance ministers’ agenda – including a minimum corporate tax rate (which Budapest is also blocking), the Hungarian recovery plan and connected €5.8bn in grants, and the decision to freeze €7.5bn of EU funds for Hungary over corruption issues – were also postponed. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said: We were not able to adopt the package as a whole but we will not be discouraged. Our ambition remains that we will start disbursements to Ukraine in January. He asked the council to work on “a solution supported by 26 member states”, which would get around Hungary’s veto. The EU’s 27 nations have until 19 December to make a decision. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. Kuleba said Ukraine’s embassies in Romania and Denmark received such packages today. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the packages had been delivered to its embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Kraków, and the consulate in Brno in the Czech Republic. On Monday, Spanish police said they had intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefits from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, western Russia, 175 miles from the Ukrainian border. The governor of the region, Roman Starovoyt, said there had been no casualties and that the fire was “localised”. On Monday, Ukraine appeared to launch drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the attacks, but a senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times the drones involved on Monday were launched from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has confirmed that Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest series of swaps. Among those who were returned to Ukraine included dozens who had defended the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol, he said. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and warned of temporary difficulties in accessing its mobile app and website. The statement reads: The bank’s technological infrastructure is under an unprecedented cyber attack from abroad. The largest not only this year, but in the whole time the bank has operated. It added: An analysis of the DDoS attack indicates that it was planned and large-scale, and its purpose has been to interfere with the operations of banking services, VTB indicates. The majority of requests for bank services during the attack have generated from foreign segments of the internet, though there has also been malicious traffic from Russian IP addresses. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been visiting troops close to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy was pictured meeting soldiers and handing out awards to mark Ukraine’s armed forces day. In a Telegram post, the president thanked troops for their “resilience and strength”, describing them as “an outpost of Ukraine’s independence”. He added: I believe that next time we will meet in our Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 60 soldiers each in a prisoner swap today, according to Russian officials. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), wrote on Telegram: Another 60-60 exchange with Kyiv is taking place today. Shamsail Saraliev, deputy of the Russian state duma, wrote on his Telegram account: The Russian Ministry of Defence is conducting another exchange of prisoners of war today. Sixty Russian servicemen are returning home. The Russian defence ministry said it had returned 60 soldiers “who were in mortal danger”. My colleague Isobel Koshiw shares a video originally posted by the mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksii Reva, showing the extent of destruction in the key eastern Ukraine town. Russian opposition politicians are appealing to President Vladimir Putin to issue a decree to end the “partial mobilisation” that has seen hundreds of thousands of men called up to fight in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry announced in October the end to the military mobilisation order that Putin declared the previous month, but legal activists and media noted that only the Russian leader had the authority to end the mobilisation. The Kremlin said Putin would not sign any order, in effect allowing for future waves of mobilisation. The absence of a formal decree to cancel the mobilisation meant those already drafted could not leave the armed forces, according to Emilia Slabunova, an opposition councillor in Karelia in northern Russia. Military lawyers told Reuters that there were at least two cases where commanders refused to discharge servicemen. Slabunova said appeals against these refusals led nowhere, with courts siding with the commanders. She said: We, as councillors, represent our constituents and these appeals from us are the result of numerous appeals from citizens. Similar appeals were seen from opposition deputies in the Moscow, St Petersburg, Pskov and Veliky Novgorod regions, Reuters reports. All are members of the liberal opposition Yabloko party. The appeals said the lack of a decree “creates legal uncertainty” and “allows military commanders to deny citizens their discharge from service”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Blinken said President Vladimir Putin “started this war; he could end it tomorrow” and that there was “always an off-ramp” to end the war in Ukraine. He said: President Zelenskiy has said, we’ve said, others have said, that at some point this will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. And by that, I mean this: if Russia doesn’t succeed in its current gambit of trying to, in effect, get the Ukrainian people to throw up their hands – and again, they won’t succeed. In response to Blinken’s comments, Peskov said: That the outcome should be a just and durable peace – one can agree with this. But as for the prospects for some sort of negotiations, we do not see any at the moment. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Peskov was also asked about reports that Russia is set to launch a new wave of mobilisation of men to fight in Ukraine. As the BBC’s Will Vernon notes, the Kremlin spokesperson did not deny the reports. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Spanish police intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga, police sources close to the investigation said. Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. “Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. “In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,” he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”. “We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase in Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Russian Bastion systems, which have missiles with a flight range of up to 310 miles, were deployed on the island of Paramushir, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday. “Coastal servicemen of the Pacific fleet will keep a round-the-clock watch to control the adjacent water area and strait zones,” it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a Tuesday news conference that the government will closely monitor the Russian military activity, adding it has been intensifying in the far east regions in tandem with Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. Ukraine is working to restore power after Russia’s latest wave of missile strikes on Monday caused power disruptions across the country, as winter frost builds and temperatures plunge, AFP reports. Out of the 70 missiles launched by Moscow, most were shot down, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, but the barrage still hit Ukraine’s already battered infrastructure. Fresh power cuts were announced in all regions “due to the consequences of shelling”, national electricity provider Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The head of Ukrenergo said he had “no doubt that Russian military consulted with Russian power engineers during this attack”, judging by where the missiles landed. “The time that Russians chose for this attack was connected with their desire to inflict as much damage as possible,” Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told a Ukrainian news programme, explaining the attacks were launched as the country enters a “peak frost” period. “Our repairmen will be working on the energy system restoration.” The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU’s embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. While the market weighs the impact of sanctions on Russian supply, it was also watching a traffic jam of oil tankers off the coast of Turkey on Monday, with Ankara insisting on new proof of insurance for all vessels. A researcher at the investigative news outlet Bellingcat has posted video showing smoke rising from Kursk, Russia, where Ukraine launched strikes damaging an oil storage tank, according to the local governor on Telegram. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or report of an attack. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday, 6 December. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Below are the photographs originally posted by Starukh: Starovoyt did not specify where the drone originated. On Monday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine “attempted to strike” the Dyagilevo airfield in the Ryazan region and the Engels airfield in the Saratov region with “Soviet-made drones”. The drones were intercepted but debris fell and exploded on the airfields, the ministry added. It said that three soldiers had been killed and four others injured. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. A drone attack on an airfield in Russia’s Kursk region set fire to an oil storage tank, a local governor said on Tuesday. “There were no casualties. The fire is localized. All emergency services working at the site,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Yesterday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February.

It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships.",

                    "bodyText": "Mark Wilson was furious on receiving a message asking him to bring his energy account “back on track”. Ovo, which had taken on his supply after acquiring SSE’s retail arm, was proposing to increase his monthly direct debit from £102 to £168. Wilson* had built up £500 in credit, and had even reduced his direct debits previously as his regular payments were overshooting consumption. “This is the most outrageous and terrifyingly abusive email,” he wrote to Ovo. “How can I need to get back on track when I am not off track, never have been, and am not likely to leave the rails? This is bullying.” Wilson was not the only one to receive a nasty shock this winter, as some companies sought to increase customer direct debit payments – even for those who had built up healthy credit balances. It emerged last week that while Britons were sat indoors in woolly hats with the heating off to save on bills, suppliers had hoarded an estimated £9bn of customer cash by November last year, more than four times previous calculations. In Wilson’s case, Ovo later said readings passed on by SSE were wrong, apologised, and offered to reduce his direct debit payments. Typically energy customers on direct debits will build up credit during summer, when usage is low, and suppliers will run that down over the pricey winter months. However, the surge in wholesale gas prices, which began in 2021, has tested existing norms and exposed some of the cascade of suppliers that went bust while using customer money to fund their business. An industry row over whether customer deposits should be ringfenced ensued. Ofgem accused suppliers of using customers “like an interest-free company credit card” but later stopped short of ordering full ringfencing. Now – with energy suppliers already in the crosshairs over their treatment of often-vulnerable prepayment customers – there are fears this situation could be repeated as energy rationing and high prices play havoc with billing. The Guardian asked Britain’s biggest energy suppliers how they were treating customer credit balances. Centrica (British Gas) Total residential customers: 7.3 million Direct debit customers: About 3.75 million Centrica, which has been most vociferous in calling for ringfencing, said it has about £400m in customer deposits held in a separate account, holding about £130 per customer. The company’s division supplying household energy is expected to make a loss in the second half of its financial year, but a surge in wholesale gas prices has led the group to upgrade profit expectations three times as its finances are boosted by soaring wholesale gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The real question is whether customers can be repaid [their credit balances] on demand. We can, as this money is not being used for working capital. It is only used to buy energy,” a spokesperson said. Chief executive Chris O’Shea has also expressed concerns that suppliers are being paid government money upfront to cut bills, risking going bust while holding taxpayer cash. O’Shea was under pressure this week after it was alleged that agents working on behalf of British Gas had broken into homes to fit prepayment meters when there were signs that young children and people with disabilities lived in the properties. Eon Total customers: 5.6 million Direct debit customers: About 2 million Eon expressed dismay at Ofgem’s decision not to ringfence customer credit balances after the failure of about 30 energy suppliers, which ultimately cost customers billions. The supplier, which took overNpower’s retail arm in 2019, has called for a social tariff to prevent vulnerable customers from paying high energy bills. Eon declined to give an average customer credit balance or say how much in customer credit it held. Chief executive Michael Lewis told the Guardian: “Ofgem’s own report says companies were allowed to enter this market on a ‘free bet’, with the cost ultimately getting picked up by customers around the country. “Our view is that this ‘free bet’ has to end.

                    "bodyText": "The energy industry has thrown its weight behind a plan it says could save homes and businesses up to £18bn a year, by reducing the prices charged for electricity generated from sources other than gas. Energy UK, the trade body for the sector, said its proposals could cut £18bn a year from energy bills, including £11bn for businesses. This could deliver a saving for households of between £150 and £250 a year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to have met members of Energy UK to discuss the proposal and is said to be considering it seriously as an option to present to the next prime minister. The Conservative party will announce the result of a vote for its new leader on Monday, with Liz Truss widely expected to win the mandate. The voluntary scheme would work by separating the cost of electricity from sources such as nuclear, solar and windfarms from the sky-high prices being paid for electricity generated by burning gas in power stations. Gas prices have more than tripled since Russia began reducing the volumes pumped into Europe in the months before its invasion of Ukraine. At the moment, the way electricity auctions are designed means the price of all electricity is closely pegged to the price of gas. Under the proposals – first suggested by the UK Energy Research Centre – nuclear power stations and renewable electricity generators would be encouraged to sign up to a new type of contract. These contracts for difference (CfDs) would mean selling their electricity at a lower price, but one that was fixed and guaranteed over a number of years. Many older nuclear, solar and wind generators are on renewable obligation (RO) contracts, under which they sell at the current wholesale rate. The market structure has led to those on RO contracts benefiting from higher prices, potentially making windfall profits. Energy UK is urging ministers to make it possible for RO contracts to be exchanged for CfDs. Adam Berman, Energy UK’s deputy director, said: “The current energy market doesn’t allow customers to fully benefit from the cheapest form of electricity – domestically produced low-carbon generation. “This scheme would be a significant first step to decoupling gas from retail electricity prices. “Removing the link between gas and retail electricity prices will be complex and take time, but this solution provides a quick fix for up to 40% of our generation capacity.” The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, is also looking to reform the market in the long term to delink the price of electricity from gas. Several European countries are considering a similar move. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday the Treasury was examining several options to help consumers this winter. This could also include the Bank of England providing support to energy suppliers for hedging costs, which could allow consumer bills to be reduced. The energy supplier Ovo has put forward an alternative solution which would involve reducing the price of energy for domestic users, but only for a limited amount of units per household. Energy consumption beyond that level would be charged at a higher price. Why is the price of electricity pegged to gas? Typically, electricity prices reflect gas prices. This is because the types of energy needed to produce electricity for the UK are ranked, with renewables and nuclear prioritised ahead of coal and gas. The price of electricity is set every half hour by the margin cost of the last generating unit to be switched off to meet demand, typically gas. This pushes up electricity prices when wholesale gas prices rise. What is an energy contract for difference? Under these contracts, electricity plants are paid a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity in the UK. If the market price is higher than the strike price, the Low Carbon Contracts Company, which is wholly owned by the government, ensures these savings are passed on to consumer bills. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. The government uses this system, introduced in 2017, to support the development of low-carbon electricity generation projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes to protect developers from volatile wholesale prices. However, only about 15% of the total fleet of renewable power projects have a CfD; most are remunerated through the older Renewables Obligation Certificate payments. What are renewables obligation certificates? Under the renewables obligation model, designed for wind and solar, power generators receive the value of their electricity on the wholesale market, as well as an additional subsidy. Therefore, generators on these contracts have benefited from the soaring gas prices so far this year. • This article was amended on 1 September 2022.

Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s State Border Service has issued a video which purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. The US assesses that Russia has largely ceded its gains near Kharkiv and many retreating Russian soldiers have exited Ukraine, moving over the border back into Russia, a senior US military official said on Monday. However, the US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich did not specify the number of Russian prisoners, but said the PoWs would be exchanged for Ukrainian service members held by Moscow. Military intelligence spokesperson Andrey Yusov said the captured troops included “significant” numbers of Russian officers. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes.”",

The changes were among 11 agreements reached during the first meeting of energy ministers since the election of the Albanese federal government. The gathering of state, territory and commonwealth ministers on Wednesday came about a week after a gas shortage in several states prompted the market operator to cap prices. A deep cold snap also helped send wholesale electricity prices soaring in the National Electricity Market. The video-linked meeting was described by participants as “very collegiate”, and “very different” from previous meetings held during the Morrison government. Among the priorities was an agreement to order the Australian Energy Market Operator to be begin work on buying and storing gas “for situations exactly like the ones we faced last week”, federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen said. “Australians might be surprised to learn that that power did not exist, that [Aemo] could not procure some gas and keep it in reserve to be released for urgent and crisis situations,” Bowen said, adding it was technically possible with storage facilities “around the country”.

The new agreement “could reframe and reset existing priorities, frameworks and governance to ensure the sector can chart the course out of the current challenges, and set the sector up for a stable transformation towards decarbonisation,” the meeting’s communique said. Another agreement involved enhancing the powers of the regulators to ensure they have full transparency, particularly in the gas market, and to ensure that all behaviour is in the best interest of the market and consumers, Bowen said. There were, however, “no silver bullet, no magic answers” to lowering energy prices, he said, adding a lack of planning in the past had led to the crisis facing the sector. “We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage,” Bowen said. Coal-fired power plant reliability was also an issue discussed at the meeting, with ministers agreeing to work with rail authorities to secure black coal supplies “and with power station operators to get generation back online as quickly as possible”. Prior to the meeting, senior energy policy adviser for the Ai Group, Tennant Reed, said Australia was facing an “acute crisis”. Last week, market regulators had to intervene to put a limit on gas prices in Victoria and the Sydney market at $40 a gigajoule, or about four times the standard price. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a jump in global energy prices, and the exit of a gas retailer, Weston Energy, in late May sent companies scrambling for supplies, propelling local prices higher. With electricity prices partly set by the cost of gas, wholesale power markets have also risen several times the $87/megawatt-hour average during the March quarter in the eastern states. The lengthy cold weather snap has also elevated demand. A report by energy expert Hugh Saddler and published by the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy &amp; Disaster Solutions on Wednesday showed average wholesale power prices had been steady until March 2021 but had taken off since. “[O]ver the 12 months from May 2021 to May 2022, monthly median spot wholesale prices increased by over five times in Victoria and South Australia, six times in Tasmania and New South Wales, and seven times in Queensland,” the report said. Ahead of the meeting, scheduled for 4pm AEST, Victoria’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, highlighted the need for changes to federal settings on gas, saying not enough was being reserved for Australian use. Western Australia sets aside 15% of production for domestic use but there are no formal limits for the eastern states. Discussions of gas reserves, however, were a national responsibility, Bowen said, indicating the subject was not subject to energy ministers’ approval. “Energy ministers agreed governments must be ready to act to implement further measures should they be deemed consistent with both our domestic and international commitments,” according to the communique from the meeting. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ai Group’s Reed said the change of federal government should usher in closer coordination across states, territories and the commonwealth. “The early signs are that there’s a good new set of relationships,” he said. “And that is promising.” The coordination will also extend to senior officers working together and reporting back to ministers “on the potential for the aggregation of renewable energy and storage projects across the nation”. “ This would help identify significant supply chain and onshoring opportunities for manufacturing, minerals processing, and to manage global equipment supply and cost issues,” the communique said. The ESB had already begun work on post-2025 energy market design, including the proposed development of a capacity mechanism. According to the communique, advancing work on a capacity mechanism was “a priority to bring on renewables and storage to support stability for the national energy market”, with no mention of coal or gas. In a nod to energy retailers who are struggling to stay in business as they are caught between rising gas and electricity costs and fixed contracts with consumers, the Australian Energy Market Commission was asked to prepare an urgent review by July of the Retailer of Last Resort scheme. The aim is “to improve resilience in the system and better manage retailer failures”. Reed said “you could make a case for a capacity mechanism” but it was important that the design not lock in high cost and potentially high emission sources of energy. It would also not provide any near-term benefit to the market and would have to be designed to minimise disruption and avoid scaring off investors. Bowen’s comments on Wednesday echo those he made at a conference last October, where he said an Albanese government would set several tests for any proposal to lock in extra capacity and improve grid reliability. These implied it would not support a system which extended the life of coal power plants. “Firstly, it must be consistent with our emissions reductions ambitions, including net zero by 2050 and a strong roadmap to get there,” he said. “Secondly, it must encourage investment in renewable energy, rather than chilling it as many fear. “Third, it must be a bridge to dispatchable technologies like hydrogen, batteries and pumped hydro, not an indefinite subsidy for old technologies,” Bowen said. “And fourth, it must actually ensure that generators dispatch when needed.” Bowen noted that commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro had recently refused to dispatch electricity from its Colongra gas plant below the market price cap of $15,000, an act he said was “reprehensible”. New National party leader, David Littleproud, meanwhile, earlier renewed his calls for the Albanese government to consider support for nuclear energy and even convene a national energy summit – issues not expected to get much heed at Wednesday’s meeting. “Small scale modular nuclear power should be included in that conversation as a source of reliable energy and a way of reducing the emissions,” Littleproud said. “A national energy summit that convened pre-eminent scientists, energy experts, economists as well as political leaders would be a positive contribution for policy development,” he said. Littleproud said his party was “not advocating large scale nuclear power plants”, rather smaller ones, but wanted “an agnostic debate on all energy sources available to Australia”.",

Instead, she has been busy writing books (in 2016 she published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/17/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-the-actual-one\">memoir</a>, The Actual One, and last year, a novel called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/jane-is-trying-9781474600019\" title=\"\">Jane Is Trying</a>), podcasting and acting; her CV includes recurring roles in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/18/farewell-shameless-gallaghers-austerity-uk\">Shameless</a>, Man Down and Jo Brand’s social work sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/14/damned-review-takes-great-skill-find-humour-such-unfunny-subjects\">Damned</a>.

Nerdy, vivacious, kind and sharp-witted, Dobby is one of the most distinctive female roles in British TV comedy history.

At drama school she had harboured ambitions to become a serious actor and/or musician. “Me and my college boyfriend Tom used to sit up all night going: ‘I’m going to be in a Mike Leigh film, then I’m going to be in a Ken Loach film, then I’ll tour with Théâtre de Complicité.’ There was no talk of: ‘I’ll do theatre in education for a year then I’ll get turned down for an advert,’” she recalls, with an enthusiastic appreciation of her own ridiculousness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I got a bit inside my own head and was like: ‘Why are people here?

Her material included a song about Geri Halliwell’s dog, a lullaby for Katie Price, and one about a man putting his penis into a chip fryer. “The chorus was: ‘Eh, come on love, what’s the matter / Have you never seen sausage in batter?’ In a northern accent,” recounts Suttie, trying and failing to keep a straight face.</p> <p>As much as her camp, celebrity-centric material chimed with the gay scene, it was also a “real baptism of fire”. She struggled to win over audiences, and soon migrated to the mainstream standup circuit. There, she thrived. In 2007, <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2007/01/01/35414/isy-suttie-love-lost-in-the-british-retail-industry\" title=\"\">a Chortle review</a> of her first solo Edinburgh show, a one-woman romcom musical set in a Matlock supermarket titled Love Lost in the British Retail Industry, hailed her as a “modern-day Victoria Wood”.

I was aware of how good it was and I was very quiet and shy.” Off set, she found that Dobby had supercharged her standup career – not always for the better. She was promoted to the top of bills, and gigs were advertised on her Peep Show credentials. “I got a bit inside my own head and was like: ‘Why are people here? Are they here to see Dobby? What do they expect?’” She worried that audiences would presume it was her first foray into standup. The stress was exacerbated by the fact she believed her Edinburgh show that year wasn’t up to scratch, having felt pressure to do the fringe regardless as a rising comedian. “It can feel like a really long Edinburgh where you have to do a show every day and you’re not happy with it,” she says.</p> <p>Her new work is clearly not born of the same sense of Fomo: Suttie wasn’t planning on returning to standup when Jackpot’s concept came to her. It taps into a very different cultural zeitgeist than the irreverent, Heat magazine-adjacent spirit of the late 00s. Jackpot is part of a wave of comedy that muses, very amusingly, on the ways motherhood and identity intersect (see also: the work of standups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/17/god-i-was-disgusting-ali-wong-on-why-womens-bodies-are-the-last-taboo\" title=\"\">Ali Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/13/jessica-fostekew-hench-london-weightlifting-body-fascism-muscly\" title=\"\">Jessica Fostekew</a>, books by comedians Lucy Beaumont and Ellie Taylor and sitcoms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/24/motherland-series-three-review-immature-nit-ridden-and-thats-just-the-parents\" title=\"\">Motherland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/28/better-things-gets-better-pamela-adlon-triumphs-without-louis-ck\" title=\"\">Better Things</a>). It’s a theme that also runs through Suttie’s next TV project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/17/i-fell-on-my-arse-on-a-gucci-catwalk-michelle-de-swarte-model-standup-and-now-star-of-the-baby\">The Baby</a>, which tackles the topic of motherhood in a marginally more disturbing fashion. The horror-comedy follows Natasha (Michelle de Swarte), a contentedly childfree thirtysomething gradually losing all her friends to parenthood who is targeted by a homicidal infant: the child latches on to a new “mother” each time he kills his previous caregiver (and plenty of others along the way).</p> <p>Suttie plays Natasha’s newly pregnant best friend Rita – another deserter – and filming the show took her back to her pre-kids days. “I really, really related to Michelle’s character feeling bereft of friends when everyone around you starts having kids,” she says. “My first book was about that, really. In a way you do lose your friends when they have kids if you don’t have them, because it’s boring as hell to hear someone talk about their baby and be preoccupied, and not have a proper conversation with you.” </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ7K2Q9T-Ps\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zZ7K2Q9T-Ps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Baby is laugh-out-loud funny but also genuinely disturbing; one field-based scene literally gave me nightmares. Best of all, it’s packed with subtle, blisteringly evocative allegories for the specific hell – the boredom, the sleep-deprivation, the mania, the crushing sense of responsibility – that is caring for a very small child. One of the cleverest elements of the early episodes is the way Natasha turns into a martyr: she won’t let anyone else look after the baby lest it murders them, a neat parallel for the exhausting instinct many new mothers have to control everything.</p> <p>It’s something Suttie can relate to. “I remember not letting anyone else wash [her daughter] Beti’s bottles,” she says. “You’re so out of control of so many elements of it, like when they sleep, that you’re scrabbling to control what you can.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/07/robert-webb-doctor-heart-fail-back-sitcom-booze-twitter\">Robert Webb: ‘The doctor said my heart was about to fail. That got my attention’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, Suttie’s attempts to do it all after the birth of her daughter in 2014 took its toll in a dramatic way: she developed a condition called migraine-associated vertigo, partly because of the stress she was under. “I did the book tour, I was filming a lot, I was away the whole time – and I was spending a lot of time with her. I wasn’t sleeping much. Both Elis and I would be filming and we’d meet at a service station and swap Beti over into a different car. In the end it was like, ‘One of us has to pull back a little bit.’” Suttie ended up taking three months off work, even though, being “a perfectionist and a workaholic”, she didn’t particularly want to. During those months she realised not working wasn’t “right for me, but I shouldn’t be working as much. So it was a case of: what do I really want to do?”</p> <p>The answer seems to be a bit of everything. After our interview, I leave Suttie behind in the baby-garlanded coffee shop; she is staying to catch up on her reading in preparation for the new series of the Penguin books podcast she presents. It’s just one component of a life that takes in writing, acting, parenting, standup, podcasting and, of course, the odd foray into a haunted campsite or nuclear power plant. It may not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but Suttie has clearly worked out how to hit her own personal jackpot.</p> <p><em>Jackpot tours from</em><em> 22 August, starting at <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/isy-suttie-jackpot/\" title=\"\">London’s Soho </a></em><em><a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/isy-suttie-jackpot/\" title=\"\">theatre</a></em><em>; </em><em>The Baby airs on Sky Atlantic in July</em><em>.</em></p>",

Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office.</strong></p></li> \n   <li><p>The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: “<em>The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.”</em></p></li> \n   <li><p>Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-639f4f638f0834f3c057bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T17:36:43.573Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is the drone video footage showing the explosions in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine, which has been verified by the Guardian and Reuters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04c78790-5a83-40d4-8180-4ac375654758\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GK5h3EG98OE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T17:41:16.899Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-639f4ad28f0834f3c057bd9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T17:16:07.253Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f49696641e79f2a91f13c2d3a6871e3d5f57873a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f49696641e79f2a91f13c2d3a6871e3d5f57873a/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of smoke rising from buildings in an urban area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from drone video footage shows explosions in Ukraine’s eastern city of Bakhmut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube | Butusov Plus via Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T17:27:39.654Z\">at 5.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-639f442d8f0816e812ef2579\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T16:47:47.667Z\">4.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Moscow has denied it plans to increase the period of mandatory military service from six months to a year.</p> \n  <p>A video showing Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Fotin initially making the claim was later deleted, Sky News reported.</p> \n  <p>The Russian defence ministry said it is “not considering any changes to the legal code of the Russian Federation”, adding this is “concerning changes to the length of military service by conscription”.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-639f3d9a8f085e68205429cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dianetaylor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T16:20:49.892Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It has been more than three months since two of the UK’s most senior judges sifted through thousands of pages of evidence and heard opposing arguments from some of the country’s lawyers about whether or not the government’s controversial plans to send asylum seekers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a> are lawful.

worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe.</p> \n  <p>Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict.</p> \n  <p>He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”.</p> \n  <p>And he said the repercussions of the invasion were also being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders.</p> \n  <p>“Effectively we’re in the same struggle at one remove. When Ukraine was invaded at the decision of President (Vladimir) Putin, the gates of hell were opened and every evil force came out across the world,” he told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg.</p> \n  <p>“I was in Mozambique the week before I was in Ukraine where there is famine all the way up the East African coast,” he said.</p> \n  <p>“There is inflation … there’s an energy crisis, there’s suffering, there’s shortages of drugs, everything evil has been unleashed and until there is withdrawal and ceasefire we can’t make progress on reconciliation,” he added.</p> \n  <p>In the UK, he said, rising food and fuel prices at least partly driven by the conflict had resulted in a 400% rise in the past 18 months in people seeking help from food banks.</p> \n  <p>“We are seeing debt rising, pressures on families just at all sorts of levels,” he added.</p> \n  <p>Welby has been publicly critical of Russia’s war on Ukraine, calling its invasion in February “an act of great evil”.</p> \n  <p>Visiting Mozambique the week before his Ukraine trip, he travelled to the jihadist-hit Cabo Delgado region where he met survivors of the insurgency there.</p> \n  <p>Earlier this month, the US committed a further $2.5bn in food assistance to Africa, pledging to help the continent cope with rising prices blamed in part on Russia’s invasion of breadbasket Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>The Horn of Africa has been hit especially hard after successive failed rainy seasons, with the United Nations saying that aid has staved off fully fledged famine in Somalia.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T13:53:08.540Z\">at 1.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-639ef4488f0816e812ef2333\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-18T12:02:00.647Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Four people in the southern Russian region of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine were wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor of the region said, Reuters reported.</p> \n  <p>“Our air defence system was activated over Belgorod and the Belgorod region,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p> \n  <p>“Four people are known to have been injured.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move.It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: “The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. This is the drone video footage showing the explosions in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine, which has been verified by the Guardian and Reuters. Moscow has denied it plans to increase the period of mandatory military service from six months to a year. A video showing Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Fotin initially making the claim was later deleted, Sky News reported. The Russian defence ministry said it is “not considering any changes to the legal code of the Russian Federation”, adding this is “concerning changes to the length of military service by conscription”. It has been more than three months since two of the UK’s most senior judges sifted through thousands of pages of evidence and heard opposing arguments from some of the country’s lawyers about whether or not the government’s controversial plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful. On Monday at 10.30am, at the Royal Courts of Justice, they will deliver their judgment. Hayat (not his real name) an asylum seeker from Eritrea, lost both his parents when he was a child. He tried to find safety first in Ethiopia and then Sudan before managing to reach Russia in 2018 and then travelling on to Ukraine, where he claimed asylum. But no decision had been made about his case when Russia invaded Ukraine in February so, unlike Ukrainian citizens who were eligible to apply for a visa to come to the UK, he fled to France and arrived in the UK using the dangerous small boat route. “They have accepted thousands of Ukrainian refugees – so what about us? We are from the same place, so why are we being treated differently?” he asked. Here is my colleague Jon Henley’s coverage of the restoration of heating to Kyiv, announced this morning by the city’s mayor. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment, the city’s mayor has said, as Moscow unveiled plans to deploy musicians to the frontline in Ukraine in a drive to boost morale among its troops. Vitali Klitschko said on Sunday morning the capital was successfully “restoring all services after the latest shelling” and that “in particular, the capital’s heating supply system is fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Russia fired more than 70 missiles targeting Ukraine’s water and energy infrastructure on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the beginning of its invasion on 24 February, causing power blackouts and removing access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and across the country were below freezing on Sunday and forecast to fall to -6C (21.2F) by evening. Up to a third of the capital’s population of 3 million were still without electricity overnight in what officials called a “difficult and critical” situation. Full story is here: The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian soldiers training in the north of England. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move. It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. “I announce the initiative to hold a global peace formula summit this winter. The summit to unite all nations of the world around the cause of global peace. Stadium stands get empty after the match, and after the war cities remain empty,” he said. Zelenskiy had wanted to appear via video link before Argentina take on defending champions France at Doha’s Lusail Stadium for the final with an expected global audience of hundreds of millions, it was reported. Fifa did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but it appeared unlikely to give Zelenskiy a platform given its stance on political messages at the World Cup. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter that Fifa “shows a lack of understanding of the disaster that the Russian federation is dragging the world into by starting a war in Ukraine”. My colleague Julian Borger has written a piece on the role of computer software in the war in Ukraine – a “decisive weapon” in the effort to force back the Russian invasion. He writes: Inside, the weapon glows from a dozen computer screens – a constantly updated portrayal of the evolving battlefield to the south. With one click on a menu, the map is populated with hordes of orange diamonds, showing Russian deployments. They reveal where tanks and artillery have been hidden, and intimate details of the units and the soldiers in them, gleaned from social media. Choosing another option from the menu lights up red arrows across the southern Zaporizhzhia region, showing the progression of Russian columns. Zooming in shows satellite imagery of the terrain in sharp detail. It is called Delta, a software package developed by Ukrainian programmers to give their armed forces an advantage in a contest of which side can see the battlefield more clearly and therefore predict the enemy forces’ moves and strike them faster and more accurately. While many scenes from the war in Ukraine look like a throwback to the first world war, with muddy trench networks and blasted landscapes, the conflict is also a testing ground for the future of warfare, where information and its dissemination in instantly usable form to individual soldiers will be critical to victory or defeat. Read the full article here: Significant fighting is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut in Ukraine. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. Here are images uploaded today from the city. Russian military forces on Sunday shelled the centre of Kherson, the major city that Russian soldiers retreated from last month in one of Moscow’s biggest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, AP reports. Three people were wounded in the attacks, said presidential deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko. The southern city and its surrounding region have come under frequent attack since the Russian pullback. Volunteers in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv have made a Christmas tree out of camouflage nets, the BBC reports. After the holidays, the nets will be donated to soldiers fighting on the frontline. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, has posted an image of the tree on Twitter. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. And he said the repercussions of the invasion were also being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders. “Effectively we’re in the same struggle at one remove. When Ukraine was invaded at the decision of President (Vladimir) Putin, the gates of hell were opened and every evil force came out across the world,” he told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg. “I was in Mozambique the week before I was in Ukraine where there is famine all the way up the East African coast,” he said. “There is inflation … there’s an energy crisis, there’s suffering, there’s shortages of drugs, everything evil has been unleashed and until there is withdrawal and ceasefire we can’t make progress on reconciliation,” he added. In the UK, he said, rising food and fuel prices at least partly driven by the conflict had resulted in a 400% rise in the past 18 months in people seeking help from food banks. “We are seeing debt rising, pressures on families just at all sorts of levels,” he added. Welby has been publicly critical of Russia’s war on Ukraine, calling its invasion in February “an act of great evil”. Visiting Mozambique the week before his Ukraine trip, he travelled to the jihadist-hit Cabo Delgado region where he met survivors of the insurgency there. Earlier this month, the US committed a further $2.5bn in food assistance to Africa, pledging to help the continent cope with rising prices blamed in part on Russia’s invasion of breadbasket Ukraine. The Horn of Africa has been hit especially hard after successive failed rainy seasons, with the United Nations saying that aid has staved off fully fledged famine in Somalia. Four people in the southern Russian region of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine were wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor of the region said, Reuters reported. “Our air defence system was activated over Belgorod and the Belgorod region,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. “Four people are known to have been injured. Medical teams are taking them to hospital,” he said. Gladkov gave no further details of the incident. Three witnesses told Reuters that loud blasts were heard in the city on Sunday. Belgorod is one of several southern Russian regions where targets such as fuel and ammunition stores have been rocked by explosions since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine on 24 February. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. It said the establishment of two frontline “creative brigades” tasked with raising the morale of troops through providing entertainment and musical instruments among other things is “unlikely to substantively alleviate these concerns”. See the full briefing below: The people the Greeks called Scythians were formidable warriors and nomads who dominated the Eurasian steppe for more than 1,000 years from about 800BC – long before the creation of national borders. The fabulous gold weapons and ornaments they left behind ended up in museums across the region, many of them in Ukraine. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, however, much Scythian gold – along with millions of other priceless artefacts – has been looted or “evacuated”. Serhii Telizhenko, of the National Institute of Archaeology in Kyiv, who has been monitoring the wave of destruction, said he realised there would be losses after the invasion, “but I could not imagine the scale”. The time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine to reduce the risk of another devastating world war, but dreams of breaking up Russia could unleash nuclear chaos, the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger said. Kissinger, an architect of the cold war policy of detente towards the Soviet Union as secretary of state under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, has met Vladimir Putin multiple times since he first became president in 2000. The Kremlin says Kyiv must acknowledge Moscow’s annexation of southern and eastern regions. Ukraine says every Russian soldier must leave its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, however expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” Kissinger wrote in the Spectator magazine in an article entitled “How to avoid another world war”. Kissinger, 99, suggested that if it proved impossible to return to the status quo established in 2014, internationally supervised referendums in territory claimed by Russia could be an option. He warned that desires to render Russia “impotent”, or even seek the dissolution of Russia, could unleash chaos. Neither Ukraine nor any western state has advocated either path. “The dissolution of Russia or destroying its ability for strategic policy could turn its territory encompassing 11 time zones into a contested vacuum,” Kissinger said. “Its competing societies might decide to settle their disputes by violence. Other countries might seek to expand their claims by force. All these dangers would be compounded by the presence of thousands of nuclear weapons which make Russia one of the world’s two largest nuclear powers.” Russia may attempt to re-enact a version of its original invasion plans, Ukrainian military officials believe, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned this weekend that Vladimir Putin still has enough missiles to order more heavy strikes. The Ukrainian president was speaking in the aftermath of the latest wave of missiles to target his country’s critical energy infrastructure after Russia launched 98 rockets at 20 cities and towns on Friday. Officials said on Saturday, however, that repairs had been speedy with water supply restored throughout Kyiv and two-thirds of the capital now connected to electricity while the country’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, had been reconnected to the grid after suffering a total blackout. The infrastructure update arrived as a Ukrainian military commander warned Russia may again attempt to seize Kyiv after invading from Belarus in the north, potentially around the late February anniversary of when Putin first ordered his troops to invade. Mark Townsend and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv report here: Germany has inaugurated its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, built in record time, as the country scrambles to adapt to life without Russian energy. The rig in the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven was opened by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a ceremony on Saturday onboard a specialist vessel known as an FSRU, named the Hoegh Esperanza. He said from the boat: It’s a good day for our country and a sign to the whole world that the German economy will be able to remain strong. Agence France-Presse also reported that the Hoegh Esperanza sounded its horn as the chancellor, dressed in a hi-vis jacket, approached. The ship has already been stocked with gas from Nigeria that could supply 50,000 homes for a year, and the terminal is set to begin deliveries on 22 December. Germany plans to open four more government-funded LNG terminals over the next few months as well as a private terminal in the port of Lubmin. Together, the terminals could deliver 30bn cubic metres of gas a year from next year, or a third of Germany’s total gas needs – if Berlin can find enough LNG to service them. LNG terminals allow for the import by sea of natural gas that has been chilled and turned into a liquid to make it easier to transport. The installation of a protective dome has begun over the spent-fuel storage area at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, an official from the province’s Moscow-installed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov said the dome would protect against fragments of shells and improvised explosive devices carried by drones, Associated Press reported. The Russian-occupied plant in south-east Ukraine – Europe’s biggest nuclear power station – has been repeatedly shelled and its six reactors have been shut down for months. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently announced plans to station nuclear safety and security experts at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants to prevent any nuclear accident. The UN nuclear watchdog has already deployed a permanent mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant. Officials have reopened a popular Kyiv pedestrian bridge that had been damaged during an earlier air strike and were setting up a smaller-than-usual Christmas tree in a central square in the gloomy winter haze on Saturday. The vast space in front of the centuries-old St Sophia Cathedral is traditionally anchored by a hulking evergreen at Christmas, Reuters reported. But officials this year opted for a 12-metre (40ft) artificial tree festooned with energy-saving lights powered by a generator. Orthodox Christians make up the majority of Ukraine’s 43 million people. Klitschko said the tree was funded by donors and businesses and that no public celebrations would take place. Kyiv resident Iryna Soloychuk, who arrived with her daughter to see the tree just hours after another round of air-raid alerts wailed across the country, said: I doubt this will be a true holiday. But we should understand that we’re all together, that we should help one another. Here are some of the latest Ukraine images coming in on the wires. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally. Reuters also reported that Ukrainian officials said Russia fired more than 70 missiles on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the start of its invasion, forcing emergency blackouts nationwide and cutting access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and many places across Ukraine were below freezing on Sunday morning, with forecasts expecting them to dip to -6C (21.2F) in the capital by the evening. Kyiv is by far the largest city in Ukraine with an estimated population of about 3 million, with up to 2 million more in the Kyiv region. As of late Saturday, a third of the city remained without power. Sergei Kovalenko, chief executive of Yasno, which provides electricity for Kyiv, said late on Saturday that access to power has been increasing with each hour. He said on his Facebook account: The situation remains difficult and critical. Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. He said in his nightly address: The main thing today is energy. There is still a lot of work to do to stabilise the system. In Kyiv, the metro had stopped running so that people wrapped in winter coats could take shelter at underground stations. But mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday the service had resumed, while water supply had also been restored and 75% of the city’s population had heating back. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, power had also been fully returned, regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said on Saturday, after the strikes had left Ukraine’s second city without electricity. Ukraine’s national energy provider Ukrenergo had imposed emergency blackouts in response to the strikes, warning the extent of the damage in the north, south and centre of the country meant it could take longer to restore supplies than after previous attacks. The country’s energy system “continues to recover”, it said on Saturday. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, inspected the country’s troops involved in Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said on the Telegram messaging app: The head of the Russian military flew around the areas of deployment of troops and checked the advanced positions of Russian units in the zone of the special military operation. Reuters also reported the ministry said Shoigu spoke with troops “on the frontline” and at a “command post”. However, it was not immediately clear when the visit took place or if Shoigu had visited Ukraine itself. A short video posted with the statement showed Shoigu in a military helicopter and a couple of aerial shots of empty swathes of land. The announcement comes a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, held a meeting with the country’s top brass, including Shoigu, seeking proposals on how they think Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine should proceed. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a brief look at the latest news as it approaches 8.10am in Kyiv. Power has been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians after Friday’s barrage of Russian missile strikes against the country’s infrastructure, including its electricity generating systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address on Saturday: Repair work continues without a break after yesterday’s terrorist attack. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram on Saturday that heat had been restored for three-quarters of the capital’s residents and engineers were continuing to work to stabilise supply. However, half of the Kyiv province still lacked electricity on Saturday, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba was quoted as saying, with snow and rain complicating efforts. In other recent developments: Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. Rescuers have recovered the body of a one-and-a-half-year-old boy from the rubble of Friday’s Russian strike on a three-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region, the region’s governor said. In total, four people were killed in the attack on Kryvyi Rih, Valentyn Reznichenko said. Thirteen others, including four children, were injured. Russia has denounced a decision by Moldova to temporarily ban six television channels as “political censorship”. Moldova accused the channels of airing “incorrect information” about the country and Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Moldova has reached a short-term energy deal that will help wean it off its dependence on Russian natural gas, a senior official said on Saturday. The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, said the state gas firm Moldovagaz would buy 100m cubic metres of gas from domestic supplier Energocom this month. Russia’s campaign of strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure has largely consisted of air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles but has almost certainly also included Iranian-provided drones, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its latest intelligence update it also said Russia was probably concerned about the “vulnerability” of Crimea. A Ukrainian military commander has said Russia may try to invade from the north, potentially around the anniversary of when Vladimir Putin first ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Maj Gen Andrii Kovalchuk told Sky News the fiercest fighting might be ahead and appeared particularly focused on the possibility of Russian troops invading via Belarus, on Ukraine’s northern border, in order to target the capital. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said it is “unrealistic” to expect Kyiv to come to an agreement with Russia to end the war. “War must end only with its defeat,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying Ukraine would act with “required proportions of artillery, armoured vehicles, drones and long-range missiles”. A 36-year-old man was killed inside his car after Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Saturday morning, the regional governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. A 70-year-old woman was also injured after Russian troops struck a western district of the city with artillery and multiple rocket launchers, Yanushevych wrote on Telegram.",

                    "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will attack the “corrosive cynicism” on net zero that is hampering UK, and global, efforts to tackle the climate crisis, in a speech at the UN Cop27 climate summit on Monday. In a swipe at members of his own Conservative party, the former UK prime minister will contrast the success and spirit of optimism at Cop26 in Glasgow last November with the failures of governments – including the UK – to follow through on promises since. “Because the spike in oil and gas prices – and the consequent global inflation, the hikes in the cost of fertiliser and food, have had an impact here and everywhere, they have led some naysayers to a corrosive cynicism about net zero,” he will warn. Soon after the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow ended last November, some rightwing members of the UK’s ruling Conservative party – including many who originally backed Johnson for prime minister in the 2019 general election, but combined to help push him out of office in July – began to try to use the climate emergency as a “culture war” issue. They argued against the UK’s goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and set up a net zero scrutiny group of MPs to advocate for relaxing or reneging on the legally binding target. Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, which sent already rising gas prices soaring to record levels, added fuel to their efforts. Johnson, whose supporters have long claimed him as a green champion, will tell an audience at Cop27 on Monday: “We must end the defeatism that has crept in since last year, we must end Putin’s energy blackmail, we must keep up our campaign to end global dependence on hydrocarbons, and if we retain the spirit of creative and Promethean optimism we saw at Paris and Glasgow, then we can keep [the] 1.5C [limit on global temperature rises] alive.” Johnson is attending Cop27 as the guest of the Egyptian hosts. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak will also attend the Cop27 summit, having U-turned on his initial decision to snub the summit, which 110 world leaders will attend. He will hold meetings with French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s prime minister, Georgia Meloni, and President William Ruto of Kenya. He is also expected to raise with the Egyptian government the issue of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian democracy activist and blogger who is on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail. Sunak will commit the UK to triple its funding for countries to adapt to the effects of extreme weather, from £500m in 2019 to £1.5bn in 2025, but there will be no new money for climate finance – the spending will come from the £11.6bn budget already agreed before Cop26. Sunak will say: “The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperatures to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.” He is expected to herald progress on a UK initiative to conserve the world’s existing forests, and on ways to help communities where many jobs are currently dependent on fossil fuels to move to clean energy, the so-called “just transition”. Sir Keir Starmer, who is not at Cop27, will also mark the start of the conference by setting out proposals for clusters of net zero industry centred on steel, cement, ceramics and chemicals in areas including Humber and Teesside, Merseyside, Grangemouth and south Wales. Labour’s proposals would result in at least £1bn more invested in greening industry in the UK than under Conservative plans, Starmer will say. The money would come from a proposed National Wealth Fund. Labour accused the government of “dragging its feet on climate at every turn”, leaving British industry behind in the race for the clean and efficient technology of the future. Ed Miliband, shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The Tories have shown us over the past 12 years that they simply do not understand the scale of the [climate] emergency. If Rishi Sunak can’t provide leadership on the world stage, we cannot expect him to lead at home.” Labour’s policies include an energy price freeze, paid for by a more effective windfall tax, along with a green prosperity plan for a national wealth fund and a national energy champion, GB Energy, to invest in renewable energy and nuclear power. Miliband said: “This is a plan that will drive jobs, support industries, tackle the cost of living, and protect our home for future generations by tackling the climate crisis. There is a global race on for the jobs of the future, and Britain under the Tories is falling behind.” About 110 heads of state and government are expected to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday for a two-day world leaders’ summit at the start of the fortnight of climate talks. The negotiations got off to a difficult start when countries stayed up to the early hours of Sunday morning wrangling over what should be on the agenda for the conference. The vexed issue of loss and damage will be an official agenda item at the talks, which will allow discussions on how poor countries can be helped to recover from the ravages of extreme weather that they are already experiencing. On Sunday, the UK formally handed over leadership of the global climate talks, a position it has held since the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last November, to Egypt. Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who will chair the Cop27 talks, said Egypt was determined to hold countries to account for their promises to tackle the climate crisis. He said: “We must not go beyond the point of no return [on the climate]. We must preserve our planet for future generations.” Security has been tight in Sharm El-Sheikh, as world leaders began to arrive on Sunday night, and there are concerns among climate activists that their voices will not be heard at the talks.",

has reassured his Ukrainian counterpart that Athens is in lockstep with its EU and Nato allies in strongly condemning Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.</p> \n  <p>Using the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community in Prague to hold talks with Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, Mitsotakis said Greece would never recognise the change in borders, which he insisted was “in flagrant violation of international law”. Instead, he said, Greece saw the regions as an integral part of Ukraine and fully backed today’s EU council decision to impose a new package of economic and individual sanctions against Russia.</p> \n  <p>Mitsotakis and his centre-right government have said persistently that Greece has elected to be on the “right side of history” by supporting Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Support has included using the strategic port of Alexandroupolis, in north-east Greece, for the shipment by US armed forces of military material to Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>What were once traditionally strong ties with fellow Orthodox Moscow have been badly strained in the process. This week, Greece’s anti-money laundering authority confirmed it was also investigating what the Kathimerini newspaper described as the “suspicious transfer” of large funds from Russia to the all-male monastic republic of Mount Athos, where monies had been directed to Moscow-friendly monasteries and monks.

And I think that without Ukraine, Nato is not such a strong alliance, particularly the European continent. I believe for the strength in the east of Europe this is a very important step. We can offer this chance to Nato. We are grateful for their support to Nato. We are giving this opportunity at a very important moment.”</p> \n  <p>Zelenskiy appealed for his Nato partners to show resolve.</p> \n  <p>“Not only Ukraine has to demonstrate its strengths to Russia, but the alliance has also to demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia. It’s a question to Nato. But I know that everyone realises that security guarantees for Ukraine are something that is necessary. And I think we are on that path. We shall definitely take this path.

The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told European heads of state gathered in Prague that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”. Ukrainian emergency services said three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. Thank you for following the blog today. We’re closing it for now but will see you again tomorrow. Leaders of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Turkey met on Thursday to discuss the security and energy crises resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in a symbolic summit seen as underlining Moscow’s isolation. The gathering in Prague was the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), the brainchild of French president, Emmanuel Macron, and was intended to unite the EU’s 27 member states with 17 other European countries. The meeting at the ancient Prague Castle was perceived as a grand show of solidarity for a continent grappling with multiple crises - from the security implications of the war in Ukraine to energy shortages and a looming recession. “This meeting is a way of looking for a new order without Russia,” the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said, adding that Moscow may not always be excluded but for now, President Vladimir Putin’s Russia “does not have a seat”. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressing the meeting via video link, urged leaders to turn the new political community into a “European community of peace”. “Let today be the starting point. The point from which Europe and the entire free world will move to guaranteed peace for all of us. It is possible,” he said, calling on leaders to “direct all possible powers of Europe to end the war” in Ukraine. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent Peter Beaumont has penned a dispatch from the Kherson region, shedding light on residents’ experiences of returning to their homes in newly liberated villages. Unlike the wooded hills of the Donbas, the land here is flat, broad fields sectored by tree lines of acacia and oak, poplars and eucalyptus. They provided meagre cover for the Russian armoured vehicles that can be see burned out in the distance, sometimes several together. Razor-sharp shrapnel fragments litter the road’s surface. Lines of Russian anti-tank mines, strung together to close access to the road, have been defused and pulled to one side of the carriageway. Everywhere the skeletal remnants of missiles that once carried cluster bombs stand like tree-stumps in the fields. One meadow is cratered every 20 metres by the dozen or so munitions that flew into it. Beyond that, the road is heavily damaged. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has said it was “obvious” the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant belonged to Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday. In a press conference, Grossi said: For us it is obvious that since it is a Ukrainian facility, the ownership is Energoatom [the Ukrainian state nuclear agency]. With the safety and the security of the plant – and technical operation – we will continue to be guided by the agreements we have with Ukraine. We are an international organisation guided by international law and, as you know very well, annexations are not accepted under international law. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his government to take over operations at Europe’s largest nuclear power station in southern Ukraine this week. Shelling has hit the vicinity in recent months, with Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for the attacks that have raised fears of a nuclear disaster. US president, Joe Biden, has said he would not rule out meeting with Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit next month in Asia. “That remains to be seen,” the US leader told reporters when asked if he’d use the G20 gathering in Bali, Indonesia, as an opportunity to talk directly with Putin. However, travel plans for both men remain unconfirmed and the White House has said that if Putin attends the G20 summit, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, should also participate, even if Ukraine is not a member of the group. It is unclear whether Putin will attend the summit. Liz Truss has said she considers Vladimir Putin to be the shared foe of Europe for threatening democracy and pushing up energy prices, while her French counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron, is a “friend”. Truss’s comments during the Tory leadership race, when she declined to say whether Mr Macron was a “friend or foe”, were widely criticised. She told broadcasters in Prague, where she is attending the inaugural summit of the European Political Community and will meet with the French president: I work very, very closely with President Macron and the French government and what we’re talking about is how the UK and France can work more closely together to build more nuclear power stations and to make sure that both countries have energy security in the future. We’re both very clear: the foe is Vladimir Putin who has, through his appalling war in Ukraine, threatened freedom and democracy in Europe and pushed up energy prices which we’re now all having to deal with. Asked if Macron was then a friend, Truss said: “He is a friend.” A Russian-installed official in Ukraine has suggested President Vladimir Putin’s defence minister should consider killing himself because of the shame of the defeats in the war in Ukraine, representing an astonishing public insult to Russia’s top brass. After more than seven months of war in Ukraine, Moscow’s most basic war aims have still not been achieved, while Russian forces have suffered a series of battlefield defeats in recent months, forcing Putin to announce a partial mobilisation. In a four-minute video message, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of the annexed Kherson region, followed suit, publicly lambasting the “generals and ministers” in Moscow for failing to understand the problems on the front. Stremousov said: Indeed, many say: if they were a defence minister who had allowed such a state of affairs, they could, as officers, have shot themselves. But you know the word ‘officer’ is an incomprehensible word for many. Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza is being investigated for treason, according to his lawyer. State-owned news agency RIA has quoted lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying a criminal case for treason – which carries a sentence of up to 20 years – had been opened against Kara-Murza in connection with three of his public speeches. They included an address to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he said Vladimir Putin was bombing Ukrainian homes, hospitals and schools. Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians, but thousands have been killed in Ukraine. On Thursday, at least three people died when a Russian missile destroyed an apartment block in the city of Zaporizhzhia. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. AFP reports: The measures, which came into force with their publication in the bloc’s official administrative journal, also pointed the way to an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world but only after details are worked out within the G7 group of nations. The EU regulation said the sanctions were in response to Russia’s “further aggression against Ukraine, the organisation of illegal sham ‘referenda’ in the parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions that are currently illegally occupied ... the illegal annexation of those Ukrainian regions ... as well as the mobilisation in the Russian Federation and its repeated threat to use weapons of mass destruction”. Thirty individuals and seven entities were added to the EU blacklist, including singers Yulia Chicherina and Nikolay Rastorguev, among others deemed pro-war “propaganda” artists. Other listings were Russia’s electoral commission and its head, proxy Russian officials in the annexed regions, and Russian defence officials and defence-affiliated companies. The regulation also introduced a “circumvention” list on which individuals or companies helping banned Russian entities get around the EU sanctions would be placed. It was the eighth packet of sanctions the EU has imposed on Russia since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February. The last couple of sanction packets have been losing steam compared with earlier ones, as leading Russian trade, energy, banking, military and political sectors have already been hit. The headline measure in the latest sanctions was meant to be an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world. But the legal text published on Thursday did not set out how that would work, leaving it to future deliberations by the European Commission and EU member states in consultation with the G7. The sanctions include expanding a ban to all Russian cryptocurrency transactions, regardless of amount, and the widening of an existing ban on Russian imports, and broadening a prohibition on weapon sales to include personal arms. Also, electronic components that can go into Russian weapons, such as transistors, electronic integrated circuits, controllers, and aerial surveillance cameras are banned for sale to Russia. Additionally, the EU is barring service providers in several sectors from exporting to Russia, including in the fields of legal advice, architecture, engineering and IT consultancy. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent, Peter Beaumont, has shared his impressions from a road towards Kherson today, where he has observed what appears to be the remnants of a big fight, including burnt-out Russian armoured vehicles and cluster munitions. He saw a little farmhouse that had been occupied by three different groups of Russians, which was “smashed to bits and an absolute pigsty”. He could hear Ukrainian artillery far in the distance. He added: This doesn’t feel to me like a small straightening of their line and regrouping but a rout. US Aid has announced $55m (£49.3m) to repair pipes and infrastructure destroyed by Russian troops, to help keep up to 7 million Ukrainians warm this winter. Many recently liberated villages no longer have energy supplies, and residents have been forced to cook their meals outside around open fires. Temperatures are still relatively mild in Ukraine, though they are beginning to fall, and winters are notoriously harsh. An article in today’s Bild looks into a surprising story, in which a local dentist in the recently liberated village of Pisky-Radkivski claims that teeth contained in a horror photo posted by Ukraine’s defence ministry stating they came from a torture chamber are in fact those from his cabinet, and had gone missing after his house was looted by Russians. The dentist, named as Sergey, said: These teeth look like the ones from my collection that was looted here. I’m the only dentist here. So if they were found here, they must be mine. Nearby residents reported to me that Russians apparently used this to scare people. The report adds that although this claim may be untrue, it is certain that torture did take place in the village. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is speaking at the first meeting of the European Political Community today. He has told European heads of state that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”, according to reporting by Agence France-Presse. Zelenskiy called on Western capitals to supply his army with more weapons “to punish the aggressor”. Ukraine’s general staff has reported that the armed forces liberated 93 settlements since 21 September in north-east Ukraine, while the armed forces advanced 55km (34.1 miles) deep into Russian-occupied territory and took control of more than 2,400 sq km. Norway’s government will restrict access for Russian fishing vessels to its ports in the latest tightening of security after last week’s discovery of significant leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Russian trawlers will from now on only be allowed to visit three ports and must undergo security checks when they do so, Anniken Huitfeldt, the Norwegian foreign minister, told a news conference. Many more details need to be worked out within the G7 and the European Union before a price cap for Russian seaborne oil deliveries to third countries could take effect, EU officials have said. Reuters reports: The EU agreed this week to the eighth package of sanctions against Russia for waging a war in Ukraine, including an oil cap that would align the bloc with the US and the G7 group of the world’s most industrialised countries, including EU members France, Germany and Italy. But many details are yet to be agreed including the actual pricing mechanism, said the officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity. That means the EU’s decision is more of a first step towards putting in place an oil cap, rather than actually already implementing it. The officials said: Discussions on how the pricing will be set are still needed. They added there was “some time pressure” to figure out the more nuanced approach compared with the EU’s previously agreed blanket ban for European firms on providing insurance and banking services to Russian oil shipments that would otherwise kick in from December. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK’s Labour party, has issued the following statement on Liz Truss’s visit to Europe: I think it’s very important that the opportunity is taken to reassert and re-emphasise the unity of response that we have in relation to [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression and imperialism and I think that’s the single most important thing in relation to the meeting today. Whatever other issues we have with the government, in the UK, I’ve made it clear there will be no political divide in our support for Ukraine, and standing up against Putin’s imperialism. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has reassured his Ukrainian counterpart that Athens is in lockstep with its EU and Nato allies in strongly condemning Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Using the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community in Prague to hold talks with Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, Mitsotakis said Greece would never recognise the change in borders, which he insisted was “in flagrant violation of international law”. Instead, he said, Greece saw the regions as an integral part of Ukraine and fully backed today’s EU council decision to impose a new package of economic and individual sanctions against Russia. Mitsotakis and his centre-right government have said persistently that Greece has elected to be on the “right side of history” by supporting Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Support has included using the strategic port of Alexandroupolis, in north-east Greece, for the shipment by US armed forces of military material to Ukraine. What were once traditionally strong ties with fellow Orthodox Moscow have been badly strained in the process. This week, Greece’s anti-money laundering authority confirmed it was also investigating what the Kathimerini newspaper described as the “suspicious transfer” of large funds from Russia to the all-male monastic republic of Mount Athos, where monies had been directed to Moscow-friendly monasteries and monks. Several senior Russian officials have visited the Mount in recent months. Reuters has a quick snap that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked Ukrainian parliament to approve banker Andriy Pyshnyi as the new chairman of the country’s central bank. Earlier today, the parliament formally accepted the resignation of Kyrylo Shevchenko, who abruptly submitted his resignation on Tuesday, citing health reasons. Ukrainian emergency services said that a total of three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. Parties can file preliminary objections if they believe the court does not have jurisdiction in a case. In a letter to the UN in March, Moscow argued that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because the genocide convention does not regulate the use of force between states. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly with the court. Ukraine filed a case with the ICJ shortly after Russia’s invasion began, saying Moscow’s justification, that it was acting to prevent a genocide in eastern Ukraine, was unfounded. The next step in the case will be a hearing on the objections against the jurisdiction of the court. No date has been set yet, but it is expected to take place in several months’ time. Reuters has a report on the problems that Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine or fearful of being sent to fight have encountered upon fleeing to Kazakhstan. Worries about money, sudden large increases in housing costs in response to the Russian influx, and scarce jobs are compounded by pressures from family back home – some have even been accused by relatives of betraying their country. And the scale of the exodus has given rise to concerns from some Kazakhs who see the incoming Russians as a potential economic burden and even a security risk. Rents have soared in Kazakhstan and other central Asian nations – as well as Georgia, where some landlords have started adding a “no Russians” clause to their rental ads. The Kazakh government said this week that more than 200,000 Russians had entered the country since Putin’s announcement, and 147,000 had since left. No data is available on their final destinations, though some are thought to have headed to neighbouring former Soviet republics. About 77,000 have registered in Kazakhstan’s national ID system, a prerequisite for getting a job or a bank account. Uzbekistan’s government said on Tuesday it was strengthening border controls, with border guard troops to be involved in vehicle and cargo checks alongside customs officials. Some Kazakh businesses have publicly announced job offers for those fleeing the Russian draft, but some of those offers explicitly stated they were aimed only at ethnic Kazakhs. Reuters has posted a helpful summary of its Ukraine-related reporting from today: Ukraine said its forces have retaken more settlements in Kherson, one of four partially Russian-occupied regions that President Vladimir Putin formally incorporated into Russia in Europe’s biggest annexation since the second world war. A Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least one woman and leaving other residents trapped under rubble, the regional governor said. The bodies of two Russian soldiers lay bloating in trees on opposite sides of the road, close to the blasted hulks of the cars and the van in which Ukrainian army officers said the dead men’s unit was retreating into the eastern town of Lyman. Dozens of firefighters doused blazes in a town near Kyiv after multiple strikes caused by what officials said were Iranian-made loitering munitions, often known as “kamikaze drones”. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the battlefield reports. Putin signed laws admitting the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region into Russia in the biggest expansion of Russian territory in at least half a century. He also said Russia would stabilise the situation in the regions, indirectly acknowledging the challenges it faces to assert its control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, accused Russia on Thursday of “nuclear blackmail” over its seizure of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. Putin said he expected sanctions pressure on the Russian economy to intensify, in televised remarks from a meeting with government officials. The European Union gave its final approval for a new batch of sanctions, the bloc’s executive arm said. They include more limits on trade with Russia in steel and tech products, and an oil price cap for Russian seaborne crude deliveries through European insurers to align the EU with Washington. A crime scene investigation of the damages on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines has strengthened suspicions of “gross sabotage”, Swedish security police. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said Moscow might cut oil production to offset negative effects from price caps imposed by the west over Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Europe may limp through the cold winter months with the help of brimming natural gas tanks despite a plunge in deliveries from Russia, only to enter a deeper energy crisis next year, the head of the International Energy Agency said. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive to call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. US intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised a car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, the New York Times reported. The Opec+ group of leading oil producers decided to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day to stabilise the market, according to a Kremlin spokesperson. Dmitry Peskov also said that by agreeing to reduce output, Opec+ has confirmed its credentials as an organisation responsible for market stability. The Saudi-led Opec+ cartel at a Vienna meeting on Wednesday ignored pleas from the White House to keep oil flowing and agreed the cut, its deepest since the Covid-19 pandemic. Separately, Peskov said that the Kremlin is preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. The visit is likely to focus on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in southern Ukraine in territory that Russia has proclaimed its own. He added that he understands there are no plans to invite Moscow to join an investigation into Nord Stream gas leaks. Nevertheless, Russia considers it is impossible to conduct such an investigation without Moscow’s participation. The Kremlin has denied reports that 700,000 Russians have fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive that it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. In a briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not have exact figures for how many people had left the country since Vladimir Putin’s announcement on 21 September of a “partial mobilisation” that has called members of the general public up to the military. During today’s Kremlin briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked about Wednesday’s New York Times report, which revealed that United States intelligence agencies believed parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist. The report said that US officials feared this was an element of a covert campaign that could widen the conflict. Peskov’s response was that Russian intelligence had always argued that Ukraine was behind the August killing of Darya Dugina so it was “positive” that the United States appeared to share that assessment. Kyiv on Thursday rejected the claims it was involved in the attack. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog – if there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne, that at least two had died and at least another five were trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved a three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspilne reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised”, in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” he told reporters. The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to Rachel Hall. I will be back later on. Here is a video clip showing some of the scenes in Zaporizhzhia after today’s attacks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Nato to “demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia”. During a video-link interview with the Lowy Institute in Australia on Thursday, Zelenskiy was asked whether he had received any response from Nato, and how quickly he expected the alliance to act on the application. He said his key message was: “You don’t need to be afraid of anyone.” Zelenskiy said it was important to build “security guarantees for the whole world so that nobody would have even a thought to become autocratic, and even if you’re autocratic that you shouldn’t have even a single thought that you can conquer the other territories or other nations”. “For that, you must have to be united. And I think that without Ukraine, Nato is not such a strong alliance, particularly the European continent. I believe for the strength in the east of Europe this is a very important step. We can offer this chance to Nato. We are grateful for their support to Nato. We are giving this opportunity at a very important moment.” Zelenskiy appealed for his Nato partners to show resolve. “Not only Ukraine has to demonstrate its strengths to Russia, but the alliance has also to demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia. It’s a question to Nato. But I know that everyone realises that security guarantees for Ukraine are something that is necessary. And I think we are on that path. We shall definitely take this path. How fast it’s going to be, unfortunately, it depends not only on Ukraine.” Zelenskiy announced last week that Ukraine was officially applying for membership of Nato, after Vladimir Putin said he was annexing four Ukrainian provinces. Maria Zakharova is giving her weekly press briefing for Russia’s foreign ministry. So far she has stated that it would be impossible to investigate the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines without Russian involvement, and accused Denmark of being unwilling to cooperate and said that the west was creating obstacles to the repair work. She criticised Ukraine’s contribution to the grain export deal, saying it was depriving grain exports to poorer countries, and denied claims that Russia had damaged grain silos or agricultural land, reiterating that the armed forces of the Russian Federation only target military infrastructure. Reporter Kateryna Malofieieva is in Zaporizhzhia and has posted to say that rescue work in the Ukrainian city is being interrupted by air-raid sirens that force first responders to shelter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on this morning’s attacks on Zaporizhzhia, saying: Overnight, seven Russian missiles have hit people sleeping peacefully at their homes in Zaporizhzhia. More have struck during the day. Russians keep deliberately striking civilians to sow fear. Russian terror must be stopped — by force of weapons, sanctions, and full isolation. Here are some of the images of the aftermath from today’s attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia by Russian forces. The UK’s ministry of defence has published this map today of how it assesses the latest territorial situation on the ground. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has said overnight Russian forces shelled across the front line in multiple locations. He reported that one civilian was wounded and that houses were damaged in several settlements. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the regions that Russia claims to have annexed without fully controlling the territory. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he hopes a vote at the UN general assembly next week condemning Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory will be “as unanimous as possible”. Zelenskiy is addressing the Sydney-based Lowy Institute by video link on Thursday. In his opening remarks, Zelenskiy urged Australia to help secure an overwhelming UN vote against Russia’s actions: “I’m asking Australia to use all of its influence to convince as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for international law and against a Russian annexation.” Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, Oleksandr Starukh, has issued an update on the strikes in Zaporizhzhia this morning, revising the death toll down to one for now. He writes: So far it is known about the death of one woman. The death of another person has not been confirmed. Thanks to the doctors, her life was saved. Seven people were injured of varying degrees of severity, they were treated, including one three-year-old child. The rescue operation is still ongoing. The number of victims may vary. The number of victims could have been much higher, but thanks to the timely and professional actions of the Zaporizhzhia state emergency service, 21 victims were already saved. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building on early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne at least two have died and at least another five are trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspline reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said on Telegram: “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. Russia launched two rockets at the central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytsky, but both reportedly missed their targets. Elsewhere, Russia used what the Ukrainian authorities say are Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones to target the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Ukraine’s military say they managed to shoot down 18 additional drones before they reached Odesa and Mykolaiv. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reported, the Iranian drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, the drones are designed to be flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings, exploding on impact – explaining their description as kamikaze drones. The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia region which Russia claims to have annexed. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has commented on today’s strikes on Zaporizhzhia, saying: The Russian attack on residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia is another shameful act of terror against the population of Ukraine. Thousands of innocent adults &amp; children have paid with their lives for Putin and Lukashenko’s war. They lose on the battlefield &amp; take revenge on civilians. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, has alerted people to an another attack on Telegram, posting “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. If you need a reminder, this animated map posted by Ukraine’s minister of defence Oleksii Reznikov yesterday shows the territory that the Ukrainian armed forces have claimed to recapture during their counteroffensive over the last month. The BBC’s Paul Adams reports hearing three more loud explosions in Zaporizhzhia in the last few minutes. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in the occupied region of Kherson which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, has been very vocal on Telegram in the last couple of days, attempting to counter any narrative that Ukrainian forces are making any progress in the south. This morning he has, without presenting evidence, again asserted that the defences in Kherson are holding. He said: The situation in the Kherson region is unchanged. The Kherson region is holding back the onslaught of the Ukronazis who are trying to break into Kherson. We repeat once again that despite the panic that is dispersed in the media, in the Kherson region, the ministry of defence and the Russian Guard stand to the death. The advances of the Ukronazis, fascists, Germans, Americans and other mercenaries have been stopped. The Russian Federation has signed into law an annexation of the Kherson region, despite not fully controlling it. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” Reuters reports he told reporters in Prague. The Kremlin has published details of the decree that Vladimir Putin signed yesterday to “correct” aspects of the partial mobilisation. Russian state media RIA Novosti reports: According to the decree, the deferment is granted to those who receive education of the appropriate level for the first time in full-time and part-time (evening) forms of education. Students, graduate students and residents enrolled in state-accredited programmes of secondary and higher professional education also have this right. In addition, the basis for the postponement will be training in organisations located on the territories of innovative scientific and technological centres, as well as in spiritual educational organisations. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has confirmed that seven Russian rocket attacks hit the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. It says that first responders are present, and that “work is ongoing, all relevant services are on site”. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, earlier said that one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Images posted by the ministry included pictures of debris on fire, and rescue workers clambering through the rubble of a destroyed high-rise building, which had collapsed on to cars parked in front of it. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, said on Telegram: “Dozens of people are under the rubble. The number of victims increases every hour. This is how the Russian terrorist hits civilians with its ‘high-precision’ weapons. It hits civilians and infrastructure, because it demonstrates to the whole world its worthlessness on the battlefield.” The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia oblast, one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex, despite not controlling all of the territory there. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram to report no casualties overnight in his region. However he says that the region was again attacked by Shahed-136 “kamikaze drones”, and that some residential and farm buildings as well as agricultural lands has been damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed authorities in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, occupied Ukrainian territory which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, have issued casualty figures for the last 24 hours. They claim that six civilians have been wounded and three killed by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. Additionally they say that 12 houses and five civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London, you can reach me on martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand you over to my colleague Martin Belam here is a rundown of where things stand as of 9am in Ukraine. Two people have been killed after Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was allegedly hit by Russian missiles in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday.

Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. European leaders are set to meet in Prague on Thursday in the face of Russia’s war. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to Russian television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin journalist who travels with with the Russian army, added: “We do not have enough people … fatigue has set in … there is no longer any strength left to hold on to the territories won.” Two people have been killed after an alleged Russian missile attack hit Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least 5 people are under the rubble of buildings,” Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. “Many people were saved. Among them is a three-year-old girl, the child is in foster care. A rescue operation is underway at the scene.” Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. Bodies of Russian soldiers, shredded uniforms and burned out military vehicles litter parts of Lyman in Ukraine after it was liberated from Russian occupation. The city in Donetsk became the latest strategically important city Russian occupiers surrendered as the Kremlin faces heavy losses. The gains by Ukraine come after Russia illegally claimed four territories as its own last week. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies have denounced the votes in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as illegal and coercive. A western-drafted UN General Assembly resolution would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation” of the areas where voting occurred. Meanwhile, the UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with annexing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The referendums have been dismissed as a “sham” by the west. “With the purported annexation... the Russian Federation has taken steps which deepen rather than resolve the conflict, and exacerbate the human rights violations associated with it,” Salazar Volkmann said. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Those set to meet also include the leaders of Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv as his prime minister will stand in for him at the talks, according to AFP. British Prime Minister Liz Truss is set to tell fellow leaders: Europe is facing its biggest crisis since the Second World War. And we have faced it together with unity and resolve. We must continue to stand firm - to ensure that Ukraine wins this war, but also to deal with the strategic challenges that it has exposed.” Despite the rhetoric there are expected to be few concrete results from the summit. EU officials expect to agree to hold a follow-up gathering of the community in six months’ time in a country outside the bloc, with Britain and Moldova both offering to host. Unconfirmed reports of shelling in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia has damaged or destroyed several residential buildings overnight leaving some residents trapped under rubble, according to the region’s governor. “As a result of the enemy attacks, fires broke out in the city,” Oleksandr Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app early on Thursday morning. “There are possible casualties. Rescuers are already pulling people out from under the rubble.” Starukh later alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” and said the number of victims is still being clarified. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw brings us this dispatch from Kyiv. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. The Russians forced Ukrainians they suspected of collaborating to collect bodies and bury them. One boy, who was detained by the Russians and forced to bury bodies, told Hromadske that some of the bodies were left lying on the street for a long time. More evidence of tortured and extrajudicial killings has been discovered in Kharkiv region. Two civilians corpses aged 30-35 were found in a grave in the village of Novoplatonivka, Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian authorities. The left hand of one man was handcuffed to the right hand of the second man. Investigators said one of the skulls was fractured and the other had suffered a gun shot wound to the head. Kharkiv prosecutors and police said 250-350 Russian special forces were stationed near the grave. They said their initial suspicion is that the men were killed by Russian special forces. In Pisky-Radkivskyi, another village in Kharkiv region, Ukraine authorities said they found another torture chamber. Serhii Bolvinov, chief investigator for Kharkiv region said: “Neighbours constantly heard screams from here. Investigators found a terrible torture chamber in the village. “Police have been made aware of the torture of burying people alive and the use of a gas mask with a smouldering rag.” Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. In the Kherson region, Ukraine has extended its area of control by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised” during a Wednesday evening address. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said Russia’s withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear for now. Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, said his soldiers “continue moving forward” in its autumn offensive. “While the ‘Russian parliament’ is intoxicated from the futile attempts at annexation, our soldiers continue moving forward,” he said in a Twitter post on Thursday. “This is the best answer to any and all ‘referenda’, ‘decrees’, ‘treaties’ and pathetic speeches.” The UN nuclear agency chief will shortly arrive in Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Putin earlier signed a decree ordering the Russian government to take control of Europe’s largest atomic plant and make it “federal property”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss safety at the plant, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia will “stabilise” the situation in the four Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday: We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise.” His comments appear to indirectly acknowledge the challenges Moscow faces to assert its control. When later asked by journalists whether there was a contradiction between Russia’s annexation rhetoric and the reality on the ground, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was none. There is no contradiction whatsoever. They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. In the Kherson region, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military has made major advances against Russian forces and recaptured the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka during a Wednesday evening address. The UN nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, will shortly arrive in Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. Here are all the major developments you may have missed: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”.

Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: “I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said. A SpaceX rocket carrying Russian cosmonaut, Anna Kikina, the only female cosmonaut in service, soared into orbit from Florida on Wednesday. The International Space Station crew comprising Kikina, two Americans and a Japanese astronaut flew together in a demonstration of US-Russian teamwork in space despite Ukraine war tensions.",

                    "bodyText": "The government plans to resuscitate the UK’s nuclear energy ambitions by creating a financing model that could pile part of the upfront cost of the £20bn Sizewell C power plant on to householders’ energy bills before it starts generating electricity. The energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out legislation on Tuesday that would share the early construction costs with consumers, with the aim of reducing the UK’s reliance on overseas funding for nuclear projects by making them more attractive to domestic investors. The long-awaited legislation could also pave the way for the government to take a direct stake in the Sizewell C nuclear plant by using tens of millions of pounds of public money during its risky development phase – replacing the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), which has a 20% share of the project. Kwarteng said the existing financing scheme, which was used to back the Hinkley Point C nuclear scheme in Somerset, had led to “too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years”. The legal backing for a new financing model is expected to help clear the way for the energy firm EDF to build Sizewell C in Suffolk after years of wrangling over how to fund the huge upfront cost of constructing a nuclear plant. Under the new financing framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, EDF would start earning money – collected from energy bills – long before the reactor begins generating electricity. The government said each household would not have to pay more than a few pounds a year extra on its bills to support the project during construction, but Sizewell C could save households more than £30bn over the facility’s lifetime. The plant, which is still going through the planning process, could eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, concerns about costs and the involvement of state-owned CGN. CGN is a minority partner in EDF’s Hinkley Point scheme, and is interested in building its own reactor at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex. However, its involvement in the nuclear industry has faced growing worries over national security. The US has urged the UK to cut the company from its nuclear programme. Kwarteng said: “We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations.” The government’s nuclear ambitions have foundered in recent years, with companies including the South Korea power utility company Kepco and Japan’s Hitachi and Toshiba abandoning plans to build in the UK. Greg Hands, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the legislation would help the UK to build “the new nuclear power stations we need to ensure a resilient, low-carbon electricity system for future generations. “This finance model will also support the UK’s thriving civil nuclear industry, which currently employs 60,000 in high-skilled jobs, and help create thousands more as we level up opportunities across the whole country.”",

Many in the environmental movement argue that capitalism and its “infinite accumulation on a finite planet … is the root cause of climate breakdown”, writes Saito. But because Marx’s writings on ecology have often been marginalised, there’s a view that his socialism is pro-technological and anti-ecological – supporting the development of technologies to lay the foundation for a post-capitalist society and ignoring nature’s limits, believing it can be dominated by humans. According to Saito, it is possible and necessary to reconstruct Marx so we can see how he analysed economic <em>and </em>ecological crisis.</p> <p>Saito first studied Marx when he was an undergrad at the University of Tokyo, trying to understand degrading working conditions among temporary workers in Japan. After the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, he realised “how capitalism is not just simply exploiting workers but also seriously degrading the environment”. Influenced by scholars who made the case for Marx as an ecological thinker – including Paul Burkett and John Bellamy Foster – Saito sharpened his analysis studying in the US and began to learn German before his next move.</p> <p>It was in Berlin, where he researched his PhD-cum-<a href=\"https://monthlyreview.org/press/karl-marxs-ecosocialism-wins-deutscher-memorial-prize-2018/\">award-winning book</a>, that he became involved in editing the new complete works of Marx and Friedrich Engels, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe\">Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe</a>, including some of Marx’s long-neglected notebooks. “If you look at his notebooks, one realises he studies two weird fields: one is natural science and the other one is capitalist societies.” While Marx was supposed to be finishing Volume II and III of Capital, he was “actually studying natural science, chemistry, geology”. This shift points to a vital change in Marx’s thinking, argues Saito. “With his growing interest in ecology,” Saito writes, “Marx came to see the plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central contradiction of capitalism.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db35a6b8f51c221512f5983c4076ffd4da106028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db35a6b8f51c221512f5983c4076ffd4da106028/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discarded secondhand clothes cover the beach in Jamestown in Accra, Ghana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discarded secondhand clothes cover the beach in Jamestown in Accra, Ghana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muntaka Chasant/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By synthesising these different approaches, Saito developed a “unique way of reading Marx”, he says, as a “degrowth ecological communist”.</p> <p>Degrowth argues that economic growth – the holy grail for governments in most countries – is simply not sustainable and that to stop climate breakdown, we need to reduce consumption. Saito cites <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04412-x\">Jason Hickel’s work</a> as one example. He is conscious of the critique that denying many countries in the global south the chance to “develop” in the way the north has could be destructive to people who are already very poor. Woven throughout Marx in the Anthropocene is a mindfulness of this global imbalance. “Like many degrowth people I limit the scope of the argument to the global north, developed countries like the UK, Japan and the US. I am obviously pro-growth for those poor countries in the global south.” What is needed to achieve that is a new idea of “abundance” and “progress”, Saito says. Everyone on the planet should have access to the basic things we need to live – electricity, water, education – but “we need to come up with a vision where mass production, mass consumption and mass waste can be avoided.”</p> <p>Crucial to imagining this alternative world is another strand of thinking in Marx’s notebooks: his interest in pre-capitalist, non-western societies. Contra to the ethnocentrism in some of his earlier work, in the end, Marx emphasised “the importance of learning” from these parts of the world “for the western societies”. Informed by this and his ecological studies, Marx’s idea of communism changed significantly, and was no longer growth-driven. “The pre-capitalist society had a unique way of communal regulations of land,” Saito says, “and they also imposed various rules on their production and consumption which realised a more steady-state of sustainable production.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ba36a93977e96a39e4e2f30df618a1b0b9fae5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ba36a93977e96a39e4e2f30df618a1b0b9fae5b/0_1395_5584_5579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kohei Saito\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kohei Saito</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Coiurtesy of Kohei Saito</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, you may wonder why such a deep engagement with a 19th-century thinker matters today. Saito argues that Marx’s way of understanding the relationship between humans and nature – encapsulated in the theory of “metabolic rift”, a vigorously debated subject in Marxist circles – can determine how we respond to the climate and ecological crisis we now face. The basic premise of this thesis is that human/nature interaction is the “basis of living”, but capitalism organises “human interactions with their ecosystems” in such a way that it creates “a great chasm in these processes and threatens both human and nonhuman beings”, Saito says. Some criticise this concept, arguing that it divides nature and society so as to ignore how the former is completely transformed by capitalism. But Saito doesn’t agree.</p> <p>His use of the term <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-the-anthropocene.html\">Anthropocene</a> is meant to recognise that the “entire planet is now fully transformed by our economic activities”, but he rejects that this means we don not have to distinguish between nature and society. If we understand the two as the same, Saito argues, we risk believing environmental problems can be overcome through more human intervention. We must be attuned to the differences to grasp what “we cannot change” – such as temperature increases due to CO<sub>2</sub> and the natural chain reactions that flow from that – and what we can: most urgently “the fossil fuel industry”, Saito says.</p> <p>This makes him sceptical of technological utopianism. Though he had once been optimistic about the possibility of technological progress, he now sees the limitations. “By hoping there will be new technologies, we simply wait until they will be invented but the result will be they will never be and we will be all dead,” Saito says. This is not just a criticism of much-lauded technological fixes within capitalism, such as carbon capture and storage, but of the idea that we can transfer capitalist technologies to an automated communist utopia – where collectively owned robots do the vast majority of the work and there is no more resource scarcity thanks to green energy and things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining\">asteroid mining</a>.</p> <p>Saito welcomes these attempts for imagining a post-capitalist world but sees them as ultimately misguided. “This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of people’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of living in the global north,” he observes. “Such a vision accepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c4cdafda3b3fa1120ffa45e2a6d2201ca2427f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c4cdafda3b3fa1120ffa45e2a6d2201ca2427f1/0_0_6084_3958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man fishes near a steel plant in IJmuiden, in the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man fishes near a steel plant in IJmuiden, in the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Capitalism doesn’t just flout natural scarcity, caring little for the planet’s limits, Saito argues – it artificially creates a social scarcity, where we are always compelled to want more: the latest phone, car or jacket. But we can reorganise our relationship with nature, Saito insists, to imagine a new kind of abundance: regulating advertising, SUV usage and constant mobile phone model changes while “distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members of the society”. Some sectors – those that don’t make a profit and so are underdeveloped in capitalism – would be improved, which would mean more money and resources for “education, care work, art, sports and public transportation”. </p> <p>Saito maintains this is not a miserabilist alternative future. Pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/pandemic-covid-19-work-society\">Kate Soper’s thinking,</a> he says that the constant need to engage in competitive work and consumption is not a mark of the good life and in fact limits opportunities for fulfilling experiences outside the market. Without the need to produce for excessive, unnecessary consumption (that which is “necessary” for economic growth, not the development of the individual), jobs could be fundamentally changed. We could spend far fewer hours working, using our abilities and talents to do what we can and sharing the unpleasant and boring tasks more fairly. </p> <p>Saito, though, does not see this as a romanticised “return-to the countryside”, abandoning all technologies in the process; nor is he a Soviet Marxist. Using André Gorz’s distinction between “open” and “locking technology”, he advocates for the former. While the latter is “about domination over people and nature”, where “technology is for discipline and monopoly” – he gives nuclear power plants as an example – open technologies can be run at a local level by cooperatives. Solar panels, for instance, are a more democratic way of “controlling energy and electricity”, he says. This doesn’t amount to doing away with the state entirely, but he stresses: “My vision is not Soviet-style – I am not arguing for the state ownership of everything or state-planned economy.” That would simply change too little.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bb337212d3c5d165ee54b33241b75fe60823b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb337212d3c5d165ee54b33241b75fe60823b8c/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist with a banner that says “Overconsumption = Extinction” gatecrashes a show at Paris fashion week in 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist with a banner that says “Overconsumption = Extinction” gatecrashes a show at Paris fashion week in 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One question, though, is how possible any of this actually is. Saito is aware of the challenges, but he points to Gen Z, Just Stop Oil, climate protests around the world, and Alberto Garzón, the Spanish minister for consumer affairs, <a href=\"https://la-u.org/the-limits-to-growth-eco-socialism-or-barbarism/\">who recently wrote about the limits of growth</a>. This is a big change compared with the past 30 years, when such movements have been marginalised. “I am hoping the 2020s and 2030s will become much more turbulent as the crisis deepens,” he says, and hopes that the amount of radical protest will grow and changes in our values will continue to accelerate.</p> <p>“What I am trying to do,” Saito says at the end of our conversation, “is, inspired by these movements, offer something for them … I tried to show why it is necessary to criticise capitalism and why socialism or communism can be a more solid foundation for their movements too.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/marx-in-the-anthropocene/D58765916F0CB624FCCBB61F50879376\">Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism</a> is published by Cambridge University Press on 28 February</p></li> </ul>",

This shift points to a vital change in Marx’s thinking, argues Saito. “With his growing interest in ecology,” Saito writes, “Marx came to see the plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central contradiction of capitalism.” By synthesising these different approaches, Saito developed a “unique way of reading Marx”, he says, as a “degrowth ecological communist”. Degrowth argues that economic growth – the holy grail for governments in most countries – is simply not sustainable and that to stop climate breakdown, we need to reduce consumption. Saito cites Jason Hickel’s work as one example. He is conscious of the critique that denying many countries in the global south the chance to “develop” in the way the north has could be destructive to people who are already very poor. Woven throughout Marx in the Anthropocene is a mindfulness of this global imbalance. “Like many degrowth people I limit the scope of the argument to the global north, developed countries like the UK, Japan and the US. I am obviously pro-growth for those poor countries in the global south.” What is needed to achieve that is a new idea of “abundance” and “progress”, Saito says. Everyone on the planet should have access to the basic things we need to live – electricity, water, education – but “we need to come up with a vision where mass production, mass consumption and mass waste can be avoided.” Crucial to imagining this alternative world is another strand of thinking in Marx’s notebooks: his interest in pre-capitalist, non-western societies. Contra to the ethnocentrism in some of his earlier work, in the end, Marx emphasised “the importance of learning” from these parts of the world “for the western societies”. Informed by this and his ecological studies, Marx’s idea of communism changed significantly, and was no longer growth-driven. “The pre-capitalist society had a unique way of communal regulations of land,” Saito says, “and they also imposed various rules on their production and consumption which realised a more steady-state of sustainable production.” Still, you may wonder why such a deep engagement with a 19th-century thinker matters today. Saito argues that Marx’s way of understanding the relationship between humans and nature – encapsulated in the theory of “metabolic rift”, a vigorously debated subject in Marxist circles – can determine how we respond to the climate and ecological crisis we now face. The basic premise of this thesis is that human/nature interaction is the “basis of living”, but capitalism organises “human interactions with their ecosystems” in such a way that it creates “a great chasm in these processes and threatens both human and nonhuman beings”, Saito says. Some criticise this concept, arguing that it divides nature and society so as to ignore how the former is completely transformed by capitalism. But Saito doesn’t agree. His use of the term Anthropocene is meant to recognise that the “entire planet is now fully transformed by our economic activities”, but he rejects that this means we don not have to distinguish between nature and society. If we understand the two as the same, Saito argues, we risk believing environmental problems can be overcome through more human intervention. We must be attuned to the differences to grasp what “we cannot change” – such as temperature increases due to CO2 and the natural chain reactions that flow from that – and what we can: most urgently “the fossil fuel industry”, Saito says. This makes him sceptical of technological utopianism. Though he had once been optimistic about the possibility of technological progress, he now sees the limitations. “By hoping there will be new technologies, we simply wait until they will be invented but the result will be they will never be and we will be all dead,” Saito says. This is not just a criticism of much-lauded technological fixes within capitalism, such as carbon capture and storage, but of the idea that we can transfer capitalist technologies to an automated communist utopia – where collectively owned robots do the vast majority of the work and there is no more resource scarcity thanks to green energy and things like asteroid mining. Saito welcomes these attempts for imagining a post-capitalist world but sees them as ultimately misguided. “This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of people’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of living in the global north,” he observes. “Such a vision accepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.” Capitalism doesn’t just flout natural scarcity, caring little for the planet’s limits, Saito argues – it artificially creates a social scarcity, where we are always compelled to want more: the latest phone, car or jacket. But we can reorganise our relationship with nature, Saito insists, to imagine a new kind of abundance: regulating advertising, SUV usage and constant mobile phone model changes while “distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members of the society”. Some sectors – those that don’t make a profit and so are underdeveloped in capitalism – would be improved, which would mean more money and resources for “education, care work, art, sports and public transportation”. Saito maintains this is not a miserabilist alternative future. Pointing to Kate Soper’s thinking, he says that the constant need to engage in competitive work and consumption is not a mark of the good life and in fact limits opportunities for fulfilling experiences outside the market. Without the need to produce for excessive, unnecessary consumption (that which is “necessary” for economic growth, not the development of the individual), jobs could be fundamentally changed. We could spend far fewer hours working, using our abilities and talents to do what we can and sharing the unpleasant and boring tasks more fairly. Saito, though, does not see this as a romanticised “return-to the countryside”, abandoning all technologies in the process; nor is he a Soviet Marxist. Using André Gorz’s distinction between “open” and “locking technology”, he advocates for the former. While the latter is “about domination over people and nature”, where “technology is for discipline and monopoly” – he gives nuclear power plants as an example – open technologies can be run at a local level by cooperatives. Solar panels, for instance, are a more democratic way of “controlling energy and electricity”, he says. This doesn’t amount to doing away with the state entirely, but he stresses: “My vision is not Soviet-style – I am not arguing for the state ownership of everything or state-planned economy.” That would simply change too little. One question, though, is how possible any of this actually is. Saito is aware of the challenges, but he points to Gen Z, Just Stop Oil, climate protests around the world, and Alberto Garzón, the Spanish minister for consumer affairs, who recently wrote about the limits of growth. This is a big change compared with the past 30 years, when such movements have been marginalised. “I am hoping the 2020s and 2030s will become much more turbulent as the crisis deepens,” he says, and hopes that the amount of radical protest will grow and changes in our values will continue to accelerate. “What I am trying to do,” Saito says at the end of our conversation, “is, inspired by these movements, offer something for them … I tried to show why it is necessary to criticise capitalism and why socialism or communism can be a more solid foundation for their movements too.” Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism is published by Cambridge University Press on 28 February",

                    "bodyText": "Labour’s ambitious plan for zero-carbon power by 2030 raises legitimate questions – which we’ll come to shortly – but the commentary in rightwing newspapers is bizarrely wide of the mark. Perhaps the strangest was a Daily Telegraph editorial that claimed Labour’s plan “would make the country more dependent on imported gas, not less”. As should be obvious, the opposite is true. The UK used 254 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas last year to generate 123TWh of electricity, 40% of the national total. Under Labour’s plan, gas demand for electricity would be 97% lower by 2030. (Why does it take 254TWh of gas to make 123TWh of electricity? Simply because burning fossil fuels is inefficient and half of the energy in the gas is wasted at the power station.) The UK’s low-carbon electricity sources are already saving huge amounts of gas: In 2022 to date, nuclear and renewables have generated 129TWh, more than the 95TWh we got from gas. The Daily Telegraph editorial echoed comments made by the likes of Darren Grimes and Julia Hartley-Brewer, who complained that we “can’t rely on solar or wind to keep our lights on”. Similarly, while interviewing the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg asked if fossil fuels would still be needed as backup in 2030, pointing to low wind output last Friday. Elsewhere, the Daily Mail said Starmer had been “forced to backtrack” by “admit[ting]” fossil fuels might still be used as backup under his 2030 plan. This was not so much an admission as a reiteration: Labour’s own press release had said it would “maintain … a strategic reserve of backup gas power”, as well as a range of other sources. Indeed, Labour’s plan does not rely on wind and solar alone. The hour-by-hour electricity system modelling behind Labour’s plans shows what would fill the gaps when the wind does not blow. In line with the clear consensus that cheap renewables will make up the bulk of electricity supplies in the future, Labour sees wind and solar making up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030. Almost all of the remaining 30% of the nation’s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including additional new nuclear plants, other renewables and hydrogen. The modelling then leaves a very small share – about 0.7% of annual electricity in 2030 – coming from gas power. A further 0.5% would come from gas plants fitted with carbon capture equipment that prevents their carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere. It’s clear that it would be possible to run a reliable UK electricity system on virtually 100% clean power, even during so-called “kalte dunkelflaute” with cold weather and little wind or sun. It’s also worth noting that Labour is not alone in imagining a fully decarbonised UK electricity system will soon be possible. The current government ambition, which is also backed by detailed modelling, is for 95% clean power by 2030 and close to 100% by 2035. Similarly, the National Grid Electricity System Operator has set out a range of “credible ways” to meet the UK’s net zero 2050 target, including one which reaches 98% clean power by 2030. Nevertheless, there are legitimate questions about the pace of Labour’s ambition, which would imply going from the current level of about 55% clean power to 99% in less than a decade. This rate of change would be historically unprecedented, at the same time as electricity demand increases to meet growing demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps. Until the 1960s, fossil fuels supplied more than 95% of the UK’s electricity. The development of nuclear power pushed the low-carbon share of electricity towards 25% by the late 1980s, where it remained into the early part of this century. More recently, the rapid growth of wind, solar and other renewables has seen the UK transform its electricity supply in a decade. Yet despite clean sources growing their share of UK electricity by 2.9 percentage points every year since 2010, fossil fuels still make up 45% of the total. Reaching Labour’s ambition for 99% by 2030 would mean increasing the rate of growth from 2.9 percentage points a year up to 4.9, starting this year. If this sprint only begins after the next election in 2024, the pace would need to be faster, at more than 7 percentage points a year. These are not only mathematical challenges – and it is not only a matter of doubling onshore wind, tripling solar and quadrupling offshore wind, as Starmer has pledged. (Meeting these renewable targets is likely to require planning reform to speed up the process of approvals.) If Labour’s goal is to be met, the UK must also build new nuclear plants, gas plants with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen turbines with clean hydrogen to fuel them, along with huge increases in electricity network capacity, energy storage and “demand-side response”. While the UK need not follow the precise pathway set out in the modelling behind Labour’s proposals, it would need an equivalent set of alternatives to reach close to 100% clean power. And even if Labour’s 2030 target proves too ambitious to meet, the government’s goal of a fully decarbonised electricity system by 2035 is not exactly far behind. Regardless of these question marks, one thing is for sure – whatever the editorial pages of the Daily Telegraph suggests: Whether the UK reaches 100% clean power by 2030 or 2035, the shift towards wind, solar and other low-carbon sources is 100% guaranteed to cut our demand for gas.",

Japan has requested help from the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the discharge meets global safety standards, including treating the wastewater so its radioactivity levels are below legal limits. Tepco’s Advanced Liquid Processing System reduces radioactive substances in the water to safe levels, but the system is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Experts say tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is only harmful to humans in very large doses, while government and Tepco officials have pointed out that working nuclear plants routinely dilute and release tritium into the ocean. Kishida, who supports the restart of nuclear reactors that were idled after the Fukushima meltdown, offered flowers and prayed at a monument to the disaster in Namie, one of several communities near the plant that were declared no-go zones after the disaster. Some residents have since returned to their homes after evacuation orders were lifted. Kishida has said that nuclear power must be part of Japan’s energy mix if it is to become carbon neutral by 2050. But he has yet to confirm if he will attend the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow early next month, with Japanese media reports suggesting he won’t decide until after lower house elections are held at the end of this month. Boris Johnson encouraged Kishida to attend the summit during a phone call last week, adding that Britain was considering lifting import restrictions on Fukushima produce that were introduced while it was a member of the European Union, according to the Kyodo news agency.",

Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Denmark’s military has issued an image of gas bubbling at the surface of the Baltic Sea after “unprecedented” damage to the Nord Stream pipelines, which has seen three offshore lines of the system damaged in one day. Seismologists in Sweden say on Monday they detected what they described as two explosions in the regions of the Baltic sea where the leaks have occurred. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has already called the leaks “an act of sabotage” which he said “related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.” The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called Russia’s mobilisation “a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of “cannon fodder”,” in the Ukrainian president’s nightly address on Monday evening. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said it had made no decision on closing Russia’s borders as the first mobilisation since the second world war prompted some to flee. Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men avoid military call-up The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved.

Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany’s population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office said, with more than 84 million people now living in the European Union’s most populous country.

                    "body": "<p>The head of the EU executive, has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic.</p> \n<p>Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a cap on their revenues, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills.</p> \n<p>Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income.</p> \n<p>“These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies.</p> \n<p>Oil and gas companies that have made “massive profits” would also be subject to a windfall tax, which Von der Leyen called a “solidarity contribution”.</p> \n<p>While she did not mention specific numbers, a leaked document seen by the Guardian shows the commission wants a €200 (£173) per megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by low-carbon technologies. The paper states this “mimics the market outcomes that could be expected were global supply chains functioning normally and not subject to the weaponisation of energy through gas supply disruptions”.</p> \n<p>The leaked document also reveals that the EU executive wants a mandatory 5% reduction in electricity use in peak hours. This echoes an earlier plan for gas savings, although EU member states decided those efficiency measures should be voluntary, raising questions about whether they will accept a mandatory target.</p> \n<p>Finally, Von der Leyen proposed a cap on the price of Russian gas, saying it was necessary to cut revenues that “Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine”.</p> \n<p>The EU has spent nearly €88bn on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a tracker from the NGO Europe Beyond Coal.</p> \n<p>The plan to cap Russian gas ran into immediate opposition from the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who is due to chair an EU crisis meeting on Friday. “It’s not a constructive proposal,” he told the Czech senate, adding that it looked like further “sanctions against Russia [rather] than an actual solution to the energy crisis in Europe”.</p> \n<p>Criticising the plan from a different angle, Poland argues the bloc should cap the price of all non-EU gas as it fears that targeting Russia will trigger retaliation that will deprive Ukraine of lucrative pipeline transit fees. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d49713f-95e7-4113-a0d7-ea8c7bb69277\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rJngREUNLR8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin dismissed attempts to cap the prices of oil and gas as “completely stupid” and “sheer nonsense”, while claiming that Russia had enough customers in Asia to ride out the damage. “Will they make political decisions contradicting contracts?” he said. “In that case, we won’t supply anything if it goes against our economic interests. We don’t supply anything: no gas, no oil, no coal, no heating oil, nothing.”</p> \n<p>Asked about his comments, Von der Leyen said Russia had already partially or completely cut off gas to 13 EU member states. “We don’t give anything any more on these announcements by Russia, because we know they’re blackmailing us. The best thing is to fortify ourselves and go towards other suppliers. And have solidarity.”</p> \n<p>The Kremlin-controlled state energy company Gazprom announced last Friday it would not be restarting gas flows through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline connecting Russia and Europe. While Gazprom blamed “malfunctions” in a turbine along the pipeline, the Kremlin later said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/05/russia-will-not-resume-gas-supplies-to-europe-until-sanctions-lifted-says-moscow\">would not resume full gas supplies until Europe lifted sanctions</a> imposed in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before the recent shutdown, gas deliveries from Russia to the EU had fallen to 30% of the 2016-21 average.</p> \n<p>Even before the war, Europe was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/energy-crisis-eu-ministers-debate-reliance-gas-russia\">already facing spiralling gas prices</a> as Chinese demand for fuel surged in the economic rebound after the pandemic. Problems have been compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/china-reports-most-severe-heatwave-and-lowest-rainfall-on-record\">record-breaking hot dry summer</a> that has pushed up demand for air-conditioning, while reducing hydropower from rivers and reservoirs. Meanwhile half of France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors have been forced offline because of corrosion problems in key pipes and safety checks, reversing the country’s traditional role as exporter of electricity to its neighbours.</p> \n<p>Von der Leyen said the EU was seeing the effects of climate change and drought and described renewables as “our energy insurance for the future”.</p> \n<p>The long-awaited plans will be discussed by EU energy ministers in emergency talks on Friday. Von der Leyen – who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/eu-must-act-now-on-catastrophic-energy-price-spike-says-european-council-chief\">accused of a slow response</a> to the energy price surge – is due to discuss the plans with the bloc’s ambassadors on Wednesday, before further diplomatic talks.</p>",

Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a cap on their revenues, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Oil and gas companies that have made “massive profits” would also be subject to a windfall tax, which Von der Leyen called a “solidarity contribution”. While she did not mention specific numbers, a leaked document seen by the Guardian shows the commission wants a €200 (£173) per megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by low-carbon technologies. The paper states this “mimics the market outcomes that could be expected were global supply chains functioning normally and not subject to the weaponisation of energy through gas supply disruptions”. The leaked document also reveals that the EU executive wants a mandatory 5% reduction in electricity use in peak hours. This echoes an earlier plan for gas savings, although EU member states decided those efficiency measures should be voluntary, raising questions about whether they will accept a mandatory target. Finally, Von der Leyen proposed a cap on the price of Russian gas, saying it was necessary to cut revenues that “Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine”. The EU has spent nearly €88bn on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a tracker from the NGO Europe Beyond Coal. The plan to cap Russian gas ran into immediate opposition from the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who is due to chair an EU crisis meeting on Friday. “It’s not a constructive proposal,” he told the Czech senate, adding that it looked like further “sanctions against Russia [rather] than an actual solution to the energy crisis in Europe”. Criticising the plan from a different angle, Poland argues the bloc should cap the price of all non-EU gas as it fears that targeting Russia will trigger retaliation that will deprive Ukraine of lucrative pipeline transit fees. Speaking in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin dismissed attempts to cap the prices of oil and gas as “completely stupid” and “sheer nonsense”, while claiming that Russia had enough customers in Asia to ride out the damage. “Will they make political decisions contradicting contracts?” he said. “In that case, we won’t supply anything if it goes against our economic interests. We don’t supply anything: no gas, no oil, no coal, no heating oil, nothing.” Asked about his comments, Von der Leyen said Russia had already partially or completely cut off gas to 13 EU member states. “We don’t give anything any more on these announcements by Russia, because we know they’re blackmailing us. The best thing is to fortify ourselves and go towards other suppliers. And have solidarity.” The Kremlin-controlled state energy company Gazprom announced last Friday it would not be restarting gas flows through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline connecting Russia and Europe. While Gazprom blamed “malfunctions” in a turbine along the pipeline, the Kremlin later said it would not resume full gas supplies until Europe lifted sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before the recent shutdown, gas deliveries from Russia to the EU had fallen to 30% of the 2016-21 average. Even before the war, Europe was already facing spiralling gas prices as Chinese demand for fuel surged in the economic rebound after the pandemic. Problems have been compounded by the record-breaking hot dry summer that has pushed up demand for air-conditioning, while reducing hydropower from rivers and reservoirs. Meanwhile half of France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors have been forced offline because of corrosion problems in key pipes and safety checks, reversing the country’s traditional role as exporter of electricity to its neighbours. Von der Leyen said the EU was seeing the effects of climate change and drought and described renewables as “our energy insurance for the future”. The long-awaited plans will be discussed by EU energy ministers in emergency talks on Friday. Von der Leyen – who has been accused of a slow response to the energy price surge – is due to discuss the plans with the bloc’s ambassadors on Wednesday, before further diplomatic talks.",
