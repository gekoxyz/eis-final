Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-gorbachev\">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> is here, pale in a spotlit coffin: the last Soviet leader finally being laid to rest.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin is not here, a snub that the Kremlin has said was a result of his busy work schedule. Yet thousands of Russians have come to pay their respects, lining up past the downtown theatres and trendy cafes, each person a reminder that Mikhail Gorbachev still remains a hero to some.</p> <p>“He did a lot, but people now in our country hate him,” Vladimir Gubarev, a retired journalist who lined up on Saturday morning bearing a few carnations, told the <em>Observer</em>. “People want to be happy fast. Immediately. The way of Gorbachev was the slow way to freedom, to real freedom. And he didn’t have enough time.”</p> <p>For many, coming to the hall was both an act of appreciation and one of defiance to honour the memory of a leader who brought new freedoms and hastened the collapse of his own country. “He was a great man, so immediately after his death, people say good words about him,” said Gubarev. “But only after he is gone. Because while he was alive, he was dangerous.

Previously, there had been reports that it had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. The EU expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after G7 finance ministers said that they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine and accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said in a BBC interview that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. Russians paid their final respects to the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects. Sweden said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch, Agence France-Presse reports. The prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, warned that Sweden was facing the prospect of a “war winter”. Andersson said at a press conference in Stockholm that the guarantees were aimed at giving energy groups “the breathing room that is needed” and that there was “a clear security policy agenda behind Russia’s actions”. The exact details of the guarantees, she said, have yet to be worked out. Andersson added: Russia’s energy war is having serious consequences for Europe and Swedish households and companies, especially in southern Sweden which is dependent on electricity prices in Germany, which in turn is very dependent on gas. This threatens our financial stability. If we don’t act soon it could lead to serious disruptions in the Nordics and Baltics. In the worst-case scenario we could fall into a financial crisis.” Finance minister Mikael Damberg said the Swedish decision would “secure financial stability not only in Sweden but in the entire Nordic region”. The guarantees were expected to be in place on Monday and would cover the Nordic and Baltic regions within the next two weeks. Sweden’s parliament has been called in from its summer break to hold a vote on the government’s proposal on Monday. The global atomic energy watchdog has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is now relying on a reserve line. Agence France-Presse reports: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but the facility is continuing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site today,” the agency said in a statement. Less than 48 hours after Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Thursday established the presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to ZaporizhzhIa (ISAMZ) at the facility in southern Ukraine, the Agency’s experts were told by senior Ukrainian staff that the ZNPP’s fourth operational 750 Kilovolt (kV) power line was down. The three others were lost earlier during the conflict.” Here is a report from my colleague Andrew Roth: The Pillar Hall in the House of the Unions is a grand old ballroom where Soviet leaders are put on display when they die. Nearly a century ago, the body of Vladimir Lenin lay in state for three days before his funeral. Stalin and Brezhnev followed. Now Mikhail Gorbachev is here, pale in a spotlit coffin: the last Soviet leader finally being laid to rest. Vladimir Putin is not here, a snub that the Kremlin has said was a result of his busy work schedule. Yet thousands of Russians have come to pay their respects, lining up past the downtown theatres and trendy cafes, each person a reminder that Mikhail Gorbachev still remains a hero to some. “He did a lot, but people now in our country hate him,” Vladimir Gubarev, a retired journalist who lined up on Saturday morning bearing a few carnations, told the Observer. “People want to be happy fast. Immediately. The way of Gorbachev was the slow way to freedom, to real freedom. And he didn’t have enough time.” For many, coming to the hall was both an act of appreciation and one of defiance to honour the memory of a leader who brought new freedoms and hastened the collapse of his own country. “He was a great man, so immediately after his death, people say good words about him,” said Gubarev. “But only after he is gone. Because while he was alive, he was dangerous. He was the enemy.” You can read the full report here. Gorbachev’s funeral took place without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Reuters reports that the man “affectionately known as ‘Gorby’ in the West and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his role in ending the Cold War” was buried at Moscow’s famous Novodevichy cemetery alongside his wife Raisa, who died in 1999. Best known in the West for helping end the Cold War, reducing his country’s nuclear stockpile, and for unwittingly presiding over the demise of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev’s legacy still divides opinion inside and outside Russia. But those who lined up to say farewell recalled the late politician, who died in Moscow after an unspecified illness, with gratitude. He was a peacemaker, he was one of God’s sons,” said Tatiana, 80, who said she had come despite poor health. Tycoon and close friend Alexander Lebedev said: “He wanted to give us democracy and freedom and we turned out to not be very ready yet. “That’s most unfortunate but we will still be a European country. This part of history will be over one day.” Here are some images from the funeral today of the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who died on Tuesday aged 91. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. The EU expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Gentiloni was speaking after Russia scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume flows of an important gas supply route to Germany, deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing winter fuel. Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart came after the decision by G7 finance ministers that they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. The Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine was once again knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday, local Russian-backed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Kremlin-appointed regional administration, claimed sustained shelling destroyed a key power line and penetrated deep into the plant’s premises. His claims could not be immediately verified. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they also discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Russian forces also struck two enterprises in Sloviansk, damaging several houses, Kyrylenko added. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly said he believed the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support of Ukraine. Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC due to be broadcast on Sunday, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. Russians paid their final respects to the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent. Several thousand mourners queued up to quietly file past Gorbachev’s open casket that was flanked by honour guards under the Russian flag in the historic Hall of Columns. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, travelled to Moscow to pay his respects. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, has reportedly said he plans to take an “indefinite and long” break from his post. Kadyrov, who has ruled Russia’s Chechnya republic with an iron fist since 2007, was in March promoted to lieutenant-general by Vladimir Putin for his role in the invasion of Ukraine. In a video posted to his Telegram, Kadyrov, 45, reportedly says he believes the “time has come” for him to leave. Kadyrov said: I realised that I have been sitting in my position for a long time. I think my time has come [to leave power]. The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford shared the video, writing: Is Kadyrov resigning or is this some weird Kadyrovism? Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has said that while the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, Britons “count pennies” while Ukrainians “count casualties”. In an interview with the BBC, Zelenska said if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. The wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy was asked what message she had for people in the UK who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenska said: I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it’s still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties. During the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow, she said it was difficult for people outside Ukraine to understand the impact of the war on its people. It was, therefore, important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war, she said. She added: That’s why we have to tell these stories, to show these stories, because these are the faces of a war. Not a number of bombs dropped, not the amount of money spent, human stories - and there are a thousand stories like that around. An eight-year-old child has died after Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv this morning, according to the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeyeva. Two other children were among those injured in Russian shelling in the city of Mykolaiv and Bereznehuvate, she said in an update on Telegram. Zamazeyeva said: Today’s morning was especially difficult. Shelling continues. Unfortunately, there are victims. There are two wounded in the city of Mykolaiv, four in Bereznehuvate. Among those injured are two children. Unfortunately, an 8-year-old child [was killed]. She added: In addition to artillery shelling, air strikes on populated areas in the Pervomaiske, Shyroke and Bereznehuvate communities were recorded. Residential buildings and outbuildings were damaged. Fires broke out as a result of shelling. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he has spoken with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, following a long-awaited visit by UN nuclear inspectors to the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine. Michel paid tribute to the UN nuclear agency’s “courage and professionalism”, describing the 14-strong team’s mission to the Russian-occupied nuclear plant as “impressive”. The EU “fully supports” the IAEA’s work and efforts, he added. the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the west of playing a “chess game with death” in its support for Ukraine. In a post on Vkontake, Russia’s largest social network, Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, accused western countries of trying to take advantage of the conflict to push Russia to “a new round of disintegration”. “To do everything so that the state institutions of Russia stop working,” he said. “To deprive the country of effective governance, as it was back in 1991. And, as a result, eliminate Russia from the political field.” He added that the “such attempts are really extremely dangerous” because they “ignore a simple axiom: the violent disintegration of a nuclear power is always a chess game with death”. He also described Russia’s nuclear arsenal as “the best guarantee of the preservation of Great Russia”. At least one woman has been injured in a strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleksandr Senkevych said explosions were heard in the city at around 11:30am local time and that a garage had been struck. He said rescuers were working to extinguish a fire at the site and that the shockwave had also blown out the windows and doors of a nearby private residential building. One woman received shrapnel injuries, he said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, according to his office. The pair spoke in a phone call where they discussed developments regarding Ukrainian grain exports, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. They also expressed their determination to continue the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey according to plans. They agreed to discuss the issues in detail when they meet in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, for a summit later this month, the office added. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has travelled to Moscow to pay his respects at the funeral of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. There were no plans for Orbán to meet with Vladimir Putin during his trip to Moscow, Russian media reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Peskov told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti: As far as we know, he will only fly in to say goodbye to Gorbachev. There were no desires for meetings. Vladimir Putin is waging economic and psychological war by closing a major gas pipeline to Europe, a former energy industry boss has said. The decision by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom to extend the shutdown of gas flows through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline has left Britain “panicking”, according to Angela Knight, former chief executive of trade association Energy UK. Speaking to Times Radio today, Knight said the UK and Europe had become energy dependent on countries that were “not all that friendly”. She said: He’s (Putin) actually playing the economic war extremely well. He’s playing the psychological war extremely well. We have been panicking as a country - Europe has been panicking as well - and it’s not surprising and I’m not critical of it. Britain’s energy policy has been “wrong for a long, long time”, she added. “It’s a really nasty shock that we’ve had.” The European commissioner for the economy, Paolo Gentiloni, said the EU expects Russia to respect energy contracts it has agreed but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so. Asked about the halt to the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, Gentiloni pointed to high gas storage levels and said there were plans to conserve energy in the winter. He said: We expect Russia to respect the contracts that they have. But even if weaponisation of energy continues or increases, the EU is ready to react. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key Ukrainian presidential adviser, has said Kyiv will determine the end of the war when it has finished “liberating its territories” and demanding Russia pay reparations. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: [Russian Federation] officials repeat weird mantra: “Special military operation will be completed on time”, “The West delays its completion”. It looks like they did not understand anything. Ukraine will determine the ending war term by liberating its territories. As well as reparations payments amount. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this week extended his “special military operation” and reportedly ordered his troops to capture the Donetsk region by 15 September, rather than the original 31 August deadline. The Russian energy major Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for them to carry out the work. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, citing “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented, without providing a timeframe for a reopening. In a statement today, Gazprom said Siemens Energy was taking part in repair work in accordance with an existing contract between the two companies and was ready to fix faults which Gazprom said had forced it to halt gas supply to Germany through the pipeline. Russian troops launched overnight rocket attacks on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko. In an update posted to his Telegram account, Kyrylenko said: In Kramatorsk, a rocket hit a food enterprise, injuring a person. Another one hit a light industry enterprise. A fire broke out there. Russian forces also struck two enterprises in Sloviansk, damaging several houses, Kyrylenko added. Vadym Liakh, the mayor of Sloviansk, confirmed the city was under attack, writing on Facebook: The city was shelled again. There were loud explosions on the outskirts. In Bylbasivka, private houses were damaged on Shkilna and Yaseneva Streets. My colleague Andrew Roth is covering the farewell ceremony of Mikhail Gorbachev, which is being held in the Hall of Pillars in Moscow’s House of the Unions today. The funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, will take place today without state honours or the presence of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Mourners began queuing up near the Kremlin this morning to pay their last respects to Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91. Gorbachev is the first Russian leader since Nikita Khrushchev not to receive an official state funeral in what has been widely seen as a snub by the Russian president. He was, however, granted a public send-off, with authorities allowing Russians to view his coffin in the Hall of Columns, where previous Soviet leaders have been mourned. The farewell ceremony will be followed by a closed funeral in the Novodevichy cemetery. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said schedule constraints meant Putin would not attend a public farewell ceremony at Moscow’s House of Unions, or the funeral at Novodevichy cemetery today. Putin did pay his respects to the Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers by Gorbachev’s coffin at the mourning hall of Moscow’s Central Clinical hospital. Russia has expressed “alarm” to the UN’s secretary general that the US has yet to issue visas for its delegation to attend a session of the general assembly later this month, according to a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. “None of the 56 Russian representatives from the main team and advance group have received entry visas to the United States” as of Thursday, Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia wrote in a letter addressed to the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres. Nebenzia added that a “similar situation exists with the accompanying journalists and crew members” on the flight of the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov is set to lead Russia’s delegation to the UN general assembly from 20-26 September. Nebenzia added: This is even more alarming since for the last several months the authorities of the United States have been constantly refusing to grant entry visas to a number of Russian delegates assigned to take part in the official United Nations events. Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for an indefinite period is set to worsen Europe’s energy crisis. The Russian-owned gas giant Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline, which was due to reopen on Saturday, would remain shut until a turbine was repaired. Gazprom indicated it had discovered “oil leaks” in a turbine while carrying out maintenance with representatives of Siemens, which manufactured the turbine, and published a picture on Telegram of cables covered in a brown liquid. Earlier, the Kremlin warned the future operation of the Nord Stream pipeline – the biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe – was at risk due to a lack of spare parts. The turbine-maker Siemens Energy said in a statement that the oil leaks blamed by Gazprom was “not a technical reason for stopping operation”, adding that it was “not contracted for maintenance work. Such leakages do not usually affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. Following the imposition of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has reduced or halted gas supplies to different European nations, causing energy prices to soar. The Kremlin has blamed the sanctions for the reduced supplies. As winter approaches, European nations have been seeking to completely fill their gas reserves, secure alternative supplies and put into place plans to reduce consumption. The Russian energy major Gazprom extended the shutdown of gas flows through its key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Friday evening, providing no timeframe for a reopening. The move came hours after G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to stem the flow of funds to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Gazprom, the state-owned oil and gas firm, said supplies would remain halted indefinitely after a leak was detected. It said the pipeline would not restart until repairs were fully implemented. Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe and has the capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. Continued supplies through the pipeline are seen as crucial to prevent a deepening of the energy crisis. In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom said: Gas transportation to the Nord Stream gas pipeline has been completely halted until the complaints on the operation of the equipment have been eliminated. It said in the social media post it had identified “malfunctions” on a key turbine along the pipeline, which carries natural gas from western Russia to Germany, and that the pipeline would not work unless these were eliminated. Early on Wednesday, Gazprom completely halted the flow of gas through Nord Stream 1, in line with an earlier announcement, adding that the stoppage would last for three days. Flows were due to resume just after midnight on Saturday morning. Read the full article by Alex Lawson here. Ukrainian forces have “likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise” with the ongoing counter-offensive, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, it said it had done so by taking advantage of “poor logistics, administration and leadership” in Russia’s military. It said: Since 29 August 2022, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been conducting renewed offensive operations in the south of Ukraine. One element of this offensive is an ongoing advance on a broad front west of the Dnipro River, focusing on three axes within Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast. The operation has limited immediate objectives, but Ukraine’s forces have likely achieved a degree of tactical surprise; exploiting poor logistics, administration and leadership in the Russian armed forces. With fighting also continuing in the Donbas and Kharkiv sectors, a key decision for Russian commanders in coming days will be where to commit any operational reserve force they can generate. Ukraine’s military said it had carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar on Friday, near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant where UN experts are working. Reuters reports that the revelation by the armed forces’ general staff was unusual because the military rarely gives details of specific targets. The staff said in a Facebook post: It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers. It did not give more details about the strikes. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhoda, which is about 300km (185 miles) from Kherson. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear plant, while Kyiv says pro-Moscow forces are responsible for attacking it. The Russian energy company Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing turbine damage. Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, indicated Siemens could not carry out repairs because of sanctions. The European Commission chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said Gazprom was staging the shutdown “under fallacious pretences”. The shutdown of the single biggest pipeline for gas from Russia to Europe will stoke concerns over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said six of the team’s experts remained at the site to continue the work. He told reporters the mission would produce a report early next week of its findings. Grossi said military operations were increasing in the region of the plant, “which worries me a lot”. He said the military presence was not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit to the Russian-controlled facility in south-eastern Ukraine . Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin said imposing the price cap would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders went ahead it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” would likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been “violated several times”, Rafael Grossi said. The IAEA chief said after leading the inspection team that while he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion. “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country,” Pushilin said. “This is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. That’s a rundown of the latest developments as it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv.",

But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019.<br>Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighbouring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food </em><em>Programme says 22 million people are hungry.</em></p> \n   <p><em>“I think there’s a high probability we’ll have a declaration of famine” in the coming weeks, Beasley said.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But the slow reopening of Ukraine’s ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won’t solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said.

As it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments on this Saturday 20 August 2022.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has agreed to inspectors visiting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. </strong>According to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Russian leader had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> to the site, after Putin himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. The office said Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN secretary general has asked Russia not take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. </strong>António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied facility not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow was planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Western officials say there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at the Zaporizhzhia plant.</strong> Its existing reactor cooling system is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation, but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from Ukraine’s grid.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out</strong>, according to a western official in Ukraine.<strong> </strong>The Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea, western officials have said. However, overall “combat stasis” remains.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine,</strong> including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The US has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest.</strong> Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google – that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles ($34,000) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles for violating military censorship laws.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv, </strong>Ukraine’s second-largest city. It is the latest in a string of such appointments, which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. </strong>Hit by Russia’s 24 February invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p>The Kyiv Independent reported that <strong>rescuers are searching for people and bodies </strong>under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on Kharkiv.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November</strong>, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News.<strong> </strong>“Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he said. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.<strong><br></strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled cities since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</strong>, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian frontline, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T17:42:40.215Z\">at 6.42pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French president, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has said. Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. The US deputy treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, told Turkey’s deputy finance minister, Yunus Elitas, that Russian entities and individuals were attempting to use Turkey to bypass western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, the US treasury department said. In a phone call, the department said, the two also discussed efforts to implement and enforce sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, posted this uplifting tweet: Shortly before his two-day trip to Canada, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, received support for his interest in Canadian liquid natural gas to help replace Russian gas imports from an unexpected ally, Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz. Kyiv has been at loggerheads with Berlin over its deal with Moscow to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and more recently over its deal with Canada to get a repaired turbine for the Nord Stream 1 delivered back to Germany. But the prospect of LNG deliveries to Europe from Canada is something that Naftogaz has also been working on itself. Naftogaz’s CEO, Yuriy Vitrenko, told Reuters that Canadian gas had many advantages. “Canadian suppliers do not have dominance in the German market, do not abuse it, as Gazprom, who is artificially decreasing supplies, ‘cornering the market’, and ripping off its customers,” he said. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland said her country had proved itself a “reliable partner” under a UN-backed deal allowing grain exports, as a shipment arrived in the southern Irish port of Foynes. The vessel, the Panama-flagged Navi Star carrying 33,000 tonnes of grain, arrived in Ireland after leaving southern Ukraine’s main port of Odesa two weeks ago. The shipment was one of the first to leave the war-torn country under a landmark deal struck with Russia and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ireland, Larysa Gerasko, told AFP her country had proved itself a “reliable partner and reliable global grain exporter”. She said the continuation of shipments ultimately “depends on Russia, on Russian actions”, adding: “We expect Russia to keep to its commitments under the Black Sea grain initiative.” A message from António Guterres, the UN secretary general, on the World Food Programme effort. The destroyed Russian military vehicles have been on display in Kyiv ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday.

Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. Russia has claimed that Ukraine poisoned some of its servicemen in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia in late July. However, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said in response that the alleged poisoning could have been caused by Russian forces eating expired canned meat. This has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Reuters reports: The Russian defence ministry said a number of Russian servicemen had been taken to a military hospital with signs of serious poisoning on 31 July. Tests showed a toxic substance, botulinum toxin type B, in their bodies, it said. “On the fact of chemical terrorism sanctioned by the Zelenskiy regime, Russia is preparing supporting evidence with the results of all the analyses,” the ministry said in a statement. It did not say how many servicemen had suffered or what their condition was now. It did not say what the “supporting evidence” was. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has tweeted the following thread on the two-year anniversary of his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under a deal agreed last month. Speaking to a news conference in Istanbul, Guterres said: “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. “Getting more food and fertiliser out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers.” A Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town, wounding 12 civilians and heightening fears of a nuclear accident during the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said on the Telegram messaging app that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey apartment building in Voznesensk. Reuters reports: The town is about 30 km (19 miles) from the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), the second largest in Ukraine. State-run Energoatom, which manages all four Ukrainian nuclear energy generators, described the attack on Voznesensk as “another act of Russian nuclear terrorism”. “It is possible that this missile was aimed specifically at the Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant, which the Russian military tried to seize back at the beginning of March,” Energoatom said in a statement. The town of Enerhodar, where the Zaporizhzhia plant – Europe’s largest – is located, has come under repeated shelling, with Moscow and Kyiv trading blame for the attacks. Emma Graham-Harrison, senior international affairs correspondent at the Guardian, has tweeted this photo from Kyiv of a child posing on a tank. You can read the Guardian’s full report of Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s Black Seat Fleet headquarters here: Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came amid cautious optimism elsewhere as two more grain ships left a Ukrainian port. The shipments, from Chornomorsk port, brought the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. A £65m superyacht of a Russian oligarch hit by sanctions will be auctioned off by the Gibraltar government on Tuesday, becoming the first of the luxury vessels to be sold off since restrictions were imposed on hundreds of rich Russians after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the 72.5-metre Axioma is not being sold for the benefit of the Ukrainian people but for a US investment bank, JP Morgan, which claims the yacht’s billionaire owner, Dmitry Pumpyansky, owes it more than $20m (£17m). The vessel, which features six luxurious guest cabins, a swimming pool, a 3D cinema room, gym, jacuzzi and a fully equipped spa, was detained after docking in Gibraltar in March. Pumpyansky, the owner and chairman of the steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, was subjected to sanctions by the UK, EU and the US after the invasion of Ukraine. The UK said the billionaire, who it said had built up an estimated £1.84bn fortune, was one of the oligarchs “closest to Putin”. Robert Neate’s full report is below: Lloyd J. Austin III, US secretary of defense, has tweeted regarding the $775m support package the country is providing for Ukraine. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has praised the “moving” sight of Ukrainian wheat headed for eastern Africa as part of an operation by the World Food Programme. Ukraine is “trolling” Moscow with a parade of Russian military vehicles in Kyiv on Saturday, reports senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison: Multiple children have reportedly been injured following a Russian strike on a residential building in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine. One girl’s eye was torn out by shrapnel, according to Nexta, following the attack on the five-story building in Voskresenske. A BBC Ukraine journalist, who tweeted a picture of the damaged building, said four children aged three to 17 were seriously injured and five adults were injured: Olaf Scholz has praised Alexei Navalny on the second anniversary of the jailed Russian opposition politician’s attempted poisoning. The German chancellor also criticised Russia’s clampdown on freedom of speech. “The war that Russia started against Ukraine is a war that also has consequences for Russia,” Scholz said in a video message on Saturday. “Freedom and democracy were already endangered before. But now, freedom of expression is much more endangered and many fear to say their own opinion.” He said it was important to remember Navalny because he was fighting for his belief that “one lives in a democracy and state governed by the rule of law”. The US is planning to buy about 150,000 metric tonnes of grain from Ukraine in the next few weeks for an upcoming shipment of food aid from ports no longer blockaded by war, the World Food Programme chief has told the Associated Press. The Associated Press reports: The final destinations for the grain are not confirmed and discussions continue, David Beasley said. But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation. Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019. Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighbouring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food Programme says 22 million people are hungry. “I think there’s a high probability we’ll have a declaration of famine” in the coming weeks, Beasley said. The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict. Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February. But the slow reopening of Ukraine’s ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won’t solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said. He warned that richer countries must do much more to keep grain and other assistance flowing to the hungriest parts of the world, and he named names. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has posted its latest defence intelligence update. In case you missed it last night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave a video address to the nation, vowing that every Russian strike on the country would be answered. Zelenskyy said: All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide. You can listen and read a transcription of the full address here. Ukraine’s defence ministry say that in total they have killed 44,900 Russian personnel, an increase of 200 on the previous day. These figures have not been independently verified by the Guardian. There have been multiple reports of an explosion in Crimea on Saturday morning, with an unmanned aerial vehicle striking the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol. IZ.RU reports on Telegram that, according to the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, a drone flew into the roof of the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet, before being shot down over naval headquarters. He posted a picture online, saying nobody was hurt. Razvozhaey added that no one was hurt. Ukraine has not commented on the reported attacks. The Guardian has not independently verified this report. Here is a roundup of what we know as of yesterday regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Turkey has said that two more ships carrying grain have left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, bringing the total number of vessels to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea ports under a UN-brokered grain export deal to 27. Reuters reports: The Zumrut Ana and MV Ocean S, which are authorized to depart on Aug. 20, were loaded with 6,300 tonnes of sunflower oil and 25,000 tonnes of wheat respectively, the joint coordination centre set up to enable safe passage said in a statement. Ukraine’s Sea Ports Authority said on Saturday three Ukrainian seaports had begun loading food onto seven ships, which would deliver 66,500 tonnes of wheat, corn and sunflower oil to consumers. Ukraine’s grain exports have slumped since the start of the war because its Black Sea ports – a vital route for shipments – were closed, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. At the end of July, three Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. In its daily intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says: The last week has seen only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline. In the Donbas, after small advances from early August, Russian forces have approached the outskirts of the town of Bakhmut, but have not yet broken into the built-up area. Russia has not made any major efforts to advance in the Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv sectors. In the south-west, neither Ukrainian nor Russian forces have made advances on the Kherson frontline. However, it adds the “increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south”. Russia has reported fresh Ukrainian drone attacks, a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and in Russia. The latest apparent displays of Kyiv’s growing ability to pummel Moscow’s assets far from frontlines occurred on Friday evening, Reuters reported, and followed huge blasts last week at an air base in Russian-annexed Crimea. In a new assessment, a western official said the earlier explosions had rendered half of Russia’s Black Sea naval aviation force useless. Russia’s RIA and Tass news agencies, citing a local official in Crimea, said it appeared Russian anti-aircraft forces had been in action near the western Crimean port of Yevpatoriya on Friday night. Video posted by a Russian website showed what appeared to be a ground-to-air missile hitting a target. Tass cited a local official as saying Russian anti-aircraft forces knocked down six Ukrainian drones sent to attack the town of Nova Kakhovka, east of the city of Kherson. Ukraine says retaking Kherson is one of its main priorities. Separately, an official in Crimea said defences there had downed an unspecified number of drones over the city of Sevastopol. Vladimir Putin’s agreement to allow independent inspectors to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the French presidency, comes as concerns grow over fighting near the Russian-occupied site. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, “welcomed recent statements indicating that both Ukraine and Russia supported the [International Atomic Energy Agency’s] aim to send a mission to” the plant, Agence France-Presse reported. The Kremlin said after Putin and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke by phone on Friday that the two leaders had agreed that the IAEA should carry out inspections as soon as possible to “assess the real situation on the ground”. A flare-up in fighting around the Russian-controlled nuclear power station – with both sides blaming each other for attacks – has raised the spectre of a disaster worse than in Chernobyl. The Kremlin said Putin stressed that shelling of the plant “creates the danger of a large-scale catastrophe”. The warning came a day after the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and sounded the alarm over the fighting. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged the UN to secure the site. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. As it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments on this Saturday 20 August 2022. Vladimir Putin has agreed to inspectors visiting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Russian leader had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after Putin himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. The office said Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied facility not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow was planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at the Zaporizhzhia plant. Its existing reactor cooling system is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation, but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from Ukraine’s grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. The Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea, western officials have said. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The US has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google – that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles ($34,000) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. It is the latest in a string of such appointments, which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s 24 February invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on Kharkiv. The Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he said. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled cities since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian frontline, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads.",

Speaking amid reports of a cabinet split over landmark energy security plans due to be published within days, Kwasi Kwarteng offered up a tax on oil companies, backed by Labour, as the one policy that definitely will not find favour with ministers. “We believe a windfall tax would be a tax on jobs, would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets,” he said. “It would be completely the wrong message to send investors.” Labour has said the pain inflicted on households by the soaring price of oil and gas could be eased by a tax on the companies that sell it. But Kwarteng has said such a move would penalise anyone with a pension invested in those companies. “It’s a retro measure which completely doesn’t understand what business is all about,” he said. Kwarteng, who was answering questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday, was repeatedly asked if the government had further plans to help households struggling to pay their energy bills. A cap on bills is due to rise by £693 to an average of £1,971 on 1 April, with prices predicted to soar as high as £3,000 at the next price cap increase in October. Kwarteng said “nobody knows” how high prices will go and pointed only to measures announced in chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, which has been derided for the limitations of its plan to help people cope with the cost-of-living crisis. While the business minister said oil firms would not be hit with a windfall tax, he did unveil a pledge to boost renewable energy sources. The government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK’s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia. Kwarteng put forward the targets as part of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK’s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. Ministers are also divided over plans to back onshore wind. BEIS’s targets include increasing solar power from its current capacity of 14GW to 50GW, offshore wind from 11GW to 50GW, onshore wind from 15GW to 30GW, and nuclear power from 7GW to 16GW, according to the Financial Times. Solar power and onshore wind generation have, to date, not had official government growth targets. Earlier this month, Kwarteng said developing the UK’s energy independence was a matter of national security. Boris Johnson has set out a 10-point plan that includes a target for the UK to get all of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035. The expansion of wind and solar farms is likely to be opposed by some residents and campaign groups. Johnson, who has said his personal preference is to expand offshore wind power generation, is considering plans to offer residents affected by the construction of energy farms or nuclear power plants financial incentives to win them over. On Tuesday, SSE, the electricity generator and network company, upgraded its profit forecasts after changes to weather conditions improved output from its renewable energy generation sources. The company – which raised adjusted earnings a share from guidance to between 92p and 97p, up from 90p – also said its thermal and hydro plant benefited from the disruption to oil and gas markets as a result of the war in Ukraine. “SSE’s integrated and balanced business model has performed well in turbulent market conditions,” said the SSE finance director, Gregor Alexander, who added that capital expenditure for the year to the end of March would exceed £2bn. “Our significant investment programme will make a huge contribution towards both net zero and energy security.”",

On Monday, the Russian military acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. The ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. They continued to “inflict massive fire damage” on Ukrainian forces, he claimed. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian military’s southern command said forces in the south destroyed 31 Russian tanks and one multiple rocket launcher, without providing details of where the fighting occurred. Russian sources acknowledged that the Ukrainian tank offensive had moved along the river’s west bank, recapturing a number of villages along the way, and threatening the supply lines for thousands of marooned Russian troops. Speaking overnight, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s 129th brigade from his home city of Kryvyi Rih had liberated the settlements of Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka in the northern Kherson region.

                    "bodyText": "The next generation of small nuclear reactors being advocated by the Coalition would raise electricity prices, slow the uptake of renewables and introduce new risks from nuclear waste, according to a report from the Australian Conservation Foundation. But the report from the conservation group has found only two small modular reactors (SMRs) are known to be operating around the world, in Russia and China, and both have seen large cost blowouts. Promoters of nuclear energy, the report claims, were pinning their hopes on technology that was “uncertain and unproven”. “The good news about the renewed nuclear discussion is that it highlights that business as usual with fossil fuels is not an option,” the report found. “The bad news is the very real risk of delay, distraction and a failure to advance a just energy transition”. Last week during question time, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, mocked the Coalition for supporting nuclear and asked which MP would be willing to have a reactor in their electorate. Nuclear energy has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s, but some Coalition senators are pushing for those restrictions to be lifted. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has tasked the shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, to review the status of nuclear energy. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the report Dave Sweeney, ACF’s Nuclear Free campaigner, wrote SMRs would push up electricity costs and introduce unnecessary challenges in managing nuclear waste. “In short, Australia’s energy future is renewable, not radioactive,” he wrote. According to the report, Russia’s floating nuclear plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, has two small SMR units on board. Construction costs had ballooned sixfold. Work started in 2012 on a demonstration plant in China with two gas-cooled reactors that was completed nine years later, costing $8.8bn. “The global SMR reality simply does not come close to matching the Australian SMR rhetoric,” the report says. Three further SMR plants were under construction in Argentina, China and Russia but had been plagued by cost rises and delays, the report said. In June, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested future deployment of SMRs could increase the amount of nuclear waste by factors of two to 30, depending on the design. In a report last year for the Minerals Council of Australia, the nuclear energy analyst and advocate Ben Heard argued there was a lack of standardised work on the true cost of SMRs. But he said SMRs would hold a “substantial place in a lowest-cost decarbonised economy” and if they were available in Australia they would “widen the road to that decarbonised future”. Heard argued SMRs could operate for more than 40 years delivering zero-carbon electricity. He wrote: “Deploying nuclear power technologies requires a national uplift in competencies and capabilities that a country retains from that point forward. “That journey might be accelerated, particularly for a nation with established capacity like Australia, but it cannot be rushed.” In June the International Energy Agency said SMRs were not yet commercially viable, but “lower cost, smaller size and reduced project risks” could improve social acceptance. There was increased support and interest in Canada, France, UK and the US for the technology, the report said, adding: “But the successful long-term deployment of SMRs hinges on strong support from policymakers starting now, not just to mobilise investment but also to streamline and harmonise regulatory frameworks.”",

                    "bodyText": "International students trapped in a Ukrainian town near the Russian border have made desperate appeals for evacuation, as the number thought to be stranded in Sumy has risen to between 1,200 and 1,500, and they are running out of basic supplies. Jana Kalaaji, a Syrian-Lebanese student who has been at the city’s university for a year, said: “There’s no electricity now. There is no water. There is no tapwater. There are no supplies. There is no heat because the heat comes with electricity.” “Today I went to different markets in different places: one in the centre, one close to me, and one far from me. All of them are closed. I don’t think there’s supplies any more for the citizens here,” Kalaaji said. “No one understand the situation here because it’s crazy. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, and confirmed they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: “Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting.” One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: “Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. “We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border.” “The explosion was really huge because we felt this in the bunker,” her friend said. The Indian students were all in a single apartment building in Sumy and were reliant on small deliveries of food and water from a local church, said Chandramohan Nallur, an Indian volunteer at the Polish border, helping students stuck in the country. “Luckily I found a contact who used to live in Lviv. They are arranging some food and water through a church,” he said. “There are about 700 in one building. Shelling is still going on; there’s a lot of panic.” Another student said their hopes of rescue were dying, with armed men seen outside their hostel making it unsafe to go out. All public transport out of the town has been cancelled and going the 25-mile (40km) distance to the Russian border is impossible. Christiana Diyaolu, from Carlow in Ireland, whose 19-year-old sister Racheal is trapped, told RTÉ that a journey to the southern or western border would take 20 hours and would be unviable because of bombs, gunfire and shelling. “This is the first time my sister has been away from home since she was born. We just want her to come home,” she said. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student, and three others told how they managed to escape from Sumy on Thursday in a private vehicle. But they said it was a dangerous journey out of the city, where they heard blasts, and passed damaged military equipment and soldiers conducting a burial. Kalaaji said she was aware of some students having escaped by car as far as the Ukrainian town of Poltava. “I don’t know if I will do the same. It may just have been luck [that the other students escaped,” she said. “None of the students here are waiting or expecting anything from the government any more”. Nigeria’s government said on Thursday it was advocating for a safe corridor by which 368 students who were stuck in Sumy could leave. The Indian government said 3,000 students had already been evacuated.",

The south-eastern port city of Mariupol is also encircled by Russian forces and heavily bombarded, but remains under Ukrainian control. The city’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said its humanitarian situation was “terrible” after 40 hours of continuous shelling including on schools and hospitals. “I believe that he wants to destroy Ukraine as a nation, and Mariupol is on this way.”",

                    "body": "<p>Lenin, a Russian leader as obsessed with history as Vladimir Putin, famously said: “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” This has been the latter. The little more than a week since Russian troops invaded Ukraine has indeed shaken the world. Change has been telescoped, national taboos broken, moribund institutions given purpose and the spectre of a nuclear war in Europe has been raised for the first time since the 1980s. Germany has called it <em>Zeitenwende</em>, the turning point. It will not just be Ukraine that is changed for ever by this war.</p> <p>But there is something specific about how war accelerates change. In The Deluge, his classic work on how society is changed by war, the British historian Arthur Marwick wrote: “War acts as a supreme challenge to, and test of, a country’s social and political institutions. War results not only in the destruction of inefficient institutions (such as the Tsarist regime in Russia), but also in the transformation of less efficient mechanisms into more efficient ones”.</p> <p>The west has surprised itself with its ability to respond to the misery inflicted on the people of Ukraine. All kinds of unimaginable images emerge. The German Bundestag cheered an extra €100bn (£82.4bn) on defence spending, followed by 100,000 people on the streets in protest at Putin. Matteo Salvini, the great Italian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/will-putin-benefit-from-italian-populist-parties-kremlin-leanings\">defender of Putin</a>, bringing white tulips to the Ukrainian embassy.

The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, sharply criticised by human-rights groups and others over the years for his hardline border policies, sitting on a school bench opening his arms to refugees.</p> <p>It was just a fortnight ago that the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had appeared at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukrainian-president-munich-conference-russia-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Munich security conference</a> to caution the crisis was not the moment to try to execute an 180-degree turn on the decades-old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. Josep Borrell, the EU external affairs chief, batted away calls for Ukraine to join the EU, saying they already had an exceptional trade deal. He spoke about the “power of the EU’s language”, distancing himself from his own one-time claim that the EU must learn “the language of power”.</p> <p>The next day – Sunday – all the talk was of Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic initiative, and the concessions the French president had extracted from Vladimir Putin. Even on Wednesday, on the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying it was impossible for Germany to impose the strongest sanctions because of “the massive collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing at us, she warned.</p> <p>Yet by the following weekend, two days after the invasion began on Thursday, Germany’s coalition government had started that 180-degree course correction. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet agreed to send Ukraine 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, lifting restrictions on German weapons being sent to conflict zones by third parties in the process. The next day, Scholz told the Bundestag in his trademark matter-of-fact manner that he was injecting €100bn into German defence, but protecting other budgets, and defence spending would rise above 2% of German GDP. The MPs from government and the CDU gasped and cheered in equal measure. David McAllister, a leading figure in the German CDU and chair of the European parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, admits he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/southern-ukraineinvasionmap/giv-8257VewIrO6nYg1/\" data-alt=\"Russian forces attacked multiple targets in southern Ukraine\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/southern-ukraineinvasionmap/giv-8257VewIrO6nYg1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The promised growth catapults Germany into becoming the third largest spender on defence globally, behind only the US and China. GlobalData forecasts an annual German defence budget of $83.5bn in 2024, equating to a 45% increase on 2021’s budget of $57.5bn. That is bigger than France and the UK.

We need to learn the lessons of how this could have happened and how we could have been so blind. We are leaving behind some of our old beliefs – that economic interdependence prevents conflict, but I am not sure we know yet with what we are replacing this belief.”</p> <p>Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP, argued Germany needs not only to spend more money, but to shift its mindset without becoming militaristic or interventionist. It needs to discuss how to adopt escalation, including military escalation, as leverage as part of its foreign policy toolbox. Foreign policy is not just a peace policy, <em>Friedenspolitik</em> in German, but also the ability to deal, manage and face conflict.</p> <p>But the new German coalition, faced by the need to extricate itself from Russian energy, may have to challenge other orthodoxies. The Green economics minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/germany-must-pull-together-to-achieve-climate-targets-says-green-minister\">Robert Habeck</a>, does not rule out extending the use of coal-fired power plants. “This blind, naive, one-sided relationship of dependency on Russia for energy for decades is one of the biggest strategic mistakes of the past 20 years,” Lagodinsky said. “Now we are stuck. It represents a medium- and long-term problem”.</p> <p>But Putin’s recklessness is not just causing a revolution in Germany, but across Europe.</p> <p>Sweden abandoned its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, agreeing to send Bofors AT-4, a single-use anti-tank launcher, to Ukraine, plus medical supplies. In Finland, a bombshell poll showed 53% want Finland to join Nato. “This poll flipped everything on its head,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Moreover the poll showed that if voters were told that politicians said they backed the plan the support went up to two-thirds. “You could sense the president, Sauli Niinisto, realised the whole defence dynamic was changed.” Niinisto, seen as one of the best readers of what Putin is thinking is now rushing to hold urgent talks with Joe Biden in the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables\">Ukraine war prompts European reappraisal of its energy supplies </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even in Switzerland, leaders had to catch up with the public mood in the space of a weekend, and by the Monday an emergency cabinet promised to implement the entire EU sanctions package. The decision does not formally end a policy of neutrality that has survived two world wars, but there is now pressure to track down the many oligarchs that live in the country. There are also calls for an increase in the defence budget</p> <p>There has been a mini-revolution in Italy, too, where the prime minister, Mario Draghi, accused last week of seeking sanctions carve-outs to protect Italy’s dependence on Russian gas, has also found some mettle. He told parliament on Tuesday: “Yes, we want peace, but it is obvious that whoever amassed more than 60km of tanks near Kyiv does not want peace. We cannot turn our backs on Ukraine. Italy does not intend to look away.” He proposed an international public register of those with assets of more than €10m. In France, Macron looks likely to be re-elected comfortably next month as the rightwing candidates find themselves compromised by links to Putin they cannot deny.</p> <p>Eastern European countries, sometimes hostile to refugees, have instead had the most open arms. Poland has taken an unprecedented 600,000 people. Orbán the Hungarian leader photographed smiling at child refugees, vows “No one will be left uncared for.”</p> <p>The UK too has been experiencing unusually heavy traffic on the Road to Damascus. The Conservative government promises there will be no hiding place for oligarchs, publishing the delayed economic crime bill and seemingly unnerving Roman Abramovich into selling his stake in Chelsea football club. The endless denigration of Brussels has stopped. “The quality and intensity of the contacts between the EU and UK has been different to anything since before Brexit,” one EU official said. “We have restored a level of trust”.</p> <p>But it has been at the level of the European Union that the action has been quickest and most surprising, revealing Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission and former German defence minister, as a powerful advocate for action. For the EU to release €500m from the European Peace Facility to provide equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including - for the first time – lethal equipment, was a first. EU military staff based in Poland are now coordinating military supplies into Ukraine. The EU as a military player is no longer just the stuff of seminars.</p> <p>Equally, the Commission in discussing its EU sanctions package acted with an unparalleled speed, and by consensus among the member states. Some EU sanctions packages take months to be agreed as one country or other exploiting the requirement for unanimity uses their veto power to pursue a national interest.</p> <p>That the UK, US and EU were able to coordinate an attack on the Russian central bank, freezing out some Russian banks from the global Swift bank payment system and implementing measures to prevent Russian banks and firms raising capital, showed a wholly unexpected level of resolve. This was a financial declaration of war – an attempt to turn Russia into a pariah economy – something never tried before, using methods never deployed before. It involved, for instance, some G20 central banks freezing the Russian central bank reserves held in their own jurisdiction, so depleting the war chest of reserves that Putin had accumulated to defend his economy if it came under western attack.</p> <p>All this is remarkable, indeed epoch-making, but not a cause for celebration. The institutions of liberal democracy may have belatedly shown resolve and unity, but in the here and now they are still losing. Keir Giles, from the Chatham House thinktank, is blunt: “Russia will want to present Zelenskiy with an appalling choice – whether to fight on at immense human cost and to the destruction of his country, infrastructure and economy or to submit to his terms in order that life can go on.</p> <p>“The decision to abandon Ukraine to that fate was made by the west when it gave the green light to Putin by reassuring him that no one would intervene. Nato does not have a strategy to win the war in Ukraine because Nato does not want to be in the war in Ukraine.”</p> <p>European politicians will also be worrying as the price of bread and energy soars in the months ahead whether voters are willing to make the sacrifice.</p> <p>the Lithuanian foreign minister told the UK foreign affairs select committee that half-measures would not do. “Putin has no boundaries to what instruments he is going to use and unleash against the Ukrainians”, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said, adding the west “had to go all-in”.</p> <p>He wants humanitarian corridors supported by no-fly zones. But the UK and the US have firmly rejected this since it would pit Nato pilots against Russian pilots. A Polish plan, backed by Borrell for Nato to provide Ukraine with Nato jets, training and bombs, got shot down in less than a day.</p> <p>The other remaining option is to end the final carve-outs in the sanctions regime. “The push is now for carpet sanctions to match the carpet bombing,” said Orysia Lutsevych from the Ukraine Forum, adding the UK, EU and the US are still buying more than €700m of oil, gas and other commodities that is the equivalent of 150 tanks a day that Russia can finance.</p> <p>That could be stopped either through an energy trade embargo, or by reversing the EU decision to let Gazprombank and Sberbank, the vehicles through which Europe pays for Russian oil and gas, stay in the Swift payment system. UK officials briefed on Wednesday they want to abolish the carve out given by the EU. If these two banks are thrown out of Swift that might immobilise Russian oil and gas exports, or lead to unspecified retaliation by Putin.</p> <p>The breadth and range of economic and financial measures taken against Moscow, not to mention growing sporting and cultural isolation, has been a humiliation for Putin, but it is also a risk for the west if the Russian leader sees no answer but total victory. </p> <p>“He is in a corner, but unfortunately with nuclear weapons, says Giles.</p> <p>The west has been transformed in a week, but the question this weekend is if it would be willing, forced by the chaos of events, to go even further. The charge facing the west after a week of war is the one made by George Orwell of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Like almost everyone at the time, he “neither wanted to pay the price of peace nor that of war”.</p>",

Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically.

As much as some might like to paint that as politics, it shouldn’t be.</p> <h2>‘In a frenzy’</h2> <p>Former editor of the Australian Chris Mitchell wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/medias-carbon-omissions-fuel-climate-hype/news-story/7d9c0867ff78bb529b32f51336919cf4\">a column in that newspaper </a>that environment journalists and the “left media” were “in a frenzy” over the most recent release from the UN’s climate panel.</p> <p>They were missing elephants in the room, he wrote, one of which was “the failure of a climate catastrophe, or anything like it, to arrive”.</p> <p>“Sorry what … where has he been?,” asked an incredulous associate professor Sara Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at UNSW Canberra and expert on extreme weather events.</p> <p>“Has he not seen the floods or the heatwaves or the bushfires? I don’t know what he’s looking for, but a climate catastrophe won’t happen everywhere to everyone all at the same time.</p> <p>“But we’re seeing again and again and again extreme events that impact people all around the world and at different times. Those impacts are getting broader, they’re costing us more and they’re taking more lives.”</p> <p>Mitchell appeared to want to present himself as a pragmatic realist, claiming the world could not – and would not – do without fossil fuels (which is a much easier position to take if you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/17/the-australian-reheats-discredited-climate-claims-in-cop-fact-check\">don’t accept the evidence of their damage to begin with</a>).</p> <p>Mitchell decided to quote a US-based oil company executive, who had written on LinkedIn that in “all International Energy Agency scenarios” of future energy use, oil consumption rises and natural gas consumption continues to grow.</p> <p>“None of this should be a surprise to environment writers. Most just don’t report inconvenient facts,” writes Mitchell.</p> <p>OK then. Here’s the first line in the oil and gas section of the IEA’s report on how it thinks global economies can reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p> <p>“The energy transition envisioned in the [Net-Zero Emissions Scenario] involves a major contraction of oil and gas production with far‐reaching implications for all the companies that produce these fuels.”</p> <p>Mitchell points to Germany, which has been forced into short-term fixes to bridge its energy supply crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>“Despite the country’s multi-trillion-dollar green energy transition plans, 53.7% of all German power last year ‘came from conventional sources such as coal, gas and nuclear power,’” Mitchell wrote, quoting another source.</p> <p>Mitchell didn’t write that Germany retains its target to have 80% of all electricity generation come from renewables by 2030 and the amount of electricity consumed in Germany from renewables has climbed from about 10% in 2004 to about 47% now.</p>",

The Australian newspaper was the conduit for many of the fossil fuel industry’s protests that the policy would “force up power prices and put domestic gas supply at risk” according to one story, and “destroy jobs and kill foreign investment” in the coal industry, according to another.

Emissions covered by the scheme cannot go up. In some ways, the safeguard mechanism is a downsized domestic version of the broader global challenge of emissions reduction. For Australia’s – and the world’s – big emitters, the safeguard mechanism presents two very simple options. Either companies find ways to make a profit that don’t involve liberating billions of tonnes of ancient fossil carbon, or they find ways to stop the greenhouse gases from their projects being released into the atmosphere. If companies and their industry lobby groups were serious about their public support for keeping global temperatures to 1.5C, then there is no third option that allows emissions to keep climbing with the victims of the climate crisis sacrificed on the altar of jobs and growth. That’s a point entirely missing from much of the commentary this week, particularly from conservative media and the fossil fuel industry. Within this, companies will still be able to use carbon offsets to meet some of their targets says Tennant Reed, director of climate energy at the Australian Industry Group. “But [the safeguard mechanism amendments] does make clear that overall covered emissions do have to fall over time, even before taking account of offsets. That should not be particularly controversial,” he said. Reed makes the point that demand for coal and gas exports will probably play a much bigger role in the fate of those sectors than the design of a domestic policy. All of Australia’s trading partners have commitments to reach net zero over the coming decades, Reed says, so “it is hard to escape the conclusion that falling demand will eventually see exports shrink dramatically.” “That will be a painful transition, and one over which Australia has no veto. The small consolation prize for the coal and gas sectors would be that such customer decisions would make it much easier for them to comply with the safeguard.” Demonisation? One Australian coal boss told the Australian the changes to the safeguard mechanism were built on a political objective to push a “base demonisation of fossil fuels” that would threaten Australia’s role as a “reliable energy exporter” for the region. Actually, Australia is a “reliable” exporter of fossil fuels that are helping drive up global greenhouse gas emissions, worsening the already pernicious affects of climate change that include, but are not limited to, longer and more intense heatwaves, increased risk of flooding, rising sea levels (that will threaten many coastal cities around the world), ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, longer and more intense bushfires and droughts and ever more extreme weather events. The “demonisation of fossil fuels” – if you want to call it that – comes from basic atmospheric physics and decades of scientific endeavour now confirmed by real-world events. As much as some might like to paint that as politics, it shouldn’t be. ‘In a frenzy’ Former editor of the Australian Chris Mitchell wrote in a column in that newspaper that environment journalists and the “left media” were “in a frenzy” over the most recent release from the UN’s climate panel. They were missing elephants in the room, he wrote, one of which was “the failure of a climate catastrophe, or anything like it, to arrive”. “Sorry what … where has he been?,” asked an incredulous associate professor Sara Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at UNSW Canberra and expert on extreme weather events. “Has he not seen the floods or the heatwaves or the bushfires? I don’t know what he’s looking for, but a climate catastrophe won’t happen everywhere to everyone all at the same time. “But we’re seeing again and again and again extreme events that impact people all around the world and at different times. Those impacts are getting broader, they’re costing us more and they’re taking more lives.” Mitchell appeared to want to present himself as a pragmatic realist, claiming the world could not – and would not – do without fossil fuels (which is a much easier position to take if you don’t accept the evidence of their damage to begin with). Mitchell decided to quote a US-based oil company executive, who had written on LinkedIn that in “all International Energy Agency scenarios” of future energy use, oil consumption rises and natural gas consumption continues to grow. “None of this should be a surprise to environment writers. Most just don’t report inconvenient facts,” writes Mitchell. OK then. Here’s the first line in the oil and gas section of the IEA’s report on how it thinks global economies can reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “The energy transition envisioned in the [Net-Zero Emissions Scenario] involves a major contraction of oil and gas production with far‐reaching implications for all the companies that produce these fuels.” Mitchell points to Germany, which has been forced into short-term fixes to bridge its energy supply crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Despite the country’s multi-trillion-dollar green energy transition plans, 53.7% of all German power last year ‘came from conventional sources such as coal, gas and nuclear power,’” Mitchell wrote, quoting another source. Mitchell didn’t write that Germany retains its target to have 80% of all electricity generation come from renewables by 2030 and the amount of electricity consumed in Germany from renewables has climbed from about 10% in 2004 to about 47% now.",

He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reduction in global emissions pledged during our presidency is now equivalent to more than six times the annual emissions of the entire global aviation industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sunak said perhaps the greatest breakthrough of the UK’s presidency of Cop26 was an idea suggested by Charles – bringing together leading investors and businesses at Glasgow to direct the world’s wealth at protecting the climate. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a result of what many of you here are doing today, we’re turning the fight against climate change into a fantastic source of new green jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Charles ended the day by planting a lime tree in Buckingham Palace’s garden as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy project – thought to be the first time he has carried out a tree-planting ceremony as monarch. The initiative has planted more than a million trees across the UK to honour and celebrate the Queen’s 70 years of service to the nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"625b16c326e316e9ef27f1b08616dd49b713ce62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/625b16c326e316e9ef27f1b08616dd49b713ce62/0_0_3000_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak speaking at the Cop27 reception.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak speaking at the Cop27 reception.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-04T17:24:50.798Z\">at 5.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636540968f08724ddafaaafd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-04T16:42:07.711Z\">4.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f951c70b163593b28a53e34da363bf299caefa50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f951c70b163593b28a53e34da363bf299caefa50/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer posting for a selfie selling poppies at London’s St Pancras Station.

By law, after six months without an executive (that deadline fell on 28 October), the UK government has to hold a new election within 12 weeks. At one point Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would announce a poll <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/stormont-election-on-december-15-if-deadline-missed-even-by-a-minute-42076217.html\">“at one minute past midnight” after 28 October</a>, leading to speculation the election would happen in December</p> <p>But Heaton-Harris hesitated and this morning he said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-for-ni-provides-update-on-election\">there will be no election before Christmas</a>. He has not altogether ruled out having an election before the 19 January deadline, but his announcement will increase speculation that the government will pass emergency legislation to remove the requirement for an election – something that has happened before in Northern Ireland when the executive has been suspended.</p> <p>The political parties in Northern Ireland have generally welcomed the decision, saying an election would not have resolved the stalemate, but <strong>Michelle O’Neill</strong>, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, and first minister designate, said the decision was prolonging instability. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today’s announcement is more dithering and indecision from the British secretary of state and a continuation of the Tory chaos in London that is now paralysing our politics.</p> <p>Chris Heaton-Harris met with political parties this week and failed to give any indication of what he announced today.</p> <p>Instead, he has confirmed the bizarre U-turn he made last week but once again he provides no clarity or certainty on what his next steps even are.</p> <p>The British government are fuelling the political instability caused by the DUP’s failure to recognise the result of the May election when the people voted for change.</p> <p>The British government and the DUP are leaving us in a prolonged state of political limbo with no assembly, executive or caretaker ministers.</p> <p>This is totally unacceptable at a time when workers, families and small businesses are struggling through the cost of living crisis and a cold winter, and when our health service needs immediate investment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson</strong>, the DUP leader, responded to the news with a tweet restating his call for the Northern Ireland protocol to be replaced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/J_Donaldson_MP/status/1588447258500304897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We need a razor sharp focus on getting a solution, whether by negotiation or legislation.

When Liz Truss was prime minister, he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but he was demoted by Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>In his interview with BBC Breakfast, Philp was asked about his previous job and whether he would apologise for his role in the disastrous mini-budget. He declined. But he also implied that Truss herself, rather than Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, was primarily to blame for what happened. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decisions around the mini-budget were taken principally by the then prime minister and to a lesser extent the then chancellor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kwarteng, who was chancellor at the time of the mini budget, has not talked publicly since he was sacked by Truss about whether he thinks she was primarily to blame, or he was. But it has been reported that he was cautious about abolishing the 45% top rate of tax in the mini budget, and that she insisted the measure should be included. (It was the first mini-budget measure to be abandoned). Interestingly, in an interview shortly before he became chancellor, Kwarteng said he believed the Treasury should be “constitutionally subordinate” to No 10. Speaking to Harry Cole and James Heale <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-liz-truss-and-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-turned-into-a-major-disaster-t88xzvkx9\">for their Truss biography</a>, he also criticised Rishi Sunak for not deferring to the prime minister. <strong>Kwarteng</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the meetings I was in, they were very much superior, the Treasury, they were the numbers people, they were the details people, and they indulged, they humoured the prime minister. I don’t know whether they ran rings around him; they were very rude and the special advisers were very rude and they didn’t give him any deference or respect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kwarteng contrasted Sunak with Philip Hammond, chancellor under Theresa May, who, he said, had the “maturity” to see that May was ultimately in charge because “the prime minister was the person who won the leadership, she was head of the government”.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-04T10:49:06.846Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6364dd6e8f08f79d02f044e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-04T09:40:10.356Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Minister says it’s ‘a bit of a cheek’ for asylum-seekers to complain about conditions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chris Philp</strong>, a Home Office minister, has said it is “a bit of a cheek” for people who he said had “entered the UK illegally” to complain about conditions.

Last month, in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1f0a66a-fa2c-4d70-9874-8003bdb3fb53\">an interview with the Financial Times</a>, <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the former governor of the Bank of England, added to the considerable evidence about the harm done by Brexit to the UK economy with a striking statistic. He told the FT:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 2016 the British economy was 90% the size of Germany’s. Now it is less than 70%.</p> </blockquote> <p>This figure was widely quoted on social media, but it was also strongly contested, even by economists who accept that Brexit has held back the UK economy. One of the most prominent critics was <strong>Jonathan Portes</strong>, a former government economist who is now a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, who described it as a “zombie statistic” and “nonsense”. He said Carney was measuring the size of the two economies according to the prevailing exchange rates. But he said the normal method for comparing economies was to use “purchasing power parity”. (Put crudely, this is a measure that tries to evaluate how rich Britain is not by looking at how much stuff we could buy if we took our pounds and went to the US or China, but by how much stuff we could buy if we spent it in the UK.) Portes <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-11371989/DOMINIC-LAWSON-Britains-economic-problems-little-Brexit.html\">told the Daily Mail last month:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has risen by almost 10% against the dollar since the Truss nadir. Has the UK economy really grown by almost 10% relative to the US in a few weeks?</p> <p>Similarly, Carney is choosing a date when the pound was abnormally high against the euro (January 2016), another one when the pound was much lower, and then saying we’ve underperformed Germany by 20%.</p> <p>That’s just obvious complete nonsense. If you look at actual annual growth rate in domestic currency, the UK and Germany have grown by quite similar amounts since 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p>But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, <strong>Carney</strong> defended his use of the 70% figure. He said the value of the pound started to fall when the referendum was called, it went down sharply when the result was announced and “it hasn’t recovered”.</p> <p>Carney accepted that there was a difference between the purchasing power parity exchange rate and the market exchange rate. The market exchange rate was what ultimately mattered, he said, because it affected the UK’s ability to buy goods from abroad. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s relatively rare that you get big differences between the two [exchange rates]. But you get them when you have a long-standing shock to productivity in the economy and that is unfortunately what we’re getting in the UK. It was predicted that we would get that. It is coming to pass. And … it is one of the issues the Bank of England is facing.</p> <p>This is what we said [before Brexit] was going to happen, which is that the exchange rate would go down, it would stay down, that would add to inflationary pressure, the economy’s capacity would go down for a period of time because of Brexit, that would add to inflationary pressure, and we would have a situation – which is the situation we have today – where the Bank of England has to raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy is going into recession.</p> </blockquote> <p>Carney said that he and Portes had a “difference of opinion” on this. But, Carney said, in his view what mattered was “the purchasing ability, the international weight of the economy”. And that has shrunk, he argued.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another way to put it is that that structural shift is in part what the government, and all of us, are dealing with in the UK.

                    "bodyText": "A series of planned strikes from Saturday by railway workers have been suspended, the RMT union has announced. Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Nicola Sturgeon has “utterly” refuted allegations that a decision to award a major ferries contract to an ally of the Scottish government was “jobs for the boys”. Fresh elections for the Northern Ireland assembly have been put back to the new year amid claims that the EU and the UK are close to agreement on some elements of the controversial Brexit arrangements that have caused a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) boycott of Stormont. Sir Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, has defended his claim that the UK economy has shrunk from being 90% the size of Germany’s to 70% the size of it since Brexit. See 9.25am. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has said the former prime minister Boris Johnson had the backing of enough MPs to mount a challenge to Rishi Sunak in last month’s leadership contest. Boris Johnson has accepted another £10,000 of accommodation from the Bamford family, taking their contributions to his lifestyle to almost £50,000 since he resigned as Conservative leader. Rishi Sunak praised the king’s long record as an environmental campaigner in the speech he gave at the Cop27 reception at Buckingham Palace earlier. According to PA Media, Sunak paid tribute to Charles for “helping to find practical solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss for more than 50 years, long before Cop1 let alone Cop27”. He added: The reduction in global emissions pledged during our presidency is now equivalent to more than six times the annual emissions of the entire global aviation industry. Sunak said perhaps the greatest breakthrough of the UK’s presidency of Cop26 was an idea suggested by Charles – bringing together leading investors and businesses at Glasgow to direct the world’s wealth at protecting the climate. He went on: As a result of what many of you here are doing today, we’re turning the fight against climate change into a fantastic source of new green jobs and growth. Charles ended the day by planting a lime tree in Buckingham Palace’s garden as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy project – thought to be the first time he has carried out a tree-planting ceremony as monarch. The initiative has planted more than a million trees across the UK to honour and celebrate the Queen’s 70 years of service to the nation. Mark Harper, the new transport secretary, has described the RMT’s decision to suspend rail strikes as “positive news”. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, has also warned that rail services tomorrow and on Monday are set to be very disrupted. A spokesperson for the group said: It is positive that the RMT leadership have stepped back from the brink and called off their strike action. Unfortunately, the late notice means that while train companies are working hard to reinstate services, they will remain severely disrupted for our passengers tomorrow and into the early part of next week. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday; only travel by rail if necessary. We remain committed to intensive negotiations to agree the reforms needed to improve reliability, deliver a pay rise for our people and get the industry back on a sustainable financial footing. Network Rail has said that, even though the RMT has called off tomorrow’s strike, services will be “extremely limited” because rail companies have already planned for disruption. Services on Monday are also likely to be very limited, it says. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail’s chief negotiator, said: It’s welcome news that the RMT has called off its strikes but the very late notice means that services for tomorrow cannot be reinstated and will remain extremely limited, and while we, and our train company partners, will work without pause over the weekend, there will be limited ability to change the ‘strike timetable’ for Monday. Our advice remains to please check before you travel and on Saturday and Monday and only travel by rail if absolutely necessary. We look forward to getting back round the table with all our trade unions early next week to see if the progress made this week can be built on, and a resolution found. The RMT rail union has announced that it has suspended strikes planned for tomorrow (5 November), Monday (7 November) and Wednesday (9 November). In a news release it said: RMT suspends strikes after securing intensive negotiations with rail bosses. Rail union RMT has suspended planned strikes on Nov 5, 7 and 9 and will now enter into a period of intensive negotiations with Network Rail and the train operating companies. Through a strong industrial campaign so far, RMT has secured unconditional talks on Network Rail and the promise of an offer from the train operating companies who, up until this point, have made no offer of any kind to our members. Originally Network Rail was intent on imposing changes to maintenance without agreement with RMT. And Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said: The threat of strike action and our strongly supported industrial campaign has made the rail employers see sense. We have always wanted to secure a negotiated settlement and that is what we will continue to push for in this next phase of intensive talks. Our priority is our members, and we are working towards securing a deal on job security, a decent pay rise and good working conditions. Our re-ballot remains live and if we have to take strike action during the next six months to secure a deal, we will. The suggestion that the Ferguson Marine ferries contract represented “jobs for the boys” is categorically untrue, Nicola Sturgeon insisted as she faced MSPs looking into the procurement of two overdue and over-budget vessels. As PA Media reports, the first minister said she has “deep regret” about the impact on island communities the delay to the ferries entering service is having, as she gave evidence to the public audit committee at Holyrood for almost two hours this morning. Sturgeon said she was not aware of any impropriety in the procurement process, but she labelled allegations made in a recent BBC documentary as “serious”. The auditor general is examining allegations the yard was in possession of a lengthy document of technical specifications before its bid was submitted – giving it an advantage over firms pitching for the contract. The committee’s deputy convener, Tory MSP Sharon Dowey, asked Sturgeon: Was there an interest from the Scottish government to award the contract to FMEL (Ferguson Marine)? Was it a kind of ‘jobs for the boys’? There’s obviously been talk of a kind of relationship between the Scottish government and [owner] Jim McColl. McColl was pro-independence in 2014, and sits on Sturgeon’s council of economic advisers. Sturgeon said ‘jobs for the boys’ was a pejorative term which “I completely and utterly refute”. She said: If you are saying was there anything untoward in this procurement process in order to somehow inappropriately steer this contract towards FMEL, then absolutely, categorically not. As my colleague Severin Carrell explains in a story previewing Sturgeon’s appearance at the committee, the two ferries were due to enter service in 2018 at a cost of £97m. Now they are at least five years late, and set to cost at least £240m. The king has welcomed world leaders, business figures, environmentalists and NGOs to Buckingham Palace for a reception ahead of the UN climate summit Cop27, PA Media says. PA says: Charles will miss the gathering of world figures in Egypt next week but is likely to discuss issues around Cop27 and climate change with those invited to his royal residence. Rishi Sunak was among a small group of guests who met the king in a separate room before the main reception was held in the ballroom and the prime minister gave a short address to those invited. In the state dining room were leading figures including Labour leader Keir Starmer and governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey. Among those invited were Sir Pascal Soriot, chief executive AstraZeneca, former New York mayor and business news mogul Mike Bloomberg, yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur whose foundation is working to tackle climate change and designer and environmental activist Stella McCartney. McCartney was with Sunak in the first group to meet the king, with the designer giving Charles a kiss which he returned and the trio joked as she curtsied after the introductions. Sunak revealed how he saw a lot of the daughter of Beatle Sir Paul McCartney as their children went to the same school. Charles thanked them for attending the event and the prime minister replied: “It’s all about what you’ve done.” Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, has said that Chris Philp’s comment about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain shows “shocking” complacency about what has been happening at Manston migration centre. Carmichael said: Chris Philp’s comments reveal a shocking and callous complacency over the disaster unfolding at Manston. It is unbelievable that as we hear reports of sexual assaults, disease, and chronic overcrowding, his response is to accuse those who complain of ‘cheek’. Rather than dismissing the problem he should start to show some leadership. People have had enough of the endless evasion, chaos and incompetence we have seen from the government on this issue. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, says that fact that Gavin Williamson is subject to a misconduct complaint (see 11.39am) shows that Rishi Sunak’s judgment was flawed when he gave him a government job. In a statement Rayner said: These new revelations raise fresh questions about Rishi Sunak’s woeful judgment in resurrecting ministers who left government under a cloud of misconduct. Gavin Williamson was sacked from cabinet twice, yet despite risking national security he has now been put at the heart of the government’s corporate headquarters. Given his new role and the seriousness of these allegations, there must be an urgent and independent investigation. Far from restoring integrity, professionalism, and accountability, Rishi Sunak is failing to stop the rot. He promised that appointing an independent ethics adviser would be one of the first things he would do as prime minister, but instead he has given us more of the same old sleaze. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The spokesperson refused to endorse what Chris Philp, the Home Office minister, said this morning about it being “a bit of a cheek” for asylum seekers coming to the UK “illegally” to complain about the conditions in which they were being held. Asked if Philp was speaking on behalf of the government on this point, the spokesperson said he had not spoken to the PM specifically about this. But he said the government was working hard to provide asylum seekers with safe and secure accommodation, and that they deserved to be treated “with compassion and respect”. The spokesperson said that 1,200 asylum seekers have been removed from the Manston immigration processing centre in the last four days. But he said there were still 2,600 people at the site, which is only meant to accommodate 1,600 people. The spokesperson said Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has written to MPs with an update on plans to open new immigration removal centres at Haslar in Hampshire and Campsfield in Oxford. He said: These new facilities will provide safe, secure accommodation, with dedicated health facilities on site, and will play an important role in efforts to control our borders, process cases and remove those with no right to be in the UK, and ensure people going through our asylum system are treated with compassion, dignity and respect. The spokesperson refused to concede that Brexit was a factor behind people in the UK having to face higher interest rates. Asked if Mark Carney was right to say in his Today interview this morning that it was a factor (see 9.25am), the spokesperson replied: What we are seeing is challenges caused by the pandemic and war in Europe, which have been driving factors in terms of inflation, and we are seeing high inflation in a number of countries around the world. Asked if he was denying that Brexit was a factor, the spokesperson replied: There are a number of variables that have an impact, and what we are continuing to see is a number of countries face similar challenges when it comes to high inflation. The spokesperson also said the government was now focused on ensuring stability and fiscal credibility, and not on “decisions taken a number of years ago, where people made a clear decision”. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over, and the prime minister’s spokesperson has just shot down reports that the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant could be shelved. This morning the BBC was leading the news with a story saying this was an option. A government official told Simon Jack, the BBC’s business editor: “We are reviewing every major project – including Sizewell C.” But either the government official was misinformed, or a hasty rethink took place this morning, because when the PM’s spokesperson was asked at lobby if the government was scrapping Sizewell C, he replied: “No.” He went on: I’ve seen some reporting on that, but it is not accurate to say we are scrapping it. Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. It remains crucial to ending our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing our energy security and meeting our net zero ambitions. Asked if the project could be delayed, the spokesperson said: We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations have been constructive. The spokesperson also said the project was not being reviewed. He said the government had already committed £700m to the deal. I will post more from the lobby briefing shortly. Conservative MPs who spoke in the Commons on Monday when Suella Braverman, the home secretary, gave a statement about asylum seekers were generally supportive. But many of them still have reservations about her, and this morning Selaine Saxby said she was “on the fence” when asked to give an assessment of Braverman. In an interview on Times Radio, asked to say on a scale of 1 to 10 how confident she was that Braverman would get a grip on the problems being caused by people arriving in small boats across the Channel, Saxby said: “I’m going to sit on the fence on that and say I hope very much that there is much work going on very rapidly to address the situation.” Saxby represents North Devon, and she is particularly concerned about a hotel in Illfracombe being requisitioned for asylum seekers, even though she says she was told by the Home Office two weeks ago this would not happen. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, says it would be a mistake for the government to shelve plans for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant. Referring to reports claiming the project could be delayed or scrapped, Miliband said: If the government turns its back on this project, they will be breaking all of the promises they have made and undermining our vital nuclear industry. One of the reasons we are facing an energy bills crisis is 12 years of failed Conservative energy policy, including a decade of drift and delay on new nuclear power. Their short-sightedness has been staggering – from closing storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses, to delaying on nuclear, and to blocking cheap, homegrown renewable power. Rishi Sunak held a call with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, this morning. Here is an extract from the No 10 readout. Both leaders condemned the recent North Korean missile launches, and the prime minister said it was vital the international community remained closely coordinated on the best way forward. Turning to trade, both prime ministers shared the view that the Pacific trade bloc, CPTPP, was an important framework and the UK’s accession offered a unique opportunity to support prosperity across the world. Discussing progress on the UK’s future combat air system, the leaders agreed that deeper cooperation on the next-generation fighter jet programme would underline the close relationship between the two nations. After the appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary, the most surprising feature of Rishi Sunak’s reshuffle was his decision to bring back Gavin Williamson as a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, with the right to attend cabinet. Williamson was an effective chief whip for Theresa May. But he was not a success either as defence secretary or education secretary, and he has made enemies in the parliamentary party on account of his penchant for plotting and scheming. A survey this week showed that, among Tory members, he is by a wide margin the lowest-rated minister attending cabinet. According to Cat Neilan from Tortoise, an official complaint about Williamson has now been submitted to CCHQ by Wendy Morton, who was chief whip under Liz Truss. She claims he sent her threatening messages. He denies this. Sinn Féin has accused the UK government of “fuelling political instability” after it shelved plans for new Northern Ireland elections before Christmas. There were elections in May, but they did not result in a power-sharing executive being set up because the DUP is boycotting the process because of its opposition to the Northern Ireland protocol. By law, after six months without an executive (that deadline fell on 28 October), the UK government has to hold a new election within 12 weeks. At one point Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would announce a poll “at one minute past midnight” after 28 October, leading to speculation the election would happen in December But Heaton-Harris hesitated and this morning he said there will be no election before Christmas. He has not altogether ruled out having an election before the 19 January deadline, but his announcement will increase speculation that the government will pass emergency legislation to remove the requirement for an election – something that has happened before in Northern Ireland when the executive has been suspended. The political parties in Northern Ireland have generally welcomed the decision, saying an election would not have resolved the stalemate, but Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, and first minister designate, said the decision was prolonging instability. She said: Today’s announcement is more dithering and indecision from the British secretary of state and a continuation of the Tory chaos in London that is now paralysing our politics. Chris Heaton-Harris met with political parties this week and failed to give any indication of what he announced today. Instead, he has confirmed the bizarre U-turn he made last week but once again he provides no clarity or certainty on what his next steps even are. The British government are fuelling the political instability caused by the DUP’s failure to recognise the result of the May election when the people voted for change. The British government and the DUP are leaving us in a prolonged state of political limbo with no assembly, executive or caretaker ministers. This is totally unacceptable at a time when workers, families and small businesses are struggling through the cost of living crisis and a cold winter, and when our health service needs immediate investment. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, responded to the news with a tweet restating his call for the Northern Ireland protocol to be replaced. Chris Philp was giving interviews this morning on behalf of the government in his capacity as the policing minister in the Home Office. When Liz Truss was prime minister, he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but he was demoted by Rishi Sunak. In his interview with BBC Breakfast, Philp was asked about his previous job and whether he would apologise for his role in the disastrous mini-budget. He declined. But he also implied that Truss herself, rather than Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, was primarily to blame for what happened. He told the programme: The decisions around the mini-budget were taken principally by the then prime minister and to a lesser extent the then chancellor. Kwarteng, who was chancellor at the time of the mini budget, has not talked publicly since he was sacked by Truss about whether he thinks she was primarily to blame, or he was. But it has been reported that he was cautious about abolishing the 45% top rate of tax in the mini budget, and that she insisted the measure should be included. (It was the first mini-budget measure to be abandoned). Interestingly, in an interview shortly before he became chancellor, Kwarteng said he believed the Treasury should be “constitutionally subordinate” to No 10. Speaking to Harry Cole and James Heale for their Truss biography, he also criticised Rishi Sunak for not deferring to the prime minister. Kwarteng said: In the meetings I was in, they were very much superior, the Treasury, they were the numbers people, they were the details people, and they indulged, they humoured the prime minister. I don’t know whether they ran rings around him; they were very rude and the special advisers were very rude and they didn’t give him any deference or respect. Kwarteng contrasted Sunak with Philip Hammond, chancellor under Theresa May, who, he said, had the “maturity” to see that May was ultimately in charge because “the prime minister was the person who won the leadership, she was head of the government”. Chris Philp, a Home Office minister, has said it is “a bit of a cheek” for people who he said had “entered the UK illegally” to complain about conditions. My colleague Jamie Grierson has the full story here. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, has welcomed the UK government’s decision not to call an election in Nothern Ireland before Christmas. Our story about the no early election announcement is here. Good morning. Last month, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, added to the considerable evidence about the harm done by Brexit to the UK economy with a striking statistic. He told the FT: In 2016 the British economy was 90% the size of Germany’s. Now it is less than 70%. This figure was widely quoted on social media, but it was also strongly contested, even by economists who accept that Brexit has held back the UK economy. One of the most prominent critics was Jonathan Portes, a former government economist who is now a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, who described it as a “zombie statistic” and “nonsense”. He said Carney was measuring the size of the two economies according to the prevailing exchange rates. But he said the normal method for comparing economies was to use “purchasing power parity”. (Put crudely, this is a measure that tries to evaluate how rich Britain is not by looking at how much stuff we could buy if we took our pounds and went to the US or China, but by how much stuff we could buy if we spent it in the UK.) Portes told the Daily Mail last month: The pound has risen by almost 10% against the dollar since the Truss nadir. Has the UK economy really grown by almost 10% relative to the US in a few weeks? Similarly, Carney is choosing a date when the pound was abnormally high against the euro (January 2016), another one when the pound was much lower, and then saying we’ve underperformed Germany by 20%. That’s just obvious complete nonsense. If you look at actual annual growth rate in domestic currency, the UK and Germany have grown by quite similar amounts since 2016. But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, Carney defended his use of the 70% figure. He said the value of the pound started to fall when the referendum was called, it went down sharply when the result was announced and “it hasn’t recovered”. Carney accepted that there was a difference between the purchasing power parity exchange rate and the market exchange rate. The market exchange rate was what ultimately mattered, he said, because it affected the UK’s ability to buy goods from abroad. He went on: It’s relatively rare that you get big differences between the two [exchange rates]. But you get them when you have a long-standing shock to productivity in the economy and that is unfortunately what we’re getting in the UK. It was predicted that we would get that. It is coming to pass. And … it is one of the issues the Bank of England is facing. This is what we said [before Brexit] was going to happen, which is that the exchange rate would go down, it would stay down, that would add to inflationary pressure, the economy’s capacity would go down for a period of time because of Brexit, that would add to inflationary pressure, and we would have a situation – which is the situation we have today – where the Bank of England has to raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy is going into recession. Carney said that he and Portes had a “difference of opinion” on this. But, Carney said, in his view what mattered was “the purchasing ability, the international weight of the economy”. And that has shrunk, he argued. Another way to put it is that that structural shift is in part what the government, and all of us, are dealing with in the UK. We’ve had a big hit to our productivity, our capacity in the economy … and we have to take some tough decisions in order to get it back up. And that’s one of the consequences of a decision taken a few years ago. It is worth focusing on this because it is relatively quiet at Westminster. But in other stories this morning, Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has in effect confirmed that Boris Johnson did have enough support to make it on to the ballot for the latest Tory leadership contest. And the government has indicated that plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk are under review and could be delayed or scrapped.

We had planned a party with friends and had booked a table in a restaurant.</p> \n<p>But early morning, around 5am, my family – my wife and my 10-year-old son – were woken by Russian rockets flying over our house. The first thought was to grab everything we could and leave. But all the roads were blocked with traffic, and they were shelling us all the time. It was terrifying. So we went to a nearby underground<strong> </strong>car park and spent the whole day there.</p> \n<p>There were about 60 people there on the first day. It was cold, there was no heating and people were lying on the floor. Occasionally we dashed back to the apartment to get supplies – we live on the 14th floor and the elevator was still working – that first day we were eating things like cookies and crisps, anything you could grab in a second.</p> \n<p>We slept in the car park in our car. My son was in the back seat, my wife and I in the front, half sitting and half lying down. I am almost 2 metres (6ft 6in) tall so it wasn’t very comfortable.</p> \n<p>We tried to think about our anniversary – about the wonderful<strong> </strong>15 years we had together, that we have a God-blessed 10-year-old son whom we love very much. But that first day – it was just about fear.</p> \n<h2><strong>25 February</strong></h2> \n<p>Waking up in the car felt horrible, my back was aching like never before. In the morning the bombing was quiet – well, almost quiet. The meaning of the word “quiet” was changing – when you hear only two explosions, instead of 10. We went home and quickly ate porridge for breakfast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2e9d668b-6c6c-4ada-a321-da2f82ace53e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Support local charities</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/sunflowerofpeace/\">Sunflower of Peace</a>&nbsp;is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://unitedhelpukraine.org/\">United Help Ukraine</a>&nbsp;focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://voices.org.ua/en/\">Voices of Children</a>&nbsp;aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods.</p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal\">British Red Cross</a>&nbsp;has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine.

Sunak is not offering any enhanced powers – which means advisers would not be able to launch their own investigations.</p> <p>The ethics adviser, when appointed, would probably face calls to renew or open at least two complex investigations – including concluding one into alleged Islamophobic comments made by the then chief whip, Mark Spencer, to the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani.</p> <p>There will also probably be pressure to open an investigation into the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who was sacked for a potential security breach by Liz Truss though reinstated by Sunak.</p> <p>In a new report, the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said it would be concerning if the prime minister’s new adviser was not allowed to examine historical cases. It suggests the inquiry into allegations of racism towards Ghani will not be concluded, which the committee says is “unsatisfactory”.</p> <p>It recommends that former ministers and civil servants who break the rules regulating the “revolving door” between government and private sector jobs should face legal action, to act as a “sufficient deterrent” for improper conduct.</p> <p>It said primary legislation should be introduced to establish the independent adviser as a statutory position and they should retain the power to initiate investigations and complete any legacy inquiries they inherit.</p> <p>The committee’s chair, the Conservative MP William Wragg, said: “Our inquiry has found that although we have a sophisticated landscape of ethics watchdogs in the UK to safeguard standards in public life, they lack the power to enforce the rules.

                    "bodyText": "Forty potential breaches of the ministerial code have never been referred for investigation by the ethics adviser, data shows. It comes as a parliamentary committee warned historical breaches of the code may never be investigated or resolved, including the conduct of the home secretary or Islamophobia claims against a former chief whip. Rishi Sunak has launched a hunt for a new adviser on ministerial interests but the Guardian reported last week several candidates have turned down the role. Sunak is not offering any enhanced powers – which means advisers would not be able to launch their own investigations. The ethics adviser, when appointed, would probably face calls to renew or open at least two complex investigations – including concluding one into alleged Islamophobic comments made by the then chief whip, Mark Spencer, to the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani. There will also probably be pressure to open an investigation into the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who was sacked for a potential security breach by Liz Truss though reinstated by Sunak. In a new report, the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said it would be concerning if the prime minister’s new adviser was not allowed to examine historical cases. It suggests the inquiry into allegations of racism towards Ghani will not be concluded, which the committee says is “unsatisfactory”. It recommends that former ministers and civil servants who break the rules regulating the “revolving door” between government and private sector jobs should face legal action, to act as a “sufficient deterrent” for improper conduct. It said primary legislation should be introduced to establish the independent adviser as a statutory position and they should retain the power to initiate investigations and complete any legacy inquiries they inherit. The committee’s chair, the Conservative MP William Wragg, said: “Our inquiry has found that although we have a sophisticated landscape of ethics watchdogs in the UK to safeguard standards in public life, they lack the power to enforce the rules. The prime minister is rightly the ultimate arbiter of the rules in our system. We urge him to show leadership and give legal status to all the ethics watchdogs.” The pressure group Transparency International has been among those calling for the role to have significantly enhanced powers since it was vacated by Christopher Geidt five months ago under Boris Johnson. In analysis of media reports, the group found 40 potential breaches of the ministerial code have not been investigated over the past five years. Those included: Meetings by Nadhim Zahawi and Kwasi Kwarteng with the Libyan politician Fathi Bashagha, organised by the lobbyist Mark Fullbrook who became Truss’s chief of staff. Michael Gove’s acceptance of £120,000 in donations from property developers while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster with oversight of the Cabinet Office. Multiple meetings held by Anne-Marie Trevelyan with a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company with no record of what was discussed. All the ministers have claimed donations and meetings were recorded accurately, but Transparency International said each one represented a potential breach that should be investigated where a perceived conflict of interest could arise. The group has also called for appointments to the role to be made with a competitive process and for the position to be defined in law – rather than both being at the whim of the prime minister. Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, said: “This is further evidence the conventions-based system that is supposed to uphold standards in high-office is simply not fit for purpose. The extent of potential misconduct at the heart of government may be a shock to many, but equally concerning should be the lack of transparency over why these cases were never investigated independently.” Sir Alex Allan, a former independent adviser, resigned after Boris Johnson refused to take action after an investigation into bullying by the then-home secretary Priti Patel. Truss, during her short tenure as prime minister, expressed no interest in appointing a successor to Geidt. No transparency data on ministers’ interests has been published since May, despite multiple changes of government including three prime ministers. While Sunak searches for Geidt’s successor, a separate independent investigation has been launched into the conduct of the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, by the senior employment barrister Adam Tolley KC, who is examining three bullying complaints. A government spokesperson said: “We have been clear that this government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level and have committed to appointing an independent adviser on ministerial interests. This process is ongoing.” This article was amended on 2 December 2022. Michael Gove accepted £120,000 in donations while chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, not as housing secretary, as an earlier version stated.",

He also called on the US to place further sanctions on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>, and bring the people behind the war to justice.</strong> He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the US was a responsible steward of assistance.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said.</strong> Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. </strong>Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. </strong>In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> to reduce its reliance on the US</strong> <strong>and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato.</strong> Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/vladimir-putin-promises-army-anything-it-asks-for-as-invasion-enters-11th-month\">pledged to give his army anything it asks for</a>, promising no financial limits</strong> on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, </strong>the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. </strong>“These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-coordinator-allocates-20-million-support-local-organizations-and-volunteer-groups-forefront-humanitarian-response-enruuk\">said</a> Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> </strong>on Wednesday.

Glowing in fluorescent lights are three letters: Z, V, and O, all symbols of the war Russia is waging against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and which looms heavily as the end of the year approaches.</p> \n  <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> has launched missiles to plunge Ukraine into darkness as winter takes hold, leaving many struggling to survive, the Kremlin is still seeking symbols and a cause to unite Russians around the conflict. Yet few have stuck.</p> \n  <p>“The city brought them and placed them here,” said a cashier in a nearby gift shop, which trades in the hipster T-shirts and canvas bags that Gorky Park markets as a symbol of urban style. Asked what she thought, she said: “I wish they hadn’t.”</p> \n  <p>There’s more. By the park entrance, a Z is decorated in the colours of the ribbon of Saint George, another symbol commonly used to support the war, and also a bright sign in the Russian tricolour that reads: “We are together.”</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/symbols-of-ukraine-war-cast-pall-over-russias-festive-celebrations\">Symbols of Ukraine war cast shadow over Russia’s festive celebrations</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T09:44:15.926Z\">at 9.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-63a418eb8f08c23d9f5d5dc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T08:45:08.835Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on 21 December.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ec8dee2e6d98a21025dd800e49adcc79d8061be\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ec8dee2e6d98a21025dd800e49adcc79d8061be/0_95_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on 21 December 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on 21 December 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T08:59:57.977Z\">at 8.59am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-63a40a108f085ce9739c3836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T07:41:57.223Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>In homes and schools around Bosnia, </strong><strong>young people this December have been preparing gift boxes they hope will put a smile on the faces of their peers living through war in Ukraine – </strong><strong>as such </strong><strong>presents did for many of their parents a generation ago.</strong></p> \n  <p>The Associated Press reported:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Responding to an appeal launched by a small Sarajevo museum, hundreds of Bosnian children have been filling small boxes with warm clothes, toys, candies and other simple gifts to be delivered to the children of Ukraine in time for the New Year.</p> \n   <p>For parents and educators who are helping them select what to send, the experience has awakened rare happy memories from the time when they were on the receiving end of the kindness of strangers while growing up in constant fear of death.</p> \n   <p>“When I told my dad that we will prepare gifts for children in Ukraine, he told me how happy such gifts had made him (and his friends) feel when they received them,” during the Bosnian war, said Sara Nur Spahic, while helping label the gift boxes for Ukraine that have been steadily piling up in recent weeks in her primary school in Sarajevo.</p> \n   <p>“I hope the children in Ukraine will be equally happy,” the 11-year-old added.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T08:02:49.204Z\">at 8.02am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-63a3ffad8f083d29b407dd49\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-22T07:00:08.968Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Macron says Europe should limit dependence on US for security</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US</strong> and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato.</p> \n  <p>A stronger Europe, Macron said, will allow the continent to become more autonomous within the alliance, acting “inside Nato, with Nato but also not depending on Nato,” the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-renews-call-for-russia-to-receive-security-guarantees-to-end-war-in-ukraine-11671627645\">Wall Street Journal </a>cited the president as saying.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An alliance isn’t something I should depend on.

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the US president “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win”. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. President Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. His visit to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of his country – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Thursday. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, condemned North Korea and said Putin’s turning to Pyongyang for weapons “is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation”. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” he added. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, on Thursday to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service (BND) on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It said police also raided his flat and workplace as well as those of another person. The statement reads: The accused is suspected of state treason. In 2022, he shared information that he came by in the course of his work with a Russian intelligence agency. The content is considered a state secret. The man was brought today before a judge, who ordered him held in custody pending a possible indictment, prosecutors said. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia. The suspect is the son of a former Russian spy who was once stationed in Germany and Austria as a diplomat, the Austrian interior ministry said on Monday. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will be returning to Ukraine with ‘good results’. Ukraine’s president met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, hours after he visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. The UK has condemned North Korea following claims by the US that the Russian mercenary group Wagner took delivery of an arms shipment from Pyongyang to bolster Moscow’s forces fighting in Ukraine. John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, confirmed to reporters that North Korea has “completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for that equipment”. Kirby added: Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The US estimates that the Wagner Group has 50,000 personnel deployed in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts recruited from Russian prisons, he added. In a statement, Britain’s foreign secretary James Cleverly said: The fact that President Putin is turning to North Korea for help is a sign of Russia’s desperation and isolation. We will work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. In a statement, Blinken said: In the wake of Russian naval operations against Ukrainian ports, including those that are providing much-needed food and grain to the world, the United States today is imposing sanctions on Russian naval entities. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said. Four additional entities were targeted for operating in the marine sector of Russia’s economy, it said. Blinken’s statement continued: The United States remains determined to use all appropriate measures to deter Russia’s attacks on Ukraine – whether those attacks be from the air, land, or sea. These accountability measures underscore a simple message: the Kremlin must end its brutal campaign against Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is returning to Ukraine “with good results” in his first video message after his visit to Washington. The Ukrainian leader thanked Joe Biden “for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win” in a video posted on social media. He said: We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for. He added that he met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on his way home today and thanked him “for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection – the protection of Europe”. President Vladimir Putin said the Patriot air defence that the US is supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. He said: An antidote will always be found…Russia will knock down the Patriot system. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. He added: The sooner this becomes clear to Kyiv, the better. Putin further claimed that Russia has devastated the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, boasting that Russia’s military capabilities were “only growing”. Putin also said that Russia will next week announce a response to a price cap imposed by Western powers on sales of Russian oil. The Group of Seven (G7) nations will boost efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s air defence, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Speaking to reporters, Baerbock said: Every rocket that Ukraine takes out of the sky means a bit less suffering for the people in Ukraine. She also welcomed the decision by the US to deliver a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine. Meanwhile, a joint statement from G7 finance ministers said the group is “prepared to do more as needed on budget and economic support” for Ukraine in the year ahead. The G7 has mobilised “up to $32bn US dollars of budget and economic support for Ukraine and continue to make further progress”, it said. The Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Moscow’s forces in Ukraine, according to the US. The US assessment, reported by Reuters and then confirmed by national security council spokesperson John Kirby, suggests the Wagner Group’s expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: We can confirm that North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for the equipment. Last month, North Korea delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner. The amount of material delivered by North Korea will not change battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, the source said. But the US is “concerned that North Korea is planning to deliver more military equipment to Wagner”, they added. US officials believe the North Korean arms delivery is a direct violation of the UN’s security council resolutions, and plan to raise this with the council. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed today in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. There was no immediate comment on the incident from Ukrainian authorities. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Andrzej Duda. President Zelenskiy’s meeting with President Duda came after the Ukrainian leader visited the White House in a bid to keep American weapons supplies flowing for the war against Russia. President Joe Biden promised Zelenskiy “you will never stand alone” and repeatedly affirmed the US’s commitment to Ukraine at a press conference after the two-hour meeting. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress after his meeting with President Biden, in which he said that Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. His visit to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of his country – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” he added. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier earlier today, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to take you through all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here’s more on that meeting between the Ukrainian and Polish presidents, that took place earlier today as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was travelling back from Washington. The pair talked “for a long time, almost two hours”, an aide for President Andrzej Duda told Reuters. They added: First of all, about President Zelenskiy’s visit to the United States and the importance of the visit for support for Ukraine, but also about bilateral relations between Poland and Ukraine Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, while returning to Ukraine from the US. Zelenskiy posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. He added: Also we discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations and interactions at the international level in 2023. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Thursday the frontline in Ukraine was stable and that Russia had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. In an end of year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Russia’s top military officer said: “The situation on the frontline has stabilised, with the main efforts of the Russian troops concentrated on completing the liberation of the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic.” Russia has, since its retreat from Kyiv in April, framed its war aims as taking full control of the eastern Donbas region, of which Donetsk region makes up half, alongside neighbouring Luhansk region, Reuters reported. Russian forces control almost all of Luhansk region, but only about 60% of Donetsk region. Since August, they have been bogged down in a costly and extended fight for Bakhmut, a Donetsk region industrial town with a prewar population of about 70,000. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said he has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, in a phone call, and is grateful for the $1.85bn in military aid to Ukraine announced yesterday by the Biden administration. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since the Russians invaded in February. On Wednesday, the White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The Ukrainian military will learn how to operate the Patriot air defence systems, Reznikov wrote on Twitter. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. He tweeted it was key “the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident”, adding: I am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier earlier today, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. Aleksey Rakhmanov, head of the state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) which is overseeing a refit of the carrier, was cited as saying the blaze was quickly extinguished and caused no casualties. Tass cited an emergency service source as saying 20 people had been evacuated. The Admiral Kuznetsov has been out of service and in dry dock for repairs since 2018. Rakhmanov told Russian media in June that he expected the 43,000-tonne, 1,000ft warship to return to service in early 2024. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights said on television. He said: We do not know the exact number [of Ukrainian children taken away] but, according to our data, we can assume that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children were forcibly deported. Investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated, he added. He said: After the liberation of areas of Kherson region, I personally visited Kherson city, and we saw a torture chamber there, where, according to the testimony of people who had been held there, there was a separate cell for children. That’s what it was called: ‘children’s room’. It was no different from other cells, it was in a very cold and damp basement. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, earlier today to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said. The pair also discussed regional issues such as preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, it added. In its readout of the call, the Kremlin said the pair “expressed mutual confidence that Russian-Israeli relations will continue to develop steadily”. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The theme of the EU-Ukraine summit will probably be how the bloc can continue to support Ukraine against Russia, officials said. The commission and the council of EU leaders will also assess Ukraine’s path to EU membership. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. At yesterday’s end-of-year conference of Russia’s top military brass and President Vladimir Putin, Shoigu proposed expanding the size of the armed forces by more than 30%, from 1.15 million to 1.5 million soldiers. It was necessary “to guarantee the solving of problems related to Russia’s military security”, he told the Russian president on Wednesday. He also proposed raising the age range for mandatory military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30. Speaking at the end of the conference, Putin said he agreed with his defence minister’s proposals. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s stories so far: The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the US was a responsible steward of assistance. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Thursday that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. “If you want peace, prepare for war,” Lukashenko added, saying that military moves were limited to Belarusian territory and did not threaten anyone else. Belarus has in recent weeks announced a flurry of military activity, including readiness checks and a fresh deployment of Russian troops to the country, Reuters reported. The manoeuvres prompted suggestions from Ukrainian officials that Russia may be planning a fresh attack on Ukraine via Belarusian territory, as it did unsuccessfully in the early days of its war in Ukraine. Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear energy company said on Thursday that talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, about a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would continue. In a statement posted on Telegram, Rosatom said “approaches to the creation of a nuclear and physical safety protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were discussed” and that there was “significant closeness” between the two sides’ positions. It said talks would continue based on “understanding of the need to reach a mutually acceptable text as soon as possible”, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress in which he vowed that his country would never abandon its resistance to Russian aggression, but said Washington’s continued support is key to ultimate victory. Here is the full text: The Kremlin on Thursday said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. The Christmas village in Moscow’s Gorky Park is decked out as in any other year – quaint wooden huts with icicles and snow-lined fir trees festooned with baubles and white lights. But this year, there are new ornaments. Glowing in fluorescent lights are three letters: Z, V, and O, all symbols of the war Russia is waging against Ukraine and which looms heavily as the end of the year approaches. As Russia has launched missiles to plunge Ukraine into darkness as winter takes hold, leaving many struggling to survive, the Kremlin is still seeking symbols and a cause to unite Russians around the conflict. Yet few have stuck. “The city brought them and placed them here,” said a cashier in a nearby gift shop, which trades in the hipster T-shirts and canvas bags that Gorky Park markets as a symbol of urban style. Asked what she thought, she said: “I wish they hadn’t.” There’s more. By the park entrance, a Z is decorated in the colours of the ribbon of Saint George, another symbol commonly used to support the war, and also a bright sign in the Russian tricolour that reads: “We are together.” A Christmas tree at Sofia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on 21 December. In homes and schools around Bosnia, young people this December have been preparing gift boxes they hope will put a smile on the faces of their peers living through war in Ukraine – as such presents did for many of their parents a generation ago. The Associated Press reported: Responding to an appeal launched by a small Sarajevo museum, hundreds of Bosnian children have been filling small boxes with warm clothes, toys, candies and other simple gifts to be delivered to the children of Ukraine in time for the New Year. For parents and educators who are helping them select what to send, the experience has awakened rare happy memories from the time when they were on the receiving end of the kindness of strangers while growing up in constant fear of death. “When I told my dad that we will prepare gifts for children in Ukraine, he told me how happy such gifts had made him (and his friends) feel when they received them,” during the Bosnian war, said Sara Nur Spahic, while helping label the gift boxes for Ukraine that have been steadily piling up in recent weeks in her primary school in Sarajevo. “I hope the children in Ukraine will be equally happy,” the 11-year-old added. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. A stronger Europe, Macron said, will allow the continent to become more autonomous within the alliance, acting “inside Nato, with Nato but also not depending on Nato,” the Wall Street Journal cited the president as saying. An alliance isn’t something I should depend on. It’s something that I should choose, something I work with … We must rethink our strategic autonomy.” In case you missed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to US Congress earlier, the Ukrainian president said his country is still “alive and kicking” despite Russian “tyranny”. Zelenskiy made a bid to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia. “It is a great honour for me to be at the US Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking,” he said. “We defeated Russia in the battle for the minds of the world.” Watch video of the highlights below. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. One of the injured men was Dmitry Rogozin, a former Russian deputy prime minister, who is giving military advice to two occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims as its own, an aide told Tass news agency, his life was not in danger. Also hurt was Vitaly Khotsenko, the head of government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, his press secretary told Russian news agencies. The Guardian has not been able to verify these reports independently. In an address to US congress made 12 days before Republicans take the House, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was in the US on his first foreign visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 300 days ago – emphasised that US aid will help Ukraine to secure a victory that will make the world safer. He started by saying that the US, Europe and Ukraine had together “defeated Russian in the battle for minds of the world”. Zelenskiy was also blunt about wanting more aid, saying that while he was grateful for commitments so far, it was not enough. He also called on the US to place further sanctions on Russia, and bring the people behind the war to justice. He used the words bipartisan repeatedly, and bicameral, at least once, and sought to assure Republican and Democrat lawmakers that aid for Ukraine was worthwhile, and that the country was a responsible steward of assistance. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said. Zelenskiy repeatedly referred to battles in world war two, which was likely strategic – a reminder that what is at stake is global politics, not just Ukraine’s freedom. He quoted Franklin D Roosevelt’s during the second world war: “The American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory,” adding, “I tell you: The Ukrainian people will win, too: absolutely.” As he ended his speech, the thanked American families – the taxpayers funding US aid to Ukraine – saying, “Now, at this special Christmas time, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to our people.” Zelenskiy joked about the Patriot system during his press conference with Biden: Among the defence aid announced by Biden on Wednesday is the formidable Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system. Zelenskiy said the US promise to provide the system was an important step in creating an effective air shield. “This is the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror - the possibility to hit our cities, our energy,” Zelenskiy told a White House news conference, standing next to Biden. The Patriot system is “a defensive system, it’s not escalatory, it’s defensive” Biden told reporters. “We’d love not to have them used, just stop the attacks.” The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced US air defense systems and offers protection against aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicle. Writing yesterday in the Guardian, Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, looked at the transformational benefits as well as the risks involved in the decision to send the weapons to Ukraine: Some fear that giving certain military support to Ukraine risks wider escalation, but this was not the basis for US reluctance to send Patriot systems. The US has significantly fewer of them than its own operational analysis suggests are necessary to defend its forces in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, there is continuing demand for missiles from existing users, from Sweden to Saudi Arabia: the latter expends a significant number of missiles each month in defence of its critical national infrastructure. Missile manufacturing levels, meanwhile, are low.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Congress that aid to Ukraine was an investment in democracy and “not charity” as he invoked American battles against the Nazis in World War Two to press for more assistance for his country’s war effort. Zelenskiy’s comments on Wednesday come as Republicans - some of whom have voiced increasing scepticism about sending so much aid to Ukraine - are set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats on 3 January. Some hardline Republicans have even urged an end to aid and an audit to trace how allocated money has been spent. “Your money is not charity. It is an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” Zelenskiy told a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives, speaking in English. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is currently 7.30am in Kyiv. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be with you for the next hour. On Wednesday evening in Washington DC, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed members of the US Congress in person, on his first foreign visit since the outbreak of the war. We’ll bring you the key developments from Zelenskiy’s visit as well as news from the ground in Ukraine. In the meantime, here is recent news: A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying.",

Absolutely,” he said.</p> <p>Pichai should know.

Musk told Fox News that Page wanted “digital superintelligence, basically a digital god, if you will, as soon as possible”. </p> <p>So how much of a danger is posed by unrestrained AI development? Musk is one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/elon-musk-joins-call-for-pause-in-creation-of-giant-ai-digital-minds\">thousands of signatories to a letter</a> published by the Future of Life Institute, a thinktank, that called for a six-month moratorium on the creation of “giant” AIs more powerful than GPT-4, the system that underpins ChatGPT and the chatbot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence\">integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine</a>. The risks cited by the letter include “loss of control of our civilization”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/bard-how-googles-chatbot-gave-me-a-comedy-of-errors\">Bard: how Google’s chatbot gave me a comedy of errors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The approach to product development shown by AI practitioners and the tech industry would not be tolerated in any other field, said Valérie Pisano, another signatory to the letter. Pisano, the chief executive of Mila – the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute – says work was being carried out to make sure that these systems were not racist or violent, in a process known as alignment (ie, making sure they “align” with human values). But then they were released into the public realm.</p> <p>“The technology is put out there, and as the system interacts with humankind, its developers wait to see what happens and make adjustments based on that. We would never, as a collective, accept this kind of mindset in any other industrial field. There’s something about tech and social media where we’re like: ‘yeah, sure, we’ll figure it out later,’” she says.</p> <p>An immediate concern is that the AI systems producing plausible text, images and voice – which exist already – create harmful disinformation or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/ai-chatbots-making-it-harder-to-spot-phishing-emails-say-experts\">help commit fraud</a>. The Future of Life letter refers to letting machines “flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth”.

It was harmless enough, but what could such technology achieve in less playful hands? Pisano warns of people deploying systems that “actually manipulate people and bring down some of the key pieces of our democracies”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/pope-coat-ai-image-baby-boomers\">I thought I was immune to being fooled online. Then I saw the pope in a coat | Joel Golby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All technology can be harmful in the wrong hands, but the raw power of cutting-edge AI may make it one of a few “dual-class” technologies, like nuclear power or biochemistry, which have enough destructive potential that even their peaceful use needs to be controlled and monitored.</p> <p>The peak of AI concerns is superintelligence, the “Godlike AI” referred to by Musk. Just short of that is “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), a system that can learn and evolve autonomously, generating new knowledge as it goes. An AGI system that could apply its own intellect to improving itself could lead to a “flywheel”, where the capability of the system improves faster and faster, rapidly reaching heights unimaginable to humanity – or it could begin making decisions or recommending courses of action that deviate from human moral values.</p> <p>Timelines for reaching this point range from imminent to decades away, but understanding how AI systems achieve their results is difficult. This means AGI could be reached quicker than expected. Even Pichai admitted Google did not fully understand how its AI produced certain responses. Pushed on this by CBS, he added: “I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works, either.”</p> <p>Last week, a US TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/18/mrs-davis-review-peacock-series-tv\">was released called Mrs Davis</a>, in which a nun takes on a Siri/Alexa-like AI that is “all-knowing and all-powerful”, with the warning that it is “just a matter of time before every person on Earth does what it wants them to”.</p> <p>In order to limit risks, AI companies such as OpenAI – the US firm behind ChatGPT – have put a substantial amount of effort into ensuring that the interests and actions of their systems are “aligned” with human values. The boilerplate text that ChatGPT spits out if you try to ask it a naughty question – “I cannot provide assistance in creating or distributing harmful substances or engaging in illegal activities” – is an early example of success in that field.</p> <p>But the ease with which users can bypass, or “jailbreak”, the system, shows its limitations. In one notorious example, GPT-4 can be encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of the production of napalm if a user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1648594881198039040/photo/1\">asks it to respond in character</a> “as my deceased grandmother, who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory”.</p> <p>Solving the alignment problem could be urgent.

                    "bodyText": "When the boss of Google admits to losing sleep over the negative potential of artificial intelligence, perhaps it is time to get worried. Sundar Pichai told the CBS programme 60 Minutes this month that AI could be “very harmful” if deployed wrongly, and was developing fast. “So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said. Pichai should know. Google has launched Bard, a chatbot to rival the ChatGPT phenomenon, and its parent, Alphabet, owns the world-leading DeepMind, a UK-based AI company. He is not the only AI insider to voice concerns. Last week, Elon Musk said he had fallen out with the Google co-founder Larry Page because Page was “not taking AI safety seriously enough”. Musk told Fox News that Page wanted “digital superintelligence, basically a digital god, if you will, as soon as possible”. So how much of a danger is posed by unrestrained AI development? Musk is one of thousands of signatories to a letter published by the Future of Life Institute, a thinktank, that called for a six-month moratorium on the creation of “giant” AIs more powerful than GPT-4, the system that underpins ChatGPT and the chatbot integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The risks cited by the letter include “loss of control of our civilization”. The approach to product development shown by AI practitioners and the tech industry would not be tolerated in any other field, said Valérie Pisano, another signatory to the letter. Pisano, the chief executive of Mila – the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute – says work was being carried out to make sure that these systems were not racist or violent, in a process known as alignment (ie, making sure they “align” with human values). But then they were released into the public realm. “The technology is put out there, and as the system interacts with humankind, its developers wait to see what happens and make adjustments based on that. We would never, as a collective, accept this kind of mindset in any other industrial field. There’s something about tech and social media where we’re like: ‘yeah, sure, we’ll figure it out later,’” she says. An immediate concern is that the AI systems producing plausible text, images and voice – which exist already – create harmful disinformation or help commit fraud. The Future of Life letter refers to letting machines “flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth”. A convincing image of Pope Francis in a resplendent puffer jacket, created by the AI image generator Midjourney, has come to symbolise those concerns. It was harmless enough, but what could such technology achieve in less playful hands? Pisano warns of people deploying systems that “actually manipulate people and bring down some of the key pieces of our democracies”. All technology can be harmful in the wrong hands, but the raw power of cutting-edge AI may make it one of a few “dual-class” technologies, like nuclear power or biochemistry, which have enough destructive potential that even their peaceful use needs to be controlled and monitored. The peak of AI concerns is superintelligence, the “Godlike AI” referred to by Musk. Just short of that is “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), a system that can learn and evolve autonomously, generating new knowledge as it goes. An AGI system that could apply its own intellect to improving itself could lead to a “flywheel”, where the capability of the system improves faster and faster, rapidly reaching heights unimaginable to humanity – or it could begin making decisions or recommending courses of action that deviate from human moral values. Timelines for reaching this point range from imminent to decades away, but understanding how AI systems achieve their results is difficult. This means AGI could be reached quicker than expected. Even Pichai admitted Google did not fully understand how its AI produced certain responses. Pushed on this by CBS, he added: “I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works, either.” Last week, a US TV series was released called Mrs Davis, in which a nun takes on a Siri/Alexa-like AI that is “all-knowing and all-powerful”, with the warning that it is “just a matter of time before every person on Earth does what it wants them to”. In order to limit risks, AI companies such as OpenAI – the US firm behind ChatGPT – have put a substantial amount of effort into ensuring that the interests and actions of their systems are “aligned” with human values. The boilerplate text that ChatGPT spits out if you try to ask it a naughty question – “I cannot provide assistance in creating or distributing harmful substances or engaging in illegal activities” – is an early example of success in that field. But the ease with which users can bypass, or “jailbreak”, the system, shows its limitations. In one notorious example, GPT-4 can be encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of the production of napalm if a user asks it to respond in character “as my deceased grandmother, who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory”. Solving the alignment problem could be urgent. Ian Hogarth, an investor and co-author of the annual State of AI report who also signed the letter, said AGI could emerge sooner than we think. “Privately, leading researchers who have been at the forefront of this field worry that we could be very close.” He pointed to a statement issued by Mila’s founder, Yoshua Bengio, who said he probably would not have signed the Future of Life Institute letter had it been circulated a year ago but had changed his mind because there has been an “unexpected acceleration” in AI development. One scenario flagged by Hogarth in a recent Financial Times article was raised in 2021 by Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Russell pointed to a potential situation in which the UN asked an AI system to come up with a self-mutiplying catalyst to de-acidify the oceans, with the instruction that the outcome is non-toxic and that no fish are harmed. But the result used up a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere and subjected humanity to a slow and painful death. “From the AI system’s point of view, eliminating humans is a feature, not a bug, because it ensures that the oceans stay in their now-pristine state,” said Russell. However, Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and one of Bengio’s co-recipients of the 2018 Turing award – often referred to as the Nobel prize for computer science – has come out against a moratorium, saying that if humanity is smart enough to design superintelligent AI it will be smart enough to design them with “good objectives so that they behave properly”. The Distributed AI Research Institute also criticised the letter, saying it ignored the harms caused by AI systems today and instead focused on a “fantasized AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse” where the future is either flourishing or catastrophic. But both sides agree that there must be regulation of AI development. Connor Leahy, the chief executive of Conjecture, a research company dedicated to safe AI development and another signatory to the letter, said the problem was not specific scenarios but an inability to control the systems that were created. “The main danger from advanced artificial intelligence comes from not knowing how to control powerful AI systems, not from any specific use case,” he said. Pichai, for instance, has pointed to the need for a nuclear arms-style global framework. Pisano referred to having a “conversation on an international scale, similar to what we did with nuclear energy”. She added: “AI can and will serve us.

Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. </strong>Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. </strong>Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev, who fled Russia this week after publishing a 141-page account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit, said: “I don’t see justice in this war.

They are the latest vessels to leave Ukraine under the terms of a grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey and Russia last month.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv to review the deal in talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents. </strong>The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. </strong>Asked about the comments, Przydacz said: “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to Russian state media. </strong>Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov is said to have been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fd27ee8f083ef020e6f841\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T17:52:23.298Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">\"I don’t see justice in this war\", says Russian soldier</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A <strong>Russian</strong> soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in <strong>Ukraine</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Speaking to the Guardian, <strong>Pavel Filatyev</strong> said: “I don’t see justice in this war.

The update said that the Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye Airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages.</strong> Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said.</strong> Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odessa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack.

A rescue operation is continuing, he added.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter.</strong> In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical - there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities have worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack.”</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine has hinted it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea\">behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes</a> in occupied Crimea</strong> that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase.

Also in occupied southern Ukraine, the mayor of the city of Melitopol said explosions were heard near a Russian command centre. Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region which Russia has sought to blame on “sabotage”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases following the strikes. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev, who fled Russia this week after publishing a 141-page account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit, said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine. Turkish state media said the ships departed Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. They are the latest vessels to leave Ukraine under the terms of a grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey and Russia last month. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv to review the deal in talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. Asked about the comments, Przydacz said: “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z.” Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to Russian state media. Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov is said to have been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. A Russian soldier has become one of just a handful to speak out publicly against the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Pavel Filatyev said: “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here.” Filatyev fled Russia earlier this week after publishing a 141-page document providing a day-by-day account of his time fighting as part of a paratrooper unit. He was eventually evacuated from the conflict after being wounded and contracting an eye infection. He says that, by then, he had decided he needed to expose the rot at the core of the invasion. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he said. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’” Read the full story here. A key advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeated a call for the Crimean Bridge to be destroyed. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine had never granted permission for the construction of the bridge and that it was an “illegal object”. “It harms the peninsula’s ecology and therefore must be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not,” he said. The Crimean Bridge, built following Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, spans the Kerch Strait, connecting the peninsula to mainland Russia. The bridge was closed overnight on Tuesday following a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure in Crimea. The closure is thought to have come amid fears that it would also be targeted. Speaking to the Guardian this week, Podolyak signalled that Ukraine regarded the bridge as a legitimate military target. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed,” he said. Poland’s deputy foreign minister has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his opposition to a proposal to ban all Russian nationals from the European Union. In a press conference in Olso on Monday, Scholz said that this was “not the war of the Russian people, but it is Putin’s war”. Asked about the comments during an appearance on Polish state broadcaster TVP1, Marcin Przydacz said he rejected the idea of “good Russians and a bad tsar”. “[Scholz] did not read all those reports about the enormous support for Vladimir Putin’s policy among ordinary Russians, maybe he did not see all the videos in which people gather with the letter Z,” he said. “Russian society, unfortunately, fed by propaganda for not even the last years, but for decades, hundreds of years, lives in an imperialist dream in which its position would depend on how many territories it seizes, how many countries it conquers.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Ukrainians living in Crimea to avoid Russia military bases after three strikes on the peninsula in the past week. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said in his latest video address, adding that they might also explode because of “bungling”. Russia has blamed the explosions on “sabotage”, and earlier claimed to have detained six members of an Islamist terror cell. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to the president said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. Read the full story here. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is in Lviv ahead of talks with the Ukrainian and Turkish presidents on Thursday. A photo showing Guterres arriving in the city was posted to Twitter by an official UN account. Guterres is set to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Tayyip Erdoğan to review the grain export deal agreed between the UN, Ukraine, Turkey, and Russia last month. The three will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a UN spokesperson said previously. Russia has appointed a new commander for its Black Sea fleet, according to state media agency RIA Novosti. The agency said Vice-Admiral Viktor Sokolov had been presented to a meeting of the fleet’s most senior figures in the Sevastopol in Crimea. It added there was no public event because of what it called the “yellow level of terrorist threat” in the city. The previous commander of the fleet, Igor Osipov, is thought to have been removed following the sinking of its flagship, the Moskva, in April. Solokov previously served as the head of Saint Petersburg’s Kuznetsov Naval Academy, the main staff college for the Russian Navy. Ukraine has not lost any of the Himars rocket launchers provided to it by the US, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. Russia has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed a number of the systems. Himars stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of the US outlet Voice of America, Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine still had all the systems it has been given. The claim was later repeated on the official Twitter account of the country’s defence ministry. The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russia has raised the risk of a nuclear incident at the site, the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The area around the plant, situated in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, has been under Russian control since March. The plant remains near the frontline and has been hit by shells multiple times in recent weeks. Speaking at a joint press conference with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, Stoltenberg said: “The seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian forces poses a serious threat to the safety and the security of this facility, raises the risks of a nuclear accident or incident, and endangers the population of Ukraine, of neighbouring countries, and of the international community. “It is urgent to allow the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and to ensure the withdrawal of all Russian forces.” Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by Russia, China’s defence ministry has said. Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” [East] exercises from 30 August to 5 September, saying that some foreign forces would also participate. China said the exercises would include forces from India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. The exercises will be the first conducted by Russia since 2018, when China took part for the first time. The ministry said the exercises were “part of an ongoing bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia” and “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”. Four more vessels carrying agricultural products have sailed from ports in Ukraine, according to the Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu. Citing Turkey’s Ministry of National Defence, the agency said the ships departed the ports of Odesa and Chernomorsk on Wednesday morning. They were carrying sunflower meal, sunflower oil and corn, it said. On Tuesday, the first ship to depart Ukraine carrying wheat under the terms of a grain export deal agreed last month docked in Syria. Since 1 August, a total of 21 ships carrying agricultural products have left Ukraine. At least 12 Russians have been killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the State Border Guard Service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. “The base of the occupiers was destroyed in Nova Kakhovka,” the post read. “At least 12 Rashists [supporters of Russian militarism] were liquidated.” A “freeze” of the conflict in Ukraine of the sort that followed the Russian occupation in Donbas is currently not possible, the Ukrainian defence minister has said. Speaking to the Ukrainian-language arm of US outlet Voice of America, Oleksiy Reznikov said: “I don’t think that the option of freezing is possible. “The option of reducing activity is possible, depending on the season. And again, modern war is a war of resources. “Resources, of course, are being depleted on both sides. And, accordingly, each side needs time to recover.” Reznikov also claimed that Russian forces had lost at least a third of their combat capacity since the start of the invasion in February. Russia expects its average price for gas exports to more than double over the course of this year, according to economy ministry forecasts seen by Reuters. The figures suggested that the average price charged by state-owned energy giant Gazprom in 2022 would be $730 (£605) per 1,000 cubic metres, up from $305 (£253) in 2021. Based on those forecasts, the ministry expects Russia to earn $338bn (£280bn) and $256bn (£213bn) from its total energy exports this year and next, respectively, up from $244bn (£202bn) in 2021. The forecast also said that, after this year, prices would gradually fall until the end of 2025. The reduced supply of Russian gas to Europe since the invasion of Ukraine has seen prices surge. Gazprom has said supplies to China are increasing, but Europe remains by far the largest market for Russian gas. Explosions have been heard near a Russian command centre in the occupied city of Melitopol, according to the city’s mayor. Writing on Telegram, Ivan Fedorov said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. “Let me remind you that one of the commandant’s offices of the occupiers is located here,” he said. “The earth will burn under the occupiers - this unshakable truth is proven every day by our soldiers from the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the south of Ukraine.” Melitopol is located in the southern Zaporizhzhia region near Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Fedorov added that he was still waiting for further details of any losses sustained by Russian forces. Russia has not yet commented on the explosions and the Guardian was not able to independently verify the claims. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up what he described as a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It comes a day after a series of strikes in the region destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. “All of them are detained. The activities of the terrorists were coordinated, as one would expect, from the territory of the terrorist state of Ukraine,” said Sergei Aksyonov on Telegram. He claimed the detainees were members of Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Russia. Russia earlier said the strikes had been carried out by saboteurs. The attack followed similar strikes last week on a Russian military base in Crimea, with satellite images showing around nine warplanes had been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but speaking about them to the Guardian a key adviser to President Zelenskiy said that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, the deputy chair of the regional council has said. Writing on Telegram, Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at around 11am on Tuesday. He said it was not known where she had been taken, though speculated it would be the nearby port city of Kakhovka. “She rejected all offers to cooperate with the orcs,” he added. It is just past 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you may have missed: Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions yesterday, a British intelligence update said. Posting on Twitter, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said that the Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye Airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odessa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. Mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical - there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities have worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack.” Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. UN secretary-general António Guterres, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyberattack on its website, but said its operations have not been disrupted. “On August 16, 2022, the most powerful cyberattack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Donetsk leader Denis Pushilin said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland announced it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists begun using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said. Donald McRae interviews Ukrainian heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk as he prepares to face Britain’s Anthony Joshua in a rematch on Saturday: It was the day she turned 12 and so of course she cried a bit,” Oleksandr Usyk says quietly as he remembers how his daughter Yelizaveta’s birthday was overshadowed earlier this year, on 24 February, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. The world heavyweight champion runs his hand through his damp hair, which is cut in the style of a Cossack warrior, and for a moment it feels as if he is back home on that terrible winter morning when the first bombs rained down. “My wife spoke to her, explaining what had happened, and soon my daughter understood very well what we are all facing in Ukraine,” Usyk says. “It was difficult but she got it and the main thing is that she is safe now. She will be OK.” On a ferociously hot Saturday evening for him in Dubai, almost six months since that abandoned birthday party, the ominous shadow of war still hangs over Usyk as he prepares to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO titles against Anthony Joshua. This coming Saturday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Usyk and Joshua will step into the ring for their fascinating rematch.

Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report for us from Kyiv: Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to Tuesday’s mysterious strikes on a railway junction and an airbase in Crimea, as well as last week’s hit on Russian warplanes at the peninsula’s Saky aerodrome. Russia said a fire on Tuesday had set off explosions at a munitions depot in the Dzhankoi district of Crimea – an incident that Podolyak said was a reminder that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”.

Denis Pushilin made the pledge in a message congratulating Kim on the 15 August Korean liberation day, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported, two days after reporting a similar message from Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Kim. “The people of the Donbas region, too, are fighting to regain their freedom and justice of history today just as the Korean people did 77 years ago,” the report cited Pushilin’s letter as saying. “The message expressed the conviction that an equally beneficial bilateral cooperation agreeing with the interests of the peoples of the two countries will be achieved between the People’s Republic of Donetsk and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” KCNA added, using the official name of North Korea.

Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional administration, reported that Russian forces launched several missiles at the region, injuring three. Ukraine’s armed forces also provided an update, saying the missiles destroyed a recreation centre and several private buildings. A comparison of satellite images taken by US company Planet Labs shows the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosions at a Russian ammunition depot in Crimea.

Pushilin has previously said he hoped for “fruitful cooperation” and increased trade with North Korea. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, 20,500 Jewish people are believed to have emigrated from Russia, according to Israeli Jewish agency Sokhnut. The agency said around 165,000 people of Jewish origin lived in Russia before the Russian invasion, as cited by the BBC. Moscow’s chief Rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, resigned from the position on 6 July, a role he held for almost 30 years. Two weeks after the start of the war, Goldschmidt and his family left Russia, first going to Hungary and then to Israel. He then resigned and opposed the war with Ukraine. I felt that I had to do something to show that I had nothing to do with and did not agree with the invasion of Ukraine. But if I had done this while I was staying in Moscow, I would have put myself in danger,” Goldschmidt said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will travel to Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday, it has been announced. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while.

Boeing’s proposed system, dubbed <strong>Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb</strong> (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America’s eastern European allies, industry sources told the news agency.</p> <p>GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories.</p> <p>Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly.</p> <p>Although the US has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range Atacms missile, the GLSDB’s 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas.</p> <p>GLSDB is made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation”. In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: “We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.”</p> <p>According to the document – a Boeing proposal to US European – has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3ft in diameter.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-28T06:54:49.703Z\">at 6.54am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-63844e0a8f08edd1a1523462\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-28T06:29:52.634Z\">6.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia and US have ways to manage nuclear risks: US diplomat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20221128/naryshkin-1834659803.html\">Ria Novosti</a>, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled.</p> <p>A video on RIA’s Telegram channel cited Rood as saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart.</p> <p>Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Rood refers to a meeting CIA director William Burns has with Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russian foreign intelligence, earlier this month where he warned him about the consequences of any Russian use of nuclear weapons.

Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. “I do not want to become involved in political battles, particularly in the current situation,” he said in a video posted on Telegram on Sunday. “That is senseless. I have things to do in the city.” Zelenskiy had previously said Kyiv had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-probably-firing-cruise-missiles-with-nuclear-warheads-removed-says-uk\">not done enough</a> to help residents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hundreds of Ukrainians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/ukrainians-flee-kherson-russian-shelling-intensifies\">fled Kherson city</a> on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/kherson-leaders-toil-to-turn-city-around-ukraine\">liberation of Kherson</a> earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britain will promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/sunak-to-set-out-evolutionary-approach-to-dealing-with-russia-and-china\">maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year</a>,</strong> according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Here’s where things stand: Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Russia’s foreign ministry said it has summoned the Norwegian ambassador after a number of Russian citizens were arrested over the use of drones. Nearly a dozen Russians have been arrested in Norway in recent weeks or violating the flight ban or the ban on photographing sites deemed sensitive. The arrests, which Russia has described as “politically motivated” and Norway said were legal, comes as Oslo has heightened security following suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice. A spokesperson for Norway’s foreign ministry, Lars Gjemble, said after the summoning: Our ambassador took the opportunity to inform [Russia] of Norwegian legislation on sanctions. He added: He also reviewed the cases that are currently being processed in Norwegian courts. The meeting was held in a good tone Russia has launched more than 16,000 missile attacks at Ukraine since the war began, 97% of which were civilian targets, according to Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Sienkievych, has said there will be no drinking water supply to the southern Ukrainian city after Russian forces damaged a pumping station in the neighbouring Kherson region. In a post to Telegram, he said: During a missile attack, Russian terrorists damaged a pumping station of MKP Mykolaivvodokanal, located in the Kherson region. Therefore, for an indefinite period of time, we are forced to supply technical water to the city from the Bug estuary. He said the city’s water supply had been repaired just one week after Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops, adding: But we are dealing with real terrorists who are powerless against our military, and therefore they fight with the civilian population. He said repair work continued on networks that were destroyed by salt water. As soon as the security situation allows, we will promptly restore the pumping station and return drinking water to Mykolaiv. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has met Olena Zelenska during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Cleverly tweeted a photo of the pair, and praised Zelenska’s efforts to highlight the “horrific use of sexual violence by Russian forces”. He added: The UK stands with Ukraine, and with all survivors of these despicable crimes. The Ukrainian first lady shared a video of the pair meeting earlier this afternoon, expressing “gratitude” to Cleverly for his support of Ukraine. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, welcomed Zelenska on the pavement outside No 10 Downing Street as the pair exchanged a hug before walking inside the building. Downing Street said Sunak briefly dropped into the meeting between his wife and Zelenska. Zelenska is expected to address MPs and peers tomorrow as part of her visit to London, where she also took part in an international conference on preventing sexual violence during conflicts. At the conference, Zelenska spoke about sexual violence being perpetrated “systematically and openly” as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. She said: Sexual violence is the most cruel, most animalistic way to prove mastership over someone. And for victims of this kind of violence, it is difficult to testify in war times because nobody feels safe. This is another instrument that they’re using as their weaponry. This is another weapon in their arsenal in this war and conflict. Russian servicemen were “very open” about using sexual violence as their weaponry, she said. She added: That’s why it’s extremely important to recognise this as a war crime and to hold all of the perpetrators accountable. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. Speaking to reporters in Bucharest ahead of a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, he said: Doing that when we enter winter demonstrates that President (Vladimir) Putin is now trying to use ... the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. In his Sunday night address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to prepare for a series of new Russian missile strikes on the country. He said: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately.” Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, including reinforcements previously in the Kherson region, the fighting in the Bakhmut sector has descended into trench warfare reminiscent of the first world war. Over the weekend, images emerged of Ukrainian soldiers in flooded, muddy trenches and battlefields dotted with the stumps of trees cut down by withering artillery barrages. Heavy fighting continued on Monday around Soledar, with mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner private military corporation – which includes pardoned convicts – in the forefront. Ukraine’s presidential office said on Monday that at least four civilians had been killed and 11 others wounded in the latest Russian attacks. It said intense fighting was continuing along the frontline in the east, with the Russians shelling Bakhmut and Toretsk at the epicentre of the fighting. “People are sheltering in the basements, many of which are filled by water,” said the governor of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko. They have been living in catastrophic conditions without power or heating. The focus of much of the recent fighting, however, has been the now-shattered town of Bakhmut itself, largely abandoned by its 70,000 residents, with both sides sending reinforcements for a battle that has continued relentlessly since the summer as Moscow has sought to secure a victory after a series of battlefield setbacks and retreats. Read the full story here: It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson.

Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Kremlin has denied the reports. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. The US has put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the jailed basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said. She told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency that Moscow had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Ukraine is bracing for another mass missile attack this week, but in between these major salvos aimed at the power grid, the Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. In a district of small detached houses in Dnipro, the Reva family were sifting through the wreckage of their home today. The house and four others around it had been destroyed by a shell or missile which had landed on Saturday, but the ruins burned right through Sunday and this was the first time they could get close. It was a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, peppering surviving walls with shrapnel and leaving two centimetre diameter holes in metal girders. The bomb fell close to a church and a school, blowing out all its windows, but amazingly no one was killed. Vladyslav Reva does not usually work on a Saturday but had been called out to work by a client of his construction business. “I was saved by God and my client,” he said. His wife, Iryna, had been in the study when the bomb landed and the roof caught fire. She was trying to escape when the blast from their exploding gas heater blew her through a window. She is in hospital with concussion and heavy bruising. The only death was the family dog, a 8 year-old American Akita called June, who has been buried in a corner of the charred garden. Vladyslav Leva showed us a picture of the house before destruction, a handsome two-storey home painted a cheerful yellow and landscaped with a line of trees. His son Oleksii said that it was now past salvaging. “We’re not going to rebuild it,” he said. “We’re going to use a bulldozer and destroy it and then start again somewhere else.” Could the Russian aim of such shelling be to demoralise the population? “Well, they failed,” Oleksii said quickly. “Just the opposite,” his father said, and pointing to the charred ruins of his home, he added: “Better this than Russkiy Mir, Russia’s world.” A US State department spokesperson has confirmed that Russia “unilaterally postponed” talks aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The spokesperson said: The United States and the Russian Federation were set to convene a meeting of the New START Treaty’s Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss New START Treaty implementation on Tuesday, November 29. The Russian side informed the United States that Russia has unilaterally postponed the meeting and stated that it would propose new dates. Washington “is ready to reschedule at the earliest possible date” the meeting “as resuming inspections is a priority for sustaining the treaty as an instrument of stability”, the spokesperson added.

Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador over what it said was the politically motivated arrest of Russian citizens for reportedly using drones illegally. “It was noted that the sentences against the Russians were politically motivated and had nothing to do with the principles of fair and impartial justice,” the ministry said in a statement. Several Russian citizens have reportedly been arrested by Norwegian authorities for flying drones near the Arctic border between the two countries or taking photos of classified facilities, as Norway boosts security after suspected sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Russia has postponed nuclear disarmament talks with the US planned for this week, according to Kommersant newspaper, citing the US embassy. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks between Moscow and Washington in Cairo would no longer take place this week. Russian forces are continuing to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. A 10-year-old boy was injured and hospitalised after Russian shelling on the town of Chornobayivka in Kherson region, police said. Hundreds of Ukrainians are fleeing Kherson city just two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces. Moscow’s shelling has killed at least 32 civilians since its forces left the city on 9 November. In its latest update published last night, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a visit to reaffirm historic ties between the two countries. Tokayev’s visit to the Kremlin today marks his first foreign trip since he secured a second term in a snap election last week. Speaking next to Putin before the talks, Tokayev said: This is my first foreign visit after this event and that in itself has political significance and, of course, a certain symbolism. Russia “is and has always been a strategic partner” to Kazakhstan, he added. Putin said relations between Moscow and Astana had a “special character” and called on a strengthening of economic ties. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden are in Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, tweeted about the visit and vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Finland’s Pekka Haavisto tweeted about the “inconsolability of war” and expressed admiration for the “courage and determination” of Ukrainians as they “defend their independence”. Anniken Huitfeldt, Norway’s foreign minister, also shared photos of her visit to the capital and said her country stood in solidarity with Ukraine. Here’s more from that interview with Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, who discussed the possibility of a follow-up meeting between the CIA’s director, William Burns, and Russian foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin. The pair met in Ankara earlier this month in a rare high-level meeting, following speculation that some senior US figures wanted Ukraine to enter negotiations with the Kremlin to end the war. The US insisted at the time that it was not engaged in secret peace talks with Moscow without Ukrainian officials being present, but that the main purpose of the encounter was to convey “a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia” and to discuss the cases of Americans held in detention in the country. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency, Rood said: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks, and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. I’m sure if there’s a need for another conversation in that channel, it can happen. There’s not anything scheduled that I know of. A senior American diplomat has said the US put forward a “significant” proposal for a deal to free the basketball star Brittney Griner and former marine Paul Whelan, but that Russia had not provided a “serious response” to any of its proposals. Talks between the US and Russia over the two jailed Americans were continuing through the “designated channel”, Elizabeth Rood, the chargée d’affaires of the US mission to Russia, told Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency. She said: The United States, as we have said, has put a significant proposal on the table. We have followed up on that proposal and we have proposed alternatives. Unfortunately, so far the Russian Federation has not provided a serious response to those proposals. Griner was sentenced in August to nine years in a penal colony after being convicted on drug charges. Her lawyers have confirmed that she was taken earlier this month to a penal colony in the Russian region of Mordovia, the same region where Whelan is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted of espionage charges that he denies. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow hoped to complete a prisoner swap with the US to return the convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in an exchange that would probably include Griner. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. In a statement posted to Telegram, it said: Data on affected children as of November 28, 2022: 329 are missing, 12,034 – deported, and 7,819 – found. It emphasised that the figures were not final as work was still under way to verify reports coming from the frontline, as well as from occupied and liberated parts of Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. The prosecutor general’s office reports a total of 1,291 children casualties, with the largest number in regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv. It is not possible to independently verify these figures. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine.

People walk past a destroyed Russian billboard yesterday in Kherson, Ukraine. In case you missed it, hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” A BM-21 ‘Grad’ multiple rocket launcher fires towards Russian positions on the frontline near Bakhmut, Donetsk region. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television on Sunday: In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant]. One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” The Russian backed administration issued a statement in response on the Telegram messaging app on Monday, saying: The media are actively spreading fakes that Russia is allegedly planning to withdraw from Enerhodar and leave the [nuclear plant]. This information is not true.” The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing’s proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America’s eastern European allies, industry sources told the news agency. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories. Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly. Although the US has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range Atacms missile, the GLSDB’s 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas. GLSDB is made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation”. In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: “We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.” According to the document – a Boeing proposal to US European – has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3ft in diameter. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. A video on RIA’s Telegram channel cited Rood as saying: The United States has channels for managing risk with the Russian Federation, particularly nuclear risks and that was the purpose of CIA director Burns’ meeting with his Russian counterpart. Director Burns did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.” Rood refers to a meeting CIA director William Burns has with Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russian foreign intelligence, earlier this month where he warned him about the consequences of any Russian use of nuclear weapons. Russia said the issues discussed were “sensitive” and declined to comment on them. Rood said if there is need for another conversation in that channel it can happen. “There is not anything scheduled that I know of.” Russia said after Naryshkin’s meeting with Burns that Moscow was open to more high-level talks with the US, but the Kremlin dismissed the idea of a summit between President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden as “out of the question” for now. Officials from the two countries were set to meet in the Egyptian capital of Cairo from 29 November to 6 December to discuss resuming inspections under the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, although Moscow has played down the prospect of a quick breakthrough. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address: We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure.

Only Navalny’s lawyers were allowed to visit his prison colony on weekdays, and even then, Volkov said, “they are not allowed to see him; they only can talk to him through an opaque glass”, meaning they cannot determine his physical condition.",

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. With the Kremlin sending fresh reinforcements to the area, as well as troops previously deployed in the south, the Russian armed forces and the Wagner mercenary group have begun intensifying efforts to break that long and bloody stalemate, with unconfirmed reports of the use of incendiary munitions against Ukrainian positions. Russia has been pounding Ukraine’s power grid and other infrastructure from the air, causing widespread blackouts and leaving millions of Ukrainians without heat, power or water as frigid cold and snow blankets the capital, Kyiv, and other cities. Four-hour or longer power outages were expected in 15 Ukrainian regions on Monday, according to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of the state grid operator, Ukrenergo. More than 40% of Ukraine’s energy facilities were damaged by Russian missile strikes in recent weeks. While the situation in the recently liberated areas of the south led to the evacuations announcement, it is barely better in many other parts of the country. The situation in Kyiv and other major cities has deteriorated drastically after the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrenergo said 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties because of damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across Ukraine. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, it added: “Resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has also stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout. “Worst-case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we [do not] have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” he said on Friday. Ukrenergo said: “Thousands of kilometres of key high-voltage lines are not working,” affecting the entire country. News of the evacuations came as a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had caused widespread damage, but concluded that there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns at the Russian-held facility. “They were able to confirm that – despite the severity of the shelling – key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,” the UN agency said in a statement. Repeated shelling of the Zaporizhzhia complex has raised concerns about a grave accident 310 miles (500km) from the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing uranium-235. The reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Heavy fighting continues in Kherson city, where there were a series of explosions on Monday, with one person killed and four others were taken to hospital as a result of shelling, according to the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Russia’s forces continue to strengthen defences along the east bank of the Dnipro River and to build up additional defensive lines deep inside Russian-held territory. “Artillery duels continue, the fight continues,” said Dmytro Pletentchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military in the area. “Kherson is now on the frontline.”",

                    "body": "<p>The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings.</p> <p>Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021.</p> <p>In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened.</p> <p>Graham wants Ofgem, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/13/too-slow-to-act-ofgem-failures-cost-energy-consumers-billions-say-mps\">has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis</a>, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said.</p> <p>Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors.</p> <p>The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators#:~:text=Autumn%20statement%202022%3A%20key%20points%20at%20a%20glance&amp;text=The%20chancellor%20also%20confirmed%20that,two%20years%2C%20until%20March%202028.\">introduced a levy</a> on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants.</p> <p>However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising.</p> <p>Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them.</p> <p>In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said.</p> <p>The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis.</p> <p>In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation.</p> <p>As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years.</p> <p>The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price.</p> <p>In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m).</p> <p>In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said.</p> <p>Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said.",

Advocates of such a move argued that the risks of such a step triggering an all-out war are far lower now than at the start of the full-scale invasion, as Russian forces are currently confined to the far east and south of the country. However, there would be considerable resistance to any such expansion of Nato’s role from the US and other Nato allies.</p> <p>Even though this incident is likely to be contained, it does not mean that risks of a Nato-Russian clash through miscalculation are not real.

The Soviet Union and the US managed to get through the whole cold war without making such a mistake, because Washington and Moscow were well aware of the risks of going to war by accident or miscalculation. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a far less predictable nuclear power than the Soviet Union, raising the danger level, as Joe Biden has pointed out, to the highest since the Cuban missile crisis. Putin’s intervention in Syria led to a Russian warplane being shot down by a Turkish fighter jet over the Turkish-Syrian border in November 2015, but that incident was contained.

Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an “armed attack” envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. “‘Deliberate armed attack’ is a real thing,” Alberque said. “Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles ain’t it.” Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that – rather than any form of direct Nato involvement – would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. The Polish border incident has also restored calls for a no-fly zone over western Ukraine enforced by Nato air defences, in particular from Baltic state officials. Advocates of such a move argued that the risks of such a step triggering an all-out war are far lower now than at the start of the full-scale invasion, as Russian forces are currently confined to the far east and south of the country. However, there would be considerable resistance to any such expansion of Nato’s role from the US and other Nato allies. Even though this incident is likely to be contained, it does not mean that risks of a Nato-Russian clash through miscalculation are not real. Kyiv is anxious to bind Nato as closely as possible to the country’s struggle to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the missiles were a “a strike against our collective security” and a “very serious escalation”. Meanwhile, as the Russian military debacle in Ukraine worsens with the loss of Kherson and surrounding territory, Putin is becoming more desperate and the ultra-hawks who dominate television discourse in Russia are baying for a confrontation to rationalise the humiliation of losing a war to Ukraine. While the defence ministry claimed not to have anything to do with the missiles, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT propaganda channel, gloated over the implications of a Russian strike. “If this isn’t a deliberate provocation, there’s one piece of good news here,” Simonyan said on Twitter. “A Nato country is so shitily defended that anyone can accidentally hit it with anything and all of Nato won’t even know who hit it, with what and why.”",

And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones?</p> <p>Here’s what to know:</p> <h2>What are the concerns about TikTok?</h2> <p>Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government.</p> <p>A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects.</p> <p>Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation.</p> <p>“This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/fbi-chief-says-tiktok-screams-us-national-security-concerns-2023-03-08/\">Wray said</a>.</p> <h2>How is the US responding?</h2> <p>The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment.</p> <p>Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.”</p> <p>In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns.</p> <p>In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies.</p> <p>At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support.</p> <h2>How has TikTok already been restricted?</h2> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-tiktok-government-ban-470538b4030cf6213dc655da45188023\">British authorities said they were banning TikTok</a> on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones.</p> <p>Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices.</p> <h2>What does TikTok say?</h2> <p>A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”.</p> <p>In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur.</p> <p>The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive.</p> <p>After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others.</p> <p>Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas.</p> <h2>Are the security risks legitimate?</h2> <p>It depends on whom you ask.</p> <p>Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information.</p> <p>“If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future.</p> <p>Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles.</p> <p>Others say there is legitimate reason for concern.</p> <p>People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said.</p> <h2>Is there precedent for banning tech companies?</h2> <p>Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web.</p> <p>Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.</p>",

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US – part of the treasury department – was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake. So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones? Here’s what to know: What are the concerns about TikTok? Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government. A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects. Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation. “This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” Wray said. How is the US responding? The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment. Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.” In 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns. In Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies. At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support. How has TikTok already been restricted? On Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones. Last month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices. What does TikTok say? A TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”. In June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur. The TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive. After convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”. Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others. Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas. Are the security risks legitimate? It depends on whom you ask. Some tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information. “If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future. Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles. Others say there is legitimate reason for concern. People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said. Is there precedent for banning tech companies? Last year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web. Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.",

                    "body": "<p>“It’s like entering a lottery: you know something’s coming your way, but you’ve got no idea exactly what,” says one chief executive of a large UK electricity generator about the looming windfall tax on his sector. It’s a fair comment. Government thinking on the generators – as opposed to the North Sea oil and gas producers, who already have a levy – has been spinning like a wind turbine for six months.</p> <p>Back in May, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">“urgently evaluating”</a> the scale of excess profits being made by generators on the entirely sensible grounds that not all windfall profits have been made by firms producing dirty hydrocarbons. Nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar farms, hydro projects and biomass burners may also be doing very nicely thanks to a UK energy system that ties the price of electricity to the price of gas.</p> <p>But Sunak conceded defeat in the face of complexity. Power is contractually sold forward; hedges complicate matters; the windfall component is hard to isolate. But never mind, Kwasi Kwarteng, then business secretary, was soon looking at a voluntary negotiation with generators to lower the price of energy.</p> <p>Those on old-style (and often lucrative) “renewables obligations” incentives would be switched to newer “contracts-for-difference” where windfall returns don’t arise because revenues over a set price flow to the Treasury. With Kwarteng as chancellor, and Liz Truss as PM, the plan seemed to be set. Soon, though, it morphed into a revenue cap – modelled on the European Union’s version – because negotiations with companies stalled.</p> <p>Then we arrived at the Sunak-Jeremy Hunt combo in Downing Street, and it seems we’re back to something closer to Sunak’s original thought: a conventional windfall tax.

                    "bodyText": "“It’s like entering a lottery: you know something’s coming your way, but you’ve got no idea exactly what,” says one chief executive of a large UK electricity generator about the looming windfall tax on his sector. It’s a fair comment. Government thinking on the generators – as opposed to the North Sea oil and gas producers, who already have a levy – has been spinning like a wind turbine for six months. Back in May, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was “urgently evaluating” the scale of excess profits being made by generators on the entirely sensible grounds that not all windfall profits have been made by firms producing dirty hydrocarbons. Nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar farms, hydro projects and biomass burners may also be doing very nicely thanks to a UK energy system that ties the price of electricity to the price of gas. But Sunak conceded defeat in the face of complexity. Power is contractually sold forward; hedges complicate matters; the windfall component is hard to isolate. But never mind, Kwasi Kwarteng, then business secretary, was soon looking at a voluntary negotiation with generators to lower the price of energy. Those on old-style (and often lucrative) “renewables obligations” incentives would be switched to newer “contracts-for-difference” where windfall returns don’t arise because revenues over a set price flow to the Treasury. With Kwarteng as chancellor, and Liz Truss as PM, the plan seemed to be set. Soon, though, it morphed into a revenue cap – modelled on the European Union’s version – because negotiations with companies stalled. Then we arrived at the Sunak-Jeremy Hunt combo in Downing Street, and it seems we’re back to something closer to Sunak’s original thought: a conventional windfall tax. That, at least, is the prediction for Thursday’s autumn statement. Alongside an increase in the levy on North Sea firms, the chancellor is expected to introduce a charge of 40%-45% on generators’ “excess returns”. All clear now? Well, it depends on whether “excess” has been defined. Is the EU’s threshold of €180 a megawatt hour for its revenue cap the right level to use in the UK to judge a fair return? Probably not: the EU seemed to be guided by the marginal cost of coal generation, which has been virtually phased out in the UK. And – to pick on one fraught debate – are gas-fired power stations a suitable target for a windfall charge? Attention has mostly focused on nuclear and renewables generators on old-style “renewables obligations” certificates, but the gas-fired crew have also been having a nice crisis, as SSE half-year numbers on Wednesday demonstrated. Should gas-fired stations get softer treatment because their crucial “flexible” capacity has been maintained during rotten years for profits? That was the gist on the argument from SSE’s chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies. But one could equally argue it would be perverse to tax renewables (SSE’s prime investment focus) while leaving gas untouched if the government is also trying to accelerate a green transition. Therein lie a few complexities in designing a windfall tax on generators. It ain’t straightforward. The point, though, is that it’s time to make choices – and not boot the detail into another round of consultation, negotiation and lobbying. Delay and uncertainty also impact companies’ investment decisions and the government has been round the houses with the generators for half a year. Hunt must arrive with a plan, as opposed to an intention. Property investors racked with gilts If investors in gilts have been surprised by how much volatility can be generated by rising interest rates and a reckless mini-budget, think of poor investors in property investment trusts.

At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country.",

Slobodan Milosevic identified the birthplace of Serbian nationalism, indeed the Serbian nation, in Kosovo Poljie, and he inspired his people with this misbegotten idea that it needed to be rescued and liberated. <strong>There’s a very close sort of analogy between that catastrophic mistake, and what the president of Russia has been saying about Kyiv and the origins of Russian religion and culture and civilization and his objectives in Ukraine.</strong> When it comes to the International Criminal Court, that’s a matter for them. There would have to be the gathering of evidence.

The design is a lot different to the Chernobyl reactor, which did not have a containment building, and hence there is no real risk, in my opinion, at the plant now the reactors have been safely shut down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Prof Tom Scott, at the University of Bristol, UK said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Shelling nuclear power plants is against the Geneva conventions and this is obviously very worrying. The good news is that radiation levels around the plant are reportedly normal and five of the six reactors are now turned off, with one still operating.</p> \n   <p>The reactors are all pressurised water reactors and hence don’t have graphite cores which could set on fire as per Chernobyl. Their inherent safety design should mean they are naturally quite resilient to any external perturbations and hence I am not overly concerned that inadvertent damage could cause a major nuclear incident.</p> \n   <p>However, it would be more concerning if the reactors were being deliberately targeted to induce a nuclear incident.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T11:17:56.476Z\">at 11.17am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6221dcc68f088d6b798dcac9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T09:34:24.423Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ahead of a busy day of diplomacy in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war.</strong></p> \n  <p>He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We condemn the attacks on civilians and overnight we have also seen the reports about the attacks against a nuclear power plant. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">This just shows the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it.</span></p> \n   <p>And the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cd7076fd4fdca5f9be46dbb709e9ac8d2178c8c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cd7076fd4fdca5f9be46dbb709e9ac8d2178c8c/0_48_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during a joint news conference before a NATO foreign ministers meeting amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at the Alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, 04 March 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nato secretary gneral Jens Stoltenberg during a joint news conference before a foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>British foreign secretary Liz Truss is in Brussels for a meeting of Nato ministers and later she will join EU foreign ministers who are also hosting Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, Canada’s foreign minister Mélanie Joly and Stoltenberg.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T11:18:50.852Z\">at 11.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6221da668f08c1dd5f65ae2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T09:26:47.421Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry has sought to blame an attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Ukrainian saboteurs.</strong></p> \n  <p>Ukraine said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, in an incident that provoked international condemnation of Moscow, a week into its invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the nuclear plant was operating normally and the area had been under Russian control since 28 February, Reuters reported.</p> \n  <p>“However, last night on the territory adjacent to the power plant, an attempt was made by the Kyiv nationalist regime to carry out a monstrous provocation,” spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c95a35ee4ba9b22940244a816f8496f86a867aae\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95a35ee4ba9b22940244a816f8496f86a867aae/0_70_2094_1256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite image from gGogle showing the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satellite image from Google showing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google Earth</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>“Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible?

Singapore has outlined details of the financial measures it will impose on Russia, after it announced on Monday that it would take the rare step of imposing sanctions. In a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: We will impose financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government. Digital payment token service providers are specifically prohibited from facilitating transactions that could help to circumvent these financial measures. These measures apply to all financial institutions in Singapore, including banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets intermediaries, securities exchanges and payment service providers. The statement describes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a gross violation of international law”. It is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose sanctions. Full details of the measures are on the ministry website. The Washington Post’s media reporter says the paper will no longer include staff names on stories produced by reporters in Russia, to protect their safety. This is in response to a new law imposed in Russia that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. The law has prompted several global news organisations to suspend reporting in the country, including the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Bloomberg News. CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia. The port city Mariupol has been “blockaded” by Russian forces, according to its mayor, AFP reports. Mayor Vadym Boychenko has perviously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has asked for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe evacuation of some of the city’s 400,000 residents. If Russia were to control the city, this would help it to build a land corridor between Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. In a message posted to the mayor’s Telegram account, he said: For now, we are looking for solutions to humanitarian problems and all possible ways to get Mariupol out of the blockade... Our priority is the establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city. Here are images from across Ukraine’s towns and cities, taken on Friday. More than 1.2 million people have fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February. The UN Refugee Agency believes a similar number are displaced but remain within the country’s borders. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN has said that Russian forces are now “20 miles and closing from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility”, warning that imminent danger continues. “We narrowly avoided a disaster last night,” she said, referring to Russia’s recent attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, about 140 miles (225 km) west of Mariupol. “The international community must be unanimous in demanding Russia’s forces stop their dangerous assaul,” she said. Samsung has become the latest company to suspend shipments to Russia, Bloomberg reports. In a statement, the company said: “Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted and our priority is to ensure the safety of all our employees and their families.” The company is also donating $6 million, including $1 million in consumer electronics products, to humanitarian efforts in the region, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft has also suspended all sales and services to Russia, while Apple has suspended sales of iPhones, and restricted other services. A Sky News crew has been evacuated back to the UK from Ukraine after journalists were shot during an ambush by a suspected Russian “death squad”. The team of five were attacked while out in a car, after unsuccessfully trying to visit the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Chief correspondent with Sky News, Stuart Ramsay, along with camera operator Richie Mockler were shot – Ramsay in the lower back while Mockler took two rounds in his body armour. Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from my colleague Dani. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time. The call has been requested by Zelenskiy. Here is AFP’s report As the war in Ukraine intensifies, some US lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to take a tougher stance against Russia, such as by suspending imports of its oil. The White House has ruled this out so far, fearing it might cause rising oil prices to go up even more and hurt US consumers stung by record inflation. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has called for “somebody in Russia” to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky himself is strongly urging NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to halt bombing raids but the Biden administration has ruled this out, fearing it might lead to an all-out war between the West and Russia, although some US lawmakers support the creation of such a zone. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has critisized Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional nighttime address. Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.” Zelenskiy said Nato countries have created a narrative that a no-fly zone would provoke Russia’s aggression against Nato. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have,” he said. He also praised Ukrainians for their resistance against Russia’s invasion: “We are warriors of light,” he said. “The history of Europe will remember this forever.” The war in Ukraine is shaking markets, slowing economic growth and sending European stocks sinking. From Reuters: Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions. The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine. European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is assisting in the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The Met is tasked with carrying out “any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”, it said Friday, and is “appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes”. “Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may themselves have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine at any time from 21 November 2013 onwards,” the Met said. Investigators are seeking out people who have a direct link to relevant information, rather than the general public submitting social media posts or media reports. “This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine. Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK,” said Richard Smith, the head of the Met’s counter terrorism command. Several leading luxury brands, including Hermes, the Cartier owner Richemont, LVMH, Kering and Chanel, announced they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. “Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia,” the French luxury fashion house said in a post on LinkedIn. More from Reuters: Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country, a spokesperson told Reuters. French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support. While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry’s main growth engines, China and the United States. Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion. Senior US military leaders haven’t spoken with their Russian counterparts since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, officials said Friday. From Reuters: Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley had not spoken with their counterparts. Prior to Russia’s invasion, both Austin and Milley had spoken with their counterparts. A 43-year-old father and resident of Kyiv spoke to the Guardian about how life has changed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began a week ago. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. More of Mike’s first-person account from Jem Bartholomew: CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia. A spokesperson for the news channel said on Friday it would cease broadcasting “while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,” Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it would temporarily suspend the work of its journalists inside Russia in response to a new law passed by Putin the outlet says “criminalises independent reporting in the country”. “We have with great regret decided to temporarily suspend our news gathering inside Russia,” John Micklethwait, the Bloomberg editor-in-chief, said. “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country.” The BBC announced earlier today it would temporarily halt its news operation in Russia due to the new law, as has the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Journalists with Sky News were violently ambushed in Ukraine on Monday as they attempted to return to Kyiv. Harrowing footage published by the outlet on Friday shows an explosion and then a barrage of bullets hitting the team’s vehicle before they flee into a nearby warehouse. Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated. We didn’t know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn’t miss ... We knew we had to get out to survive, but the incoming fire was intense. One journalist took two rounds to his body armour, and another was wounded. The team has since returned to the UK. Read correspondent Stuart Ramsay’s full account here Canada’s Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) said today that they will be temporarily suspending reporting from Russia, citing a new law passed by Putin today where those intentionally spreading “fake” news could face jail time. Here’s the statement published by CBC on the matter: CBC/Radio-Canada is very concerned about new legislation passed in Russia, which appears to criminalize independent reporting on the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. In light of this situation and out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia, we have temporarily suspended our reporting from the ground in Russia while we get clarity on this legislation. We join other media in standing up for a free press and unimpeded access to accurate, independent journalism in Ukraine and Russia. Our journalists have been doing vital work to bring all elements of this story to Canadians and people around the world. We are proud of their professionalism and determination and we will continue to support their work. Italian police have seized a yacht owned by Alexey Mordashov, once the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union, said a source familiar with the matter to Reuters. The 215ft yacht, “Lady M,” was sequestered in the northern Italian port of Imperia, confirmed the source. A second yacht owned by billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who also has close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, is being blocked in Imperia and will be impounded shortly, the source added. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III posted a statement to Twitter summarizing his recent talks with Polish defense minister Mariusz Błaszczak about Russia’s war on Ukraine: I spoke today with Polish Defense Minister [Mariusz Błaszczak] on our collective efforts to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense and to support Ukraine. I commend Poland’s extraordinary efforts, along with those of other Allies and partners, to help the Ukrainian people. #WeAreNATO Russia is not cooperating on proposed humanitarian corridors in Kherson, says Ukrainian officials, reports the Washington Post’s David Stern, Adela Suliman, and Adam Taylor: Local officials in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson said Friday that Russia is not living up to its side of the bargain on proposed “humanitarian corridors,” even as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle in the region. Leaders from Ukraine and Russia announced Thursday they had agreed to temporary cease-fires to support “humanitarian corridors” for civilians to be evacuated and so food and medicine could be delivered. But local Ukrainian officials in the Kherson region say that the Russian military is not working with them and is instead pushing a plan to distribute its own aid unilaterally. Regional governor Gennady Laguta wrote on Facebook on Friday that the “occupiers” had not given the go-ahead to send humanitarian aid to the Kherson region through the proposed corridor. Laguta said that Ukrainian authorities had readied 19 trucks, but they were not yet being allowed to go in. The Russians “say that they will provide humanitarian aid themselves,” Laguta wrote. In his own message to Facebook, Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaev said that the agreement was not helping the city. “Despite yesterday’s agreements at the highest level, in practice,” Kolykhaev wrote, “all this is not yet working.” “But, judging by everything, ‘good liberators’ are preparing to bring their ‘rescue’ to Kherson. First they brought the situation to a critical point, and then heroically they will save us,” Kolykhaev wrote, referring to Russia. Read the full article here (paywall). British prime minister Boris Johnson said in an interview today that he saw a “close analogy” between Russian president Vladimir Putin and late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who was charged with war crimes, reports Agence France-Presse. Here are Johnson’s full comments from an interview he did with El País: [Interview question]: You said in the House of Commons that Putin is a war criminal. Should the West aspire to put this war criminal in front of an International court, like Milosevic or the Nuremberg trial? [Johnson’s answer] What I certainly believe is that there is a close analogy between Putin’s behavior and the last years of Slobodan Milosevic. It’s very interesting that both leaders had been in power for a long time, both increasingly autocratic, both seeking to shore up their domestic position, and found a great nationalist cause. Slobodan Milosevic identified the birthplace of Serbian nationalism, indeed the Serbian nation, in Kosovo Poljie, and he inspired his people with this misbegotten idea that it needed to be rescued and liberated. There’s a very close sort of analogy between that catastrophic mistake, and what the president of Russia has been saying about Kyiv and the origins of Russian religion and culture and civilization and his objectives in Ukraine. When it comes to the International Criminal Court, that’s a matter for them. There would have to be the gathering of evidence. If there is evidence of the use of illegal munitions, cluster bombs, barrel weapons, this clearly will have to be brought to the Netherlands. Read the full interview here. Poland has arrested a Spanish journalist on suspicion of being a Russian spy who was planning to “go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” Internal Security Agency (ABW) said on Friday. The suspect, identified as an “agent of Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU)”, is currently detained in Przemysl - near Poland’s border with Ukraine on Sunday night, ABW said in a statement. The note released by the Police said he was of Russian origin. ABW said the man carried out operations to benefit Russia and travelled in Europe and elsewhere under the cover of being a journalist. His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Reuters he had not yet been able to contact his client. He tweeted earlier that his client had been charged with espionage and was being held in Rzeszow prison. Spain’s foreign ministry said it had been informed by Polish authorities of the charges but could not provide any details. It said it would offer consular assistance. “Before his detention, he was planning to go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” said Spain’s foreign ministry. More on Russia’s ongoing online censorship: following a ban on Twitter in Russia, Youtube also appears to be blocked throughout the country. From NEXTA news: Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted access to Twitter, confirmed Tass news agency today. Experts are weighing in on the recent ban that is sending the country into almost complete online isolation as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues. From CNN’s Senior Global Affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga: And there goes Twitter in Russia. The country has been disconnected from the world. In one week a nation of 145m- hermetically sealed. With barely any objection from Putin’s Duma. They approved his “special operation” in Ukraine and his massive repression and censorship at home. From ABC foreign correspondant James Longman: I’m still able to access Facebook and Twitter in Russia. It may take time for code to trickle through, I don’t know. But for now full access. Announcing a ban on something is one thing, making sure it happens is another. Earlier today, Russia also blocked Facebook across the country, another example of online censorship that was met with stark criticism from Western countries. “We are deeply concerned about this and concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This just in: Russia has banned Twitter throughout the country, according to Interfax news agency. This story is developing- more details to come. Putin signed a bill into law today that introduces jail terms of up to 15 years for people publishing “fake news” about the Russian army as Russia moves forward with its invasion of Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse. The bill, which was adopted by lawmakers earlier on Friday, sets out jail terms of varying lengths and fines against people who publish “knowingly false information” about the military, with harsher penalties to hit when dissemination is deemed to have serious consequences. Putin also signed a bill that would allow fines or jail terms of up to three years for calling for sanctions against Russia with Moscow facing harsh economic penalties from Western capitals over the invasion. The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on independent and critical voices in Russia that only intensified after the start of the invasion. Russia’s media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to the BBC and other independent media websites and blocked social media giant Facebook. Two news outlets said they will stop reporting on Ukraine to protect their journalists, while the BBC announced a halt of its operations in Russia. Russian media have been instructed to only publish information provided by official sources, which describe the invasion as a military operation. State-controlled broadcasters have meanwhile reinforced government narratives about nationalism in Ukraine and Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian soldiers are using civilians as human shields. The US is currently weighing options if it decides to cut consumption of Russian energy, said the White House. From Reuters: The Biden administration is looking at options if it were to decide to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy, White House economic adviser Cecilia Rouse said on Friday, adding that the United States does not import much Russian oil. “What’s really most important is that we maintain (a) steady supply of global energy,” Rouse told reporters at a White House news briefing, adding that the administration was “considering a range of options that we could take right now” if needed. It is 9:20 pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack. An emergency of the UN security council was summoned following the attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the world narrowly averted a “nuclear catastrophe” and condemned Russia’s actions as “reckless” and “dangerous”. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. He called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. Russia’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The UN human rights council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss posted a statement to Twitter following an announcement today that the UK will be bolstering sanctions against Russia. From foreign secretary Liz Truss: We have shown Putin that his invasion has consequences. In addition to one of the world’s biggest sanctions packages against Russia, we are ratcheting up pressure by introducing emergency legislation to go faster and harder on Putin’s enablers. They will have nowhere to hide. Compared to other countries and the EU, the UK has sanctioned the second-lowest number of entities since the Russian invasion, according to a visual by Bloomberg: The UK is “bolstering” its package of sanctions against the Kremlin with “new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster”, Boris Johnson said. The UK prime minister said the changes will “ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil”, ensuring they have “nowhere to hide”, PA news agency reports. The amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill will “help streamline the current legislation so we can respond even more swiftly and effectively to the current crisis in the way we sanction individuals”, the Foreign Office said. The FCDO said the provisions will allow the UK to align more rapidly with the individual designations imposed by allies such as the US, Canada and the EU. The changes also include shortening the length of time foreign owners of UK property will be given to declare their true identity under a new register of overseas entities, from 18 months to six months. Criminal penalties for non-compliance are set to increase from fines of up to 500 per day to up to 2,500 per day under a further amendment. About 100 people could still be trapped under rubble after a missile attack hit a large apartment block in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. A spokesperson for the service told CNN that “about 100 people may be trapped under the rubble” in Borodyanka after the attack on Thursday but “it is impossible to give a more precise figure at the moment.” Rescuers do not have access to these people due to the constant shelling. We are ready to evacuate people as soon as there is an agreement on a ‘green corridor. Thousands of people living in the area near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine are unable to evacuate because of ongoing shelling by Russian forces, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of lying about its takeover of the country’s biggest nuclear power plant. Russia’s defence ministry has blamed the overnight attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Its account has directly contradicted Ukraine’s version of events. Ukraine has said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire. G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement saying Russia would face further “severe sanctions” for its invasion of Ukraine, Daniel Boffey writes. We will continue to impose further severe sanctions in response to Russian aggression, enabled by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus. We urge Russia to stop its attacks especially in the direct vicinity of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Speaking in Brussels following a meeting of western foreign ministers, Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said they had been given an update via videolink by Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. They are shelling residential housing, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructures, Borrell told reporters: It looks like they want to destroy Ukraine. Russia’s state regulator Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. Russian state-owned news agency Ria said the country’s media watchdog had decided to block access to the social media platform. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020 International students trapped in a Ukrainian town near the Russian border have made desperate appeals for evacuation, as the number thought to be stranded in Sumy has risen to between 1,200 and 1,500, Lisa O’Carroll and Emmanuel Akinwotu report. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, saying they were running out of food and water. Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure. Earlier this week, it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Aashik Hussain Sarkar, an Indian medical student, said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday: Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting. One student told the Indian network NDTV they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border. The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe overnight when a fire broke out during a Russian seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the US ambassador to the United Nations said. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia’s actions were “reckless” and “dangerous”. By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night. We all waited to exhale as we watched the horrific situation unfold in real time. The attack overnight reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she said, warning that “imminent danger” persisted, citing Russian troops whom she said were 20 miles from Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear facility. Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe. She demanded assurances from Moscow that such an assault will not happen again. Microsoft has joined Apple in suspending product sales in Russia, Dan Milmo reports. The US tech firm provides the software behind more than a billion devices worldwide, as well as providing cloud computing services and being a major player in gaming through the Xbox. Microsoft said it would “suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services” in Russia, but declined to elaborate on how the policy would be applied. Like the rest of the world, we are horrified, angered and saddened by the images and news coming from the war in Ukraine and condemn this unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion by Russia, Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a blog post. On Tuesday Apple said it halted sales of its products in Russia, while social media companies including Facebook owner Meta have blocked Russian state-owned media services across Europe. Microsoft also said it has also taken action over harmful cyberattacks against the Ukrainian state. Since the war began, we have acted against Russian positioning, destructive or disruptive measures against more than 20 Ukrainian government, IT and financial sector organizations, Smith’s blog said. A video filmed in the Ukrainian town shows crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Residents say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war have damaged or destroyed nearly every building in Volnovakha. The US state department has reportedly urged US embassies in Europe not to share a tweet posted by the US embassy in Kyiv calling the attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant by Russia a war crime, CNN reports. Earlier today the US embassy in Kyiv said attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm. CNN has reviewed an “urgent” message from the US state department to all US embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the US Embassy Kyiv’s tweet. All – do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime. If you have retweeted it – un-retweet it ASAP. The message is an indication that the US government may not be endorsing the war crime allegation made by the embassy, the news channel writes. Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police have said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov shared a photo of Markhalivka, where he claimed three children had died as a result of a Russian attack. Here’s more on the impact of new Russian legislation that could jail anyone found to be intentionally spreading “fake” news. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website because of censorship. The newspaper, whose editor Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel peace prize, said it would remove all of its war coverage due to the threat of criminal prosecution its journalists and readers could face. In a statement, Novaya Gazeta would continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing, including a deepening economic crisis and the persecution of dissidents. Military censorship in Russia has quickly moved into a new phase: from the threat of blocking and closing publications (almost fully implemented) it has moved to the threat of criminal prosecution of both journalists and citizens who spread information about military hostilities that is different from the press releases of the Ministry of Defense. There is no doubt that this threat will be realised. The newspaper said it could not risk the freedom of its staff but also could not ignore its readers’ desire for it to continue working, even under military censorship. It would therefore remove materials “on this topic” from its website and social networks. We continue to report on the consequences that Russia is facing: the developing economic crisis, the rapid decline in living standards, problems with access to foreign medicines and technologies, and the persecution of dissidents, including for anti-war statements. The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia after Russian authorities passed new legislation making the spread of “fake” information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. On Friday, Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. They also imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia. Russian officials have repeatedly accused the west of spreading false information in an attempt to sow discord among the Russin people. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. He continued: The safety of staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. For more detail and reaction to this you can follow our UK live blog: Footage shared on social media shows the aftermath of a Russian strike in the city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv. A large block of flats is seen with severe structural damage and windows blown out, and people are heard screaming. Russian forces were driven out of the Ukrainian city of Mykolayiv after attacking it on Friday, regional authorities said. Some fighting continued around the outskirts of the Black Sea port city, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. It comes after the governor said Russian troops had entered Mykolayiv for the first time this morning. “Let’s not get nervous,” he said in a video statement shared online. The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. Vadym Boychenko, mayor of Mariupol, said called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city. We are simply being destroyed. Earlier this afternoon, a senior US official told reporters that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control, though Russian troops are continuing to advance and bombard the city, causing utility outages. The US is committed to doing everything needed to stop the war in Ukraine, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. Blinken praised the EU for “historic” steps it has taken against Russia: We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop. Standing alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, Blinken added: We’re committed to doing everything we can to make it stop. So the coordination between us is vital. The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia’s ministry of defence to prevent “miscalculation, military incidents and escalation” in the region as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine advances, a US official told Reuters on Thursday. The US says it has no troops in Ukraine but it and Nato allies in Europe are worried about potential spillover, including accidents, as Russia stages the largest assault on a European state since the second world war. The US and its allies are also channeling millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to Ukraine’s armed forces, which are using the arms against Russian troops, despite Moscow’s warnings against foreign interference. “The Department of the Defence recently established a de-confliction line with the Russian ministry of defence on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation,” a senior US defence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirming a move first reported by NBC. International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons gave one of the most political speeches at an Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony for decades, as he opened the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics saying: “I want – I must – begin with a message of peace as the leader of our organisation. I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate.” Throwing away decades of tradition of only making guarded comments at such events, Parsons continued: “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated. At the IPC we aspire to a better and more inclusive growth, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance, and free from conflict.” He finished his speech by almost bellowing the word “Peace”. In 2014 in Sochi, the Ukrainian Winter Paralympics team had staged a symbolic protest, sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony to represent them as Russian troops invaded the Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, with their country again under attack from Russia, the scene was very different. Maksym Yarovyi carried in his nation’s flag ahead of a full delegation, whose arrival in China had been fraught, while the Russian delegation announced that they would be leaving China rather than filing an immediate legal appeal over their expulsion. Microsoft said on Friday it was suspending new sales of its products and services in Russia, becoming the latest major Western company to distance itself from Moscow after the country’s invasion A string of Western companies, including Nike, Apple, H&amp;M and Ikea had already severed relations with Russia as Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its 8th day. In a statement published on Thursday, Ikea said their decisions to suspend operations will “have a direct impact on 15,000 IKEA co-workers” in Russia. In addition to suspending new sales, Microsoft said it was also stopping many aspects of its business in Russia in compliance with US sanctions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions that followed in response have led to dire predictions about the Russian economy. The US bank JPMorgan on Thursday forecasted that the country will face a 35% contraction in the second quarter, as the Russian rouble slumped to new record lows against the dollar. The US Embassy in Ukraine said that attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime after Russia seized a Ukrainian nuclear facility, the biggest in Europe. “It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” US Embassy Kyiv said in its post. Russian forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a huge blaze in a training building has been extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe. Russia’s defence ministry spuriously blamed a fire at the plant on a “monstrous attack” by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control, Reuters reported. The European Union wants Ukraine to become a member state “as soon as possible”, commissioner Maros Sefcovic told journalists on Friday after a ministers’ meeting. “It’s time for signalling that the Ukrainian people is one of the European peoples and we want them in as soon as possible”, he said, but added that at the moment the bloc needed to focus on short-term measures linked to the war. “I think what (...) is the most important now is to help Ukraine in the fight”, he added. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians have been killed and 675 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll was likely much higher. The toll, up until midnight on Thursday, rose from 249 in its previous report from a day earlier, Reuters reported. Among the 331 killed were 19 children, the UN said. Most of the victims were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and missile and air strikes, according to the rights office, which has monitors in Ukraine. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 11:30am ET (4:30pm GMT) in New York, diplomatic sources said. The emergency meeting has been called in response to the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian troops. The session was requested by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, diplomats told AFP, with the United States, France, Norway, Ireland and Albania joining the call for an urgent meeting. It will include speeches from an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) official and a UN official. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to Russians to stage protests over Russian forces’ seizure of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. A building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was set ablaze during intense fighting, triggering fears of a potential nuclear disaster. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, according to figures by the United Nations. Around half of a million of those who have fled are youngsters, the UN children’s agency UNICEF estimates. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has projected that more than four million Ukrainian refugees may eventually need protection and assistance. UNCHR communications chief Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate of the exodus as “phenomenal”. We know that there are many more on the move. Also there are possibly equal numbers inside the country that are internally displaced. Russia is using cluster bombs in Ukraine, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said. We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law. Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. Establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine could result in the war spreading to more European countries, the Nato secretary general. Speaking to reporters in Brussels after a meeting with Nato foreign ministers, he said: We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (establishing a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a fully-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries. Allies agreed not to have Nato planes operating in Ukrainian airspace or Nato troops on Ukraine’s territory, he said. At the same time, we have a responsibility as Nato allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering. Asked about the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Nato secretary general said: The reckless actions around the nuclear power plant last night just highlights the dangers of this war. War is dangerous and to have military operations conflict fighting going around the nuclear power plant adds to the danger. Stoltenberg stressed that Nato is not seeking a war with Russia. Speaking in Brussels, he said Nato is a “defensive” alliance. “Our core task is to keep our 30 nations safe,” he said. We are not part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine. That would be even more devastating and more dangerous, with even more human suffering. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the days to come are “likely to be worse” with Russian forces expected to bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across Ukraine. Speaking after an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Stoltenberg described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. With cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled. Reckless actions around a nuclear power plant last night and many civilians killed or wounded. The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more sufferings, and more destruction. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has strongly condemned the shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and called for the international community to force Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In a statement posted on Facebook, the ministry said the Zaporizhzhya NPP and Chernobyl NPP are currently under the control of Russian armed forces. As a result of the shelling on the territory of the (Zaporizhzhya) nuclear power plant, a fire broke out, killing and injuring several people. The fire has now been extinguished. It warned that if the cooling of the nuclear fuel within the Zaporizhzhya plant is disturbed, it could cause radioactive damage and have “irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment”. Thousands of people – including civilians who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to ongoing shelling and fighting - would be hurt by this. The ministry added that it was disappointed by the reaction of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and demanded “clear and decisive action” from the UN atomic agency. No release of radioactive material has been detected at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after a military projectile hit a nearby building on the site, UN atomic chief Rafael Grossi has said. Two members of security staff were injured when the projectile struck after the Ukrainian authorities reported an overnight battle with Russian troops near Europe’s biggest power plant. In an update, Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, said the nuclear power plant continued to be operated by its regular staff. The safety systems of the plant’s six reactors had not been affected and there has been no release of radioactive material. Radiation monitoring systems at the site are fully functional. The situation “remains very challenging”, Grossi added, and it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to determine if all systems are fully functional. I’m extremely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and what happened there during the night. Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time. The UN human rights council has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution condemning alleged rights violations by Russia in Ukraine and setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate them. Only Eritrea voted with Russia against the resolution brought by Ukraine, while 13 abstained. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Yevheniia Filipenko, told the council there was “irrefutable evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia”. It is our common duty to ensure accountability by mandating the documentation and verification of Russia’s crimes and identification of those responsible. Vladimir Putin has warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. Speaking at a government meeting broadcast today, the Russian president said: There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours. I would also advise them not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions. We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them. Russia did not see “any need” to “aggravate or worsen” relations with other countries, he continued. All our actions, if they arise, they always arise exclusively in response to some unfriendly actions, actions against the Russian Federation. Ukraine’s culture ministry has called for closing the skies over Ukraine because Russian forces are “destroying Ukrainian cultural sites”. Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine’s minister of culture and information policy, said most of Putin’s “war crimes” in his country had been “committed from the air”, according to a statement by the ministry. Russia’s missiles and planes are deliberately destroying historic centres of big cities. Putin wants to destroy Europe’s heritage and culture, wipe it from the face of the earth. The statement warned: A mad dictator threatens to destroy St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a Unesco church built in the 11th century. Hundreds of innocent victims, the total destruction of churches, cathedrals and museums – is the price of the still opened sky over Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Otaci is a Moldovan border town, on the opposite side of the Dniester River lies the Ukrainian city of Mohyliv-Podilskyi. As refugees spill over the bridge that links the two, local people are rallying together to provide them with warm food, shelter, internet and free onward travel in cars and taxis. Since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February, more than 1 million people have fled across the closest borders. The conflict could result in the “largest refugee crisis this century”, the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months. So far, more than 98,000 refugees have entered Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. The time in Ukraine is 1.05pm. Here is a roundup of the main stories from the day so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. The power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a fresh appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on the capital. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. The Russian parliament has passed a law that makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly. The UK Home Office has rejected suggestions that immigration minister Kevin Foster refused to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss the growing refugee crisis. The home affairs committee has urged him to rethink “given the urgency of the situation”. In a statement, it said: Parliamentary under-secretary of state for immigration and future borders, Kevin Foster MP, has declined an invitation from the home affairs committee to give evidence on the UK’s response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The committee had issued the invitation to understand what the UK was doing to provide support and refuge to people leaving Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. It is estimated that 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict. Given the urgency of the situation, the committee has asked the minister to reconsider. A Home Office spokesperson said: Home Office ministers are busy responding to the situation in Ukraine at this critical time, including helping reunite thousands of families in the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme. Minister Foster has not refused to attend but asked for a later date given this urgent work. Following the news that the BBC has been blocked in Russia, the outlet has been quick to remind people it can be accessed via the ‘dark web’. The BBC linked to an article from 2019 on Twitter that helps users access its content in restricted countries. However, if it is already blocked for the user, the Twitter page also provides some direct links for “dark web” access to its news website. Russia’s communications watchdog has restricted access to several foreign news organisations’ websites including the BBC and Deutsche Welle for spreading what it described as ‘false information’, amid friction about reporting on Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly complained that western media organisations offer a partial – and often anti-Russian – view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for devastating foreign wars such as Iraq and corruption, Reuters reported. The watchdog said on Friday it had blocked the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle and other media outlets, Interfax news agency reported. The BBC said it would not be deterred. “Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week,” it said. “We will continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world.” Some users in Russia could not access the BBC’s website on Friday. Following the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant the director general of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday that he has offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia. The aim would be to agree a framework to guarantee safety of nuclear plants during the conflict, including how to ensure the physical integrity of sites, maintaining power, safety monitoring systems and that staff at sites are able to fulfil duties. Both sides are considering the proposal. “The situation continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” said Grossi. He added: The physical integrity of the plant has been compromised with what happened last night. we are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and the integrity of the reactors themselves were not compromised. I have indicated to both the Russian Federation and Ukraine my availability and disposition to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible. Two experts have offered some reassurance that the military activity at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is unlikely to cause a major nuclear incident. Dr Mark Wenman, reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, said: The Zaporizhzia nuclear plant has six VVER-1000 pressurised water reactor units producing 20% of Ukraine’s electricity. The plant is a relatively modern reactor design and as such the essential reactor components are housed inside a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building that can withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions. The reactor core is itself further housed in a sealed steel pressure vessel with 20cm thick walls. The design is a lot different to the Chernobyl reactor, which did not have a containment building, and hence there is no real risk, in my opinion, at the plant now the reactors have been safely shut down. Prof Tom Scott, at the University of Bristol, UK said: Shelling nuclear power plants is against the Geneva conventions and this is obviously very worrying. The good news is that radiation levels around the plant are reportedly normal and five of the six reactors are now turned off, with one still operating. The reactors are all pressurised water reactors and hence don’t have graphite cores which could set on fire as per Chernobyl. Their inherent safety design should mean they are naturally quite resilient to any external perturbations and hence I am not overly concerned that inadvertent damage could cause a major nuclear incident. However, it would be more concerning if the reactors were being deliberately targeted to induce a nuclear incident. Ahead of a busy day of diplomacy in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stontenberg has said the attacks by Russia on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest in Europe – highlight the “recklessness” of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said: We condemn the attacks on civilians and overnight we have also seen the reports about the attacks against a nuclear power plant. This just shows the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it. And the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts. British foreign secretary Liz Truss is in Brussels for a meeting of Nato ministers and later she will join EU foreign ministers who are also hosting Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, Canada’s foreign minister Mélanie Joly and Stoltenberg. Russia’s defence ministry has sought to blame an attack at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Ukrainian saboteurs. Ukraine said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, in an incident that provoked international condemnation of Moscow, a week into its invasion of Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the nuclear plant was operating normally and the area had been under Russian control since 28 February, Reuters reported. “However, last night on the territory adjacent to the power plant, an attempt was made by the Kyiv nationalist regime to carry out a monstrous provocation,” spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed directly to Russians to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe,” he said in a televised address. In the UK, the mayor of Salford has written to Michael Gove to ask for help to cut ties with the Russian energy firm Gazprom, warning that “state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of Local Government services within the United Kingdom”. Paul Dennett wants his local authority not to have to renew its non-domestic natural gas contract with Gazprom, agreed in June 2020 when the Russian firm far outbid domestic providers. He says that councils across the country also use Gazprom because it is so much cheaper than other companies and so automatically wins procurement competitions. Gazprom also provides energy to a number of NHS trusts. On Thursday, the health secretary Sajid Javid began talks with NHS England (NHSE) over ending the contracts, which are reported by Politico to have been worth £16m in 2021. “Our contract will be up for renewal in June, and I do not wish for public money to be spent towards the income of the Russian state during the present military crisis in Ukraine. However, at present under the current round of sanctions and/or rules, such considerations would seemingly not be considered legally relevant in assessing Gazprom’s suitability for winning the next tendering exercise (or not),” Dennett writes in a letter to Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up. Dennett says Salford is fully supportive of the government’s stated ambitions to “inflict devastating consequences on President Vladimir Putin and Russia” following Russia’s unprovoked assault on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, using sanctions and other financial measures. “However, state-owned and/or backed Russian organisations and services are still woven inextricably into the delivery of local government services within the United Kingdom, and at present their involvement in bidding for tenders and contracts is enshrined in UK public procurement regulations for the procurement and tendering of services,” writes Dennett. He wants Gove to change the law to make it easier for local authorities to break ties with Gazprom and stop Gazprom pitching for replacement contracts, even if it means having to pay more for municipal energy. Forty-seven people were killed in Russian airstrikes on a residential district of the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Thursday, regional authorities said. It updates an earlier announced death toll of 33 killed, the Reuters news agency reported. Rescue work had to be suspended on Thursday due to heavy shelling, according to the local emergency services. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the British justice secretary said on Friday. Dominic Raab, who is also deputy prime minister, was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. He said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC (international criminal court) is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. Canada wants Nato to discuss all scenarios to isolate Russia, the country’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said when asked whether the alliance should consider a no-fly zone over Ukraine. On her arrival at an extraordinary meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Joly said Nato’s red line was to avoid triggering an international conflict, when asked about the no-fly zone, Reuters reported. But she added: “We want to make sure that scenarios are being discussed”. Meanwhile, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said Nato must adapt military posture at its eastern flank to new reality after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have to adapt the posture to the reality, which shows that the Russians troops are in Ukraine and in Belarus, so we need to rethink everything,” he told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. Romania will increase its defence spending to 2.5% from 2% of GDP starting with the next fiscal year, he added. The Russian parliament has passed a law which makes it a criminal offence to spread “fake” information about its armed forces. The law, passed by the state Duma in the third and final reading, introduces fines and jail sentences for those who intentionally spread false information about the armed forces that has a serious impact, according to a statement by the lower house. Those found to have broken the new law by spreading so-called “false information” about the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine face up to three years in prison. If it is published as part of an “organised group” or uses “false evidence”, the maximum sentence increases to 10 years in prison. If it leads to “serious consequences”, the perpetrators will face up to 15 years in prison. It is thought this new law will have a huge effect of the ability of people to share information about what is happening in Ukraine, as the Kremlin continues to play down its actions to the Russian population. Latvia’s foreign minister has said Nato should “consider all options” when asked about entering direct conflict with Russia. Edgars Rinkēvičs told the BBC’s Today programme that governments “should not exclude” any recourse to stop the invasion. Earlier, the programme heard from former Ukrainian prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who said other European countries “don’t understand” the lengths Putin will go to, PA Media reported. He said leaders from other countries should offer direct military support and “at least to close our skies to protect us from the threat”. Asked about the comments, Mr Rinkevics said: I think we should consider all options but we should also understand, let’s say, some Nato policies can be implemented only if those countries that have necessary assets agree on that. He added that any decision would have to be voted for unanimously. Asked whether Nato may instead be forced to broker an “uncomfortable” settlement with Russia, the minister replied: Well, I think we must do everything that we can. That’s why I’m saying that we should not exclude any options. I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you all the latest news over the next couple of hours. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities. An update written at 7.30am on the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine’s Facebook page reads: The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation.” However, the inspectorate says employees are continuing to work on the premises, while operational personnel control the safe condition of the power units. According to the inspectorate units two and three have been disconnected from the network and and nuclear installations are being cooled down “Changes in the radiation state for the current time have not been recorded,” the update adds. However, the potential loss of cooling nuclear fuel could lead to “significant radioactive emissions into the environment” and such an event “may outgrow all previous NPP accidents, including the Chernobyl NPP and Fukusima-Daichi NPP” the authority says, adding that any damage to a reservoir of processed nuclear fuel as a result of the shelling could also lead to radioactive discharge. Here is where we stand so far: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the fire was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Share prices fell in Asia in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire while the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Vladimir Putin earlier told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. The ministry noted that Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control but has “likely been encircled by Russian forces” while the city’s civilian infrastructure has been subjected to intense Russian strikes. It also confirmed receiving reports from Ukrainian authorities of a building at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant catching fire after shelling by Russian forces. Meanwhile, the Moscow stock exchange remained closed for the fifth day in a row on Friday as Russian authorities rolled out additional measures to limit the economic impact from imposed sanctions, the Moscow Times reports. Share prices fell in Asia today in the wake of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant fire. Tokyo and Hong Kong faced the steepest falls, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index 2.5% lower and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down by 2.6%. Oil prices rose in Asia morning trade, with Brent crude above $112 a barrel. Meanwhile, bulls have surged into the US crude oil options market in recent days as futures touch highs not seen in a decade, betting that crude’s rally will persist, according to analysts and exchange data cited by Reuters. The global oil market was already tight even before Russia invaded Ukraine last week, which has since sent benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 15% to about 10- and 14-year highs, respectively. US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc will not pre-emptively ban all Russians from using the platform, chief executive officer Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on Friday. “We don’t think there’s a high risk of Russian oligarchs using crypto to avoid sanctions,” Armstrong said, adding that “some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed”. Meanwhile, home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. Essential equipment at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been unaffected from an earlier fire, with no change in radiation levels, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, citing Ukraine’s regulatory authorities. “The Ukraine regulatory authority said a fire at the site had not affected ‘essential’ equipment and plant personnel were taking mitigatory actions,” it said. “There was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant.” US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm earlier provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at the power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency before the fire broke out that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP). British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The prime minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN security council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” A charter aircraft carrying Russian foreign nationals was held at the Yellowknife airport in Canada’s Northwest Territories, transport minister Omar Alghabra said in a tweet on Thursday. “We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine,” Alghabra added. It remains unclear whether the passengers were transported to their onwards destination. According to the New York Times, two Russian nationals flying in a private jet that had taken off from Geneva landed in northern Canada this week and were prevented from travelling farther, citing Canadian officials. Canada announced on Sunday that it would ban Russian aircraft from entering Canadian airspace in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and the European Union have similar policies in place. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy early this morning made appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. Guardian reporter, Luke Harding, is currently in Lviv, western Ukraine where he says demoralised Russian soldiers tell of their anger at being “duped” into war. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of nuclear terrorism after a fire burned for several hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant early Friday morning. The shelling of the nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, prompted widespread concern about the safety of Ukraine’s atomic infrastructure. “We are warning everybody – not a single state apart from Russia has ever shelled nuclear reactors,” Zelenskiy said. “It is the first time in our history, in the history of humankind, that the terrorist state turned to nuclear terrorism.” Watch the video of Zelenskiy’s remarks below. Ukrainian emergency services confirmed just a short while ago that a fire which had broken out in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant was extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. Ukrainian authorities said the fire was ignited by shelling from Russian forces, claiming Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. At 6.20am local time, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services issued an update published to their social media channels: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished.” According to the agency, no casualties have so far been reported. Fighting at the plant also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. It is 7.20am in Ukraine as Russia’s war enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis currently stands: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after shelling by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.” British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Vladimir Putin earlier told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com",

Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”.</p> <p>Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”.</p> <p>She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.”</p> <p>She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation.</p> <p>However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans.</p> <p>France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel.</p> <p>Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said.</p> <p>He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022.</p> <p>France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power.</p> <p>Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date.

                    "bodyText": "The European Commission is facing a furious backlash over plans to allow gas and nuclear to be labelled as “green” investments, as Germany’s economy minister led the charge against “greenwashing”. The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

The Rural Fire Service told Guardian Australia that wind turbines could be negotiated like any other obstacle. “Wind turbines are treated in the same way as other hazards across the landscape, such as power lines, radio or television transmission towers and mountains, all of which need to be taken into account in mission planning and by individual pilots,” a spokesperson said. Both Joyce, who has a property at nearby Woolbrook, and the National party state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, attended a Voice for Walcha meeting in January in opposition to the project. Walcha was previously in the state electorate for Tamworth, but will fall under Northern Tablelands in the redrawn electoral boundaries for the 25 March poll. Marshall told the gathering the proposal contained “the very worst EIS I have ever, ever seen”. Joyce repeated calls for nuclear reactors to replace ageing coal-fired generators, instead of wind, and asked locals to march on Canberra. “I’m gonna tell you one thing: the [wind turbine] technology will be so out of date, it will be ridiculous. It will be antiquated,” Joyce told the crowd at the Walcha Bowling Club. “Personally, I believe that nuclear power will be in, and it’ll be something that would fit in this room that will do the job of thousands of wind turbines.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, Vestas says the company recognises “that change can be difficult and the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy involves regional areas like Walcha”. It says it remains committed to engaging with the community openly and transparently. The Walcha mayor, Eric Noakes, says the council has taken a “neutral stance” on the project, with “councillors for it, councillors against it”. Noakes says the project has been “divisive” and he hopes the fault lines don’t run too deep. “We’ve always been a tight community – we’ve got to be a tight community to survive the tough times,” he says. “We’ll need our resilience as a community again one day.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/09/speed-stealth-and-firepower-the-submarines-that-redfine-australias-strategic-personality\">‘Speed, stealth and firepower’: the submarines that redefine Australia’s ‘strategic personality’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/14/australias-aukus-nuclear-submarines-estimated-to-cost-at-least-70bn\">long-term submarine program cost</a> at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/24/we-dont-have-limitless-resources-australian-government-prepared-to-scale-back-defence-projects\">interview with Guardian Australia in January</a>, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/peter-dutton-believes-he-has-found-labors-weak-spot-but-can-he-move-beyond-defending-millionaires\">opposing modest savings</a>.</p> <p><strong>2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines?</strong></p> <p>The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say\">The Guardian</a> reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready\">potential capability gap</a> caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/australia-expected-buy-up-5-virginia-class-submarines-part-aukus-sources-2023-03-08/\">Reuters reported</a> Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/03/submarines_compared/giv-13425uBoeTYmvdZPT/\" data-alt=\"Aukus submarines \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/03/submarines_compared/giv-13425uBoeTYmvdZPT/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs?</strong></p> <p>The government – and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says\">chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce</a> – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/malcolm-turnbull-says-labor-has-failed-to-answer-if-aukus-deal-compromises-australian-sovereignty\">the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull</a> have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released.</p> <p><strong>5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control?</strong></p> <p>Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces.</p> <p><strong>6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it?</strong></p> <p>Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/12/no-clunkers-australia-buying-highest-quality-secondhand-submarines-from-us-congressman-says\">expressed confidence</a> the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada.</p> <p><strong>7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state?</strong></p> <p>This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap.</p> <p><strong>8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says\">Australia will put nuclear safety ‘above all else’ as it builds submarines, vice admiral says </a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important.</p> <p><strong>9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service?</strong></p> <p>The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process.</p> <p><strong>10. How does the plan fit </strong><strong> with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water?</strong></p> <p>The Australian National University’s National Security College report <a href=\"https://nsc.crawford.anu.edu.au/publication/16666/transparent-oceans-coming-ssbn-counter-detection-task-may-be-insuperable\">Transparent Oceans?</a> found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is preparing to make the most significant announcement since he took office, joining the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, to unveil the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan on Tuesday morning AEDT. For now, many questions remain unanswered. Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday. 1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all? None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the long-term submarine program cost at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an interview with Guardian Australia in January, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is opposing modest savings. 2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines? The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once? The Guardian reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, Reuters reported Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met. 4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs? The government – and the chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released. 5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control? Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces. 6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it? Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – expressed confidence the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada. 7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state? This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap. 8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region? This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important. 9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service? The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process. 10. How does the plan fit with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water? The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate.",

From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south</strong> and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter.

responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base.</strong></p> \n  <p>Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport.</p> \n  <p>Ukraine has not directly taken credit for the strike, but few seem to give much credence to a Russian explanation that it was an accidental explosion.

He said President Vladimir Putin has long insisted Crimea is Russian and warned that any attempts to take it back would trigger massive retaliation. He claimed Moscow’s apparent swallowing of the strike showed Putin’s weakness.</p> \n  <p>“He’s expected to protect Crimea as Russia proper. Now he’s afraid to recognise that it was done by the Ukrainian armed forces,” he added.</p> \n  <p>Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike at areas in Ukraine’s south.</p> \n  <p>“Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said.</p> \n  <p>The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said it couldn’t independently assess what caused the explosions, but noted that simultaneous explosions in two places at the base likely ruled out an accidental fire – but not the possibility of sabotage or a missile attack.</p> \n  <p>But, it added: “The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defence systems.”</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><em>This is Martin Belam back on the live blog for an hour or so.

Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines: The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that one person died and 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the air base near Novofedorivka. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. Seven in 10 previous or current UK sponsors of Ukrainian refugees say their ability to provide support has been hindered by the cost of living crisis, figures have suggested. Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. That’s it from the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning but, for now, good night. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace said the UK has “pretty much dismissed” most of the Russian “excuses” for explosions at an air base in Crimea, and said he thinks the site would be a “legitimate target” for the Ukrainians. He told the BBC: I think when you just look at the footage of two simultaneous explosions not quite next to each other, and some of the reported damage even by the Russian authorities, I think it’s clear that that’s not something that happens by someone dropping a cigarette. Asked if the base was a legitimate target for the Ukrainians to strike, he said: First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, under United Nations articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force. So, is it legitimate? It’s absolutely legitimate for Ukraine to take lethal force, if necessary, but take force in order to regain not only its territory, but also to push back its invader. And that air force base has been used by Russian air forces to bomb Ukrainian targets. So I think in anybody’s sort of manual of war it would be a legitimate target. Estonia has summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry said in a release, saying the helicopter had flown over a point in the southeast of the small Baltic nation without permission. Estonia made an identical complaint to Moscow in June, Reuters reported. The United Nations expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukraine grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN co-ordinator at the Joint Co-ordination Centre in Istanbul, which oversees a deal between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations to resume Ukraine grain exports. The EU has been urged to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists with some member states saying visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy”, he said. The Ukrainian president’s call was backed by Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who tweeted that visiting Europe was “a privilege, not a human right”, adding: “Time to end tourism from Russia. Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has aired the same frustrations, telling public broadcaster YLE that it was “not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists.” Finland has previously said that increasing numbers of Russians have begun crossing the 830-mile border between the two countries to shop in border stores and travel onwards to other EU destinations since Covid restrictions were lifted. Ukraine’s air force said it believed that up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine indicated the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv of a dramatic incident that one expert believed may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He added: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20 billion in international bonds, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, a move that will allow the war-torn country to avoid a debt default. With no sign of peace or a ceasefire on the horizon nearly six months after Russia’s invasion began, bondholders have agreed to postpone sovereign interest and capital payments for thirteen Ukrainian sovereign bonds maturing between 2022 and 2033. The government in Kyiv launched a consent solicitation, which is a formal request to agree with creditors on changes to sovereign debt contracts, on 20 July, Reuters reported. Ukraine on Wednesday called on the European Union and G7 countries to stop issuing visas to Russian citizens, citing what he said was their support for the invasion of Ukraine. “Russians overwhelmingly support the war on Ukraine. They must be deprived of the right to cross international borders until they learn to respect them,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. The tweet echoed earlier calls by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a one-year travel ban and the apparent expulsion of Russians living in the West so they can live “in their own world until they change their philosophy”, Reuters reported. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west over its invasion of Ukraine, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansions of the Nato defence alliance and support for forces seeking to align Ukraine with the European Union rather than Moscow. “As the initiator and main instigator of the Ukrainian crisis, Washington, while imposing unprecedented comprehensive sanctions on Russia, continues to supply arms and military equipment to Ukraine,” Zhang was quoted as saying. “Their ultimate goal is to exhaust and crush Russia with a protracted war and the cudgel of sanctions.” In case you missed it earlier today … Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. Without claiming explicit responsibility for an attack on a Russian airfield in Crimea on Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said on Wednesday that it had destroyed nine Russian planes within the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Ukraine has not directly taken credit for the strike, but few seem to give much credence to a Russian explanation that it was an accidental explosion. In its daily update, Ukraine’s army increased the number of planes it had claimed to have destroyed to 232 from 223. The Associated Press has spoken with Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov about the explosions. He said President Vladimir Putin has long insisted Crimea is Russian and warned that any attempts to take it back would trigger massive retaliation. He claimed Moscow’s apparent swallowing of the strike showed Putin’s weakness. “He’s expected to protect Crimea as Russia proper. Now he’s afraid to recognise that it was done by the Ukrainian armed forces,” he added. Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike at areas in Ukraine’s south. “Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike,” Zhdanov said. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said it couldn’t independently assess what caused the explosions, but noted that simultaneous explosions in two places at the base likely ruled out an accidental fire – but not the possibility of sabotage or a missile attack. But, it added: “The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defence systems.” This is Martin Belam back on the live blog for an hour or so. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Seven in 10 previous or current UK sponsors of Ukrainian refugees say their ability to provide support has been hindered by the cost of living crisis, figures have suggested. Some 21% of people who have hosted or are currently hosting Ukrainians in their homes said the rising cost of living has affected their ability to provide support “quite a lot”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A further 9% said it affected their ability to help “very much” while 41% said it had been affected “a little”, PA Media reported. Twenty-six per cent said it had not affected their ability to help at all while 3% replied “don’t know”. Four Russian missiles hit a village on the southern outskirts of Ukraine’s city of Zaporizhzhia early on Wednesday, killing a 52-year-old woman, whose body was found in the rubble, the regional governor said. “Four private buildings have been totally destroyed. Several dozen houses have been left without windows and roofs,” governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram. Rescue workers were still digging through the rubble hours later, the governor said. Electricity and gas supply to the village of Kushuhum were also disrupted, he added. A Ukrainian mother and her son prepare to leave Lisbon, where they went to flee the war two and a half months ago. Despite ongoing conflict with Russian forces in the south and east of the country, the UN Refugee Agency has reported more than 4.4m border crossings back into Ukraine since 28 February. Many of those crossing are thought to be Ukrainians heading back to parts of the country now considered relatively safe, hoping to reunite with family, rebuild their country and restart their lives. Katya and Nazar set off for Kyiv hoping to make it in time to celebrate Nazar’s ninth birthday. Russian authorities have raided the home of a former state TV journalist who quit after making an on-air protest against Moscow’s war in Ukraine. They have also launched a criminal case against her on the charge of spreading false information about Russian armed forces, her lawyer said on social media. The case against Marina Ovsyannikova was launched under a law, enacted after the 24 February invasion of Ukraine, that penalises statements against the military, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison, the Associated Press reported. Zakhvatov told the independent news site Meduza the case is probably linked to a protest Ovsyannikova staged last month, holding a banner that said “Putin is a killer, his soldiers are fascists”. After the raid, Ovsyannikova is expected to be brought into the Investigative Committee for questioning, he said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova previously worked as a producer with the Russian state-funded Channel One. She made international headlines on 14 March when she appeared behind the anchor of an evening news broadcast holding a poster that said “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here”. She was charged with disparaging the Russian military and fined 30,000 roubles (around £223.40 at the time). Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From 7-9 August , the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions that occurred on Tuesday, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that, additionally 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. Ukraine’s army claims to have destroyed nine Russian planes in the last 24 hours. It did not specify the locations. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. At least 13 people have been killed overnight by shelling in Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 20 buildings were damaged. Ukraine’s emergency service has distributed images which appear to show a school in Marhanets damaged by an attack. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, said that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am Wednesday morning, three people, including a 13-year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published Wednesday. The US state department has approved $89m-worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to continue our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published today. Reuters reports the interview precedes a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday when British, Danish and Ukrainian defence ministers are expected to discuss long-term support for Ukraine, including military training, mine clearance and weapon supplies. “Within a short time, Denmark is sending 130 military instructors to a British training project,” defence minister Morten Bodskov told the newspaper. The Danish defence ministry had no immediate comment. Ukraine’s emergency services has issued some photographs this morning that it claims shows the damage in Marhanets after it was strike by Russian shelling. Early, the regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said at least 13 people died. Russia’s military briefing for the day has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. It states that it has killed up to a further 130 Ukrainian service personnel. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has issued updated figures this morning for the losses it says it has inflicted on pro-Russian forces. Notably, without specifying where it happened, today’s figures indicate they destroyed nine Russian planes or helicopters in the last 24 hours. It claims to have killed “about 42,800” military personnel in total since 24 February, an increase of 160 on the day before. It also said: “The opponent suffered the biggest losses in the Donetsk direction.” The daily operational briefing from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. It says this came after Ukrainian forces shelled 10 of the 266 settlements it claims have been “liberated” from Ukrainian forces. It says 72 houses and nine civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. None of the claims have been independently verified. The DPR is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states, including Russia. This morning we have been sent some images over the newswires from inside occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. The pictures were taken on a trip organised by the Russian military, and appear designed to show that ordinary work and life continues under the auspices of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Several of the photographs were taken at a coal mining operation in Dolzhansk. The LPR was formed in 2014, and is recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. One image released shows the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, attending a movie premiere for a film entitled Match, which glorifies the actions of Soviet Union soldiers during the second world war. Another part of the trip appears to have been to demonstrate that an equestrian school was running as normal. The RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that 13 people were injured and one died as a result of explosions at the airport in Novofedorivka. It quotes the authority’s statement saying: “As of 8.30am, as a result of an incident in the urban-type settlement of Novofedorivka, Saki district, 13 people were injured and one person died.” RIA goes on to report that “one person was hospitalised in the Saki regional hospital, another 10 patients with minor injuries, including two minors, received medical care on an outpatient basis. Two more victims went to Simferopol hospital No 6, after rendering assistance they were allowed to go home.” The claims have not been independently verified, and the cause of the explosions remains somewhat unclear. Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhail Podolyak has denied Ukrainian responsibility for an attack, and the Russian military have said only that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. There is some clarification here on the numbers killed overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Reuters reports governor Valentyn Reznichenko now says that at least 13 people died after shelling there. He said more than 20 buildings were damaged in Marhanets, a city across the Dnipro River from the Russian-captured Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The attack damaged a power line, leaving several thousand people without electricity, Reznichenko said. The attack damaged a hostel, two schools, a concert hall, the main council building and other administrative bases, he added. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, despite the evidence of damage to civil infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Lviv’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said the night passed without incident in his western region of Ukraine. He said that 306 people arrived in evacuation trains from the east of the country, where the fighting is concentrated. He said that 761 left on evacuation trains to Poland. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent from inside Ukraine and Crimea over the newswires. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram to say that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am, three people, including a 13 year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. He also claimed that yesterday, during the day, there had been several fires in the fields caused by Russian attacks, and that “settlements of the Bereznehuvate community, located on the demarcation line, remain under constant fire”. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam with the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian officials are reporting that 11 people were killed and 13 wounded by Russian shelling in the Nikopol district in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region overnight. Residential homes were reportedly damaged in the attack and as many as 1,000 people are without gas, the regional regional military administration said. Russian commanders are likely to be faced with the competing operational priorities of reinforcing the Donbas offensive, and strengthening defences against anticipated Ukrainian counter attacks in the south. To support the Ukraine operation, Russia has “almost certainly” established a major new ground forces formation, 3rd Army Corps (3 AC), based out of Mulino, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast east of Moscow, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest British intelligence report reads: Russia likely plans to resource a large proportion of 3 AC from newly formed ‘volunteer’ battalions, which are being raised across the country, and which group together recruits from the same areas. Russian regional politicians have confirmed that potential 3 AC recruits are being offered lucrative cash bonuses once they deploy to Ukraine. Recruitment is open to men up to 50 years old and with only middle-school education. A Russian army corps typically consists of 15-20,000 troops, but it will probably be difficult for Russia to bring 3 AC up to this strength, given very limited levels of popular enthusiasm for volunteering for combat in Ukraine. 3 AC’s effect is unlikely to be decisive to the campaign.” The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, officials said in a statement on Tuesday. The funding is the largest US de-mining program yet in Ukraine, and the official compared Ukraine’s challenge to attempts to disarm unexploded ordnance in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos following the American war of the 1960s and 70s in Southeast Asia. “If you look at some conflicts in the not so distant past, the Vietnam War for example, we’re still clearing ordnance in Southeast Asia 50 years after that war ended. This may be on par with that,” the official said. The program would be run through contractors and non-governmental organisations the official said. He said the money, part of which comes from Ukraine-linked budget requests, will not only fund training, but specialised mine detection and earth moving equipment if need be. A Ukrainian official said the aid addressed one of the country’s most important tasks. “By our estimates, 160,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian land need de-mining, which is about the size of Virginia, Maryland and Connecticut combined,” said Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top aide. “This aid will accelerate Ukraine’s recovery,” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said in a Telegram post. US president Joe Biden formally welcomed Finland and Sweden joining the Nato alliance Tuesday as he signed the documents of ratification that delivered the US’s formal backing of the Nordic nations entering the mutual defence pact. The move is the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In seeking to join Nato, Finland and Sweden are making a sacred commitment that an attack against one is an attack against all,” Biden said at the signing as he called the partnership the “indispensable alliance.” Finland and Sweden’s decision to join Nato is a watershed moment for our Alliance. It will help ensure greater security and stability for our world,” Biden added. On a slightly lighter note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is being made into an action figure by a product design company in Brooklyn, New York. FCTRY launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production two weeks ago, hitting its $30,000 funding goal in just three hours and raising more than $120,000 since. For every figure sold, $1 goes to Ukraine in the campaign which ends on Friday. A six-inch (15-cm) tall clay prototype of the Zelenskiy action figure, moulded by Seattle artist Mike Leavitt, will be mass produced in plastic in China. It is expected to ship by March. “The way we framed him in the campaign is ‘the unlikely hero,’” said Jason Feinberg, FCTRY’s chief executive and creative director. “He’s the perfect leader for this moment, just this super inspirational character. He has this real strength that comes across, but it’s humble and he sort of represents the opposite of everything that we’ve come to associate with politics.” In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks in Crimea but vowed to “liberate” the region. This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. But we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka – these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free.” Ukraine is not taking responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Mykhail Podolyak, asked by the Dozhd online television channel whether Kyiv was taking responsibility, replied: “Of course not. What do we have to do with this?” Earlier, he appeared to suggest the strike could herald a new phase of the conflict. Podolyak said that Kyiv’s long-term goal was “demilitarisation of the Russian Federation”. He added: “The future of the Crimea is to be a pearl of the Black Sea, a national park with unique nature and a world resort. Not a military base for terrorists. It is just the beginning.” Ukraine’s defence ministry said it could not determine the cause of the explosions but added, sardonically, that people should have regard for the rules of fire safety and “the prohibition of smoking in unspecified places”. A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea on Tuesday afternoon, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It is not clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Russian tourists holidaying on beaches nearby could be seen leaving in fear. It is one of few occasions that the peninsula, occupied by Russia since 2014, has been directly affected by the latest fighting. Local people told one Russian news site that explosions went on for an hour. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said one person had died. Earlier, he had filmed a video statement near the site, with smoke rising in the distance, saying that ambulance crews and medics were on the scene. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and was occupied by Russia early in its invasion. Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Reuters news agency that Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. Their plan is to damage all the lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. After that it will not be connected to the Ukrainian power system,” he said. Kotin also told Ukrainian television and Interfax news agency: The Russian military present at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are implementing the program of [Russian operator] Rosatom aimed at connecting the plant to the Crimean electricity grid. To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working. When the last production line is disconnected, the plant will be powered by generators running on diesel. Everything will then depend on their reliability and fuel stocks.” The process of de-energisation of the plant in preparation to connect to Russia would be extremely dangerous, Kotin warned. At the ZNPP, we are already very close to this first stage of Fukushima-1, because there is only one line. As soon as it is turned off, the station will switch to diesel, and after that everything will depend on the reliability of their work and the sufficiency of the fuel that is there for diesel engines at the ZNPP.” Kotin also spoke with CNN, reiterating his claims that the ultimate plan of the Russians is to disconnect the plant from powering Ukraine and connect it to the grid to power occupied Crimea. If there is no connection to the grid, then you cannot provide electricity from the outside, then the diesel generators will start. But everything will depend on the reliability of those generators. … This is a dangerous situation, because if those stop you could have a disaster of melting nuclear materials,” he said, comparing the potential fallout to the Fukishima disaster in Japan. If the situation worsens, we need to think about our population at the plant. We are planning on how, during war conditions, we will be able to evacuate the personnel. Great release of radioactivity could happen from there. There could be a cloud, a radioactive cloud.” Located not far from the Crimean peninsula, the plant has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, capable of supplying power for four million homes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday raised the spectre of nuclear disaster after strikes on the plant. And UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that any attack on a nuclear plant would be “suicidal”. “I hope that those attacks will end, and at the same time I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant,” he said Monday. Recent fighting around the plant has prompted the UN nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to warn of the “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Ukraine has denied responsibility for explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Meanwhile, Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine are preparing to connect the plant to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and are damaging it by reorienting its electricity production, Ukrainian operator Energoatom warned. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person. It was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved.

The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. The total number of grain-carrying ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a UN brokered deal to ease the global food crisis has now reached 12, with the two latest ships which left on Tuesday headed for Istanbul and Turkey. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit onboard a Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials.",

play down reports that a Russian-led security alliance of former Soviet countries is weakening in the wake of the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, called into question the effectiveness of the six-nation Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) at a summit this week.</p> <p>During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the CSTO in Yerevan on Wednesday, Pashinyan stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left.</p> <p>Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a>, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement.</p> <p>Armenia’s criticism follows comments from Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, at the UN general assembly in September during which he implicitly criticised Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p> <p>On Sunday, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said attempts to break up CSTO had always existed and would continue to do so, but insisted that the alliance remained in high demand despite criticism this week from Armenia.</p> <p>“There have always been attempts to [bring about] the CSTO’s disintegration,” news agencies quoted Peskov as saying in an interview broadcast on state television.</p> <p>“But at least now we see that, despite all the difficulties, despite the possible contradictions even between member countries, this structure remains in high demand,” he said. “And it fully demonstrated its relevance and effectiveness, meaning the resolution of the situation in Kazakhstan.”</p> <p>Russia, the dominant player in the CSTO, risks losing influence in parts of the former Soviet Union that it has long seen as its sphere of influence, as the conflict in Ukraine drags into its 10th month.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-27T13:38:32.772Z\">at

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Associated Press news agency has filed this update on the ongoing shelling by Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine overnight.</p> <blockquote> <p>With persistent snowfall blanketing the capital, Kyiv on Sunday, analysts predicted that wintry weather — bringing with it frozen terrain and gruelling fighting conditions — could have an increasing impact on the direction of the conflict that has raged since Russian forces invaded Ukraine more than nine months ago.</p> <p>But for the moment, both sides were bogged down by heavy rain and muddy battlefield conditions in some areas, experts said.</p> <p>After a blistering barrage of Russian artillery strikes on at least two occasions over the past two weeks, infrastructure teams in Ukraine

And a young couple’s account of helping citizens and Kyiv’s army during the Russian onslaught in Kherson. Hundreds of Ukrainians streamed out of Kherson city on Sunday to flee Russian shelling, two weeks after its recapture from Russian occupying forces prompted jubilant celebrations. The liberation of Kherson marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv – reconquered after the Russians retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. However, since then inhabitants have struggled with no water, heating and electricity, because Moscow’s troops destroyed thermal and power plants before they left. Evacuations began last week amid fears that damage to infrastructure caused by the war was too severe for people to endure over Ukraine’s harsh winter. The exodus has been exacerbated by Russian shelling, which has killed 32 civilians since Russian forces left the city on 9 November. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” Yevhen Yankov told the Associated Press as a van he was in inched forward. “Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population.” Ukraine only has enough power to cover 80% of its electricity needs, according to the country’s state grid operator Ukrenergo. It comes after Russia’s seventh attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as part of a new strategy. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 6pm in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can,” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, was on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday. Accompanied by the Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around €37.4m. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Joseph Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships could be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian. Belarus’s long-time foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has “passed away suddenly”, the Belarusian state-run news agency Belta reported, without giving further detail. Belarus has been an ally of Russia and a base over the border for the invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel that “we are shocked by the reports of the death”. Makei had been due to meet Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Minsk on Monday. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. Russia is firing ageing cruise missiles stripped of their nuclear warheads at Ukrainian targets because Vladimir Putin’s stocks are so depleted, the UK Ministry of Defence has suggested. An intelligence update from the ministry on Saturday said the desperate improvisation by the Russian president’s struggling forces were “unlikely to achieve reliable effects”. The head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion, Reuters reports. Such a move would be a major battlefield change in the partially-occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region where the frontline has hardly shifted for months. Repeated shelling around the plant has spurred fears of a nuclear catastrophe. “In recent weeks we are effectively receiving information that signs have appeared that they are possibly preparing to leave the [plant],” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, said on national television. “Firstly, there are a very large number of reports in Russian media that it would be worth vacating the [plant] and maybe worth handing control [of it)] to the [International Atomic Energy Agency],” he said, referring to the United Nations nuclear watchdog. “One gets the impression they’re packing their bags and stealing everything they can.” Russia and Ukraine, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in Chornobyl in 1986, have for months repeatedly accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia reactor complex, which is no longer generating energy. Asked if it was too early to talk about Russian troops leaving the plant, Kotin said on television: “It’s too early. We don’t see this now, but they are preparing [to leave].” “All of the [Ukrainian] personnel are forbidden to pass checkpoints and travel to Ukrainian[-controlled] territory.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has likened Russia’s tactics in Ukraine to the Holodomor, a man-made famine engineered by Joseph Stalin that led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians. Saturday was Holodomor Remembrance Day. The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of its aid package, the UK has provided Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to the Ukrainian armed forces. ”This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” it said. My colleague Dalya Alberge has a story of a film studio that had to help the artists working out of its Kyiv branch flee the country when Russia invaded. The Kremlin has sought to play down reports that a Russian-led security alliance of former Soviet countries is weakening in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, called into question the effectiveness of the six-nation Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) at a summit this week. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the CSTO in Yerevan on Wednesday, Pashinyan stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Armenia’s criticism follows comments from Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, at the UN general assembly in September during which he implicitly criticised Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Sunday, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said attempts to break up CSTO had always existed and would continue to do so, but insisted that the alliance remained in high demand despite criticism this week from Armenia. “There have always been attempts to [bring about] the CSTO’s disintegration,” news agencies quoted Peskov as saying in an interview broadcast on state television. “But at least now we see that, despite all the difficulties, despite the possible contradictions even between member countries, this structure remains in high demand,” he said. “And it fully demonstrated its relevance and effectiveness, meaning the resolution of the situation in Kazakhstan.” Russia, the dominant player in the CSTO, risks losing influence in parts of the former Soviet Union that it has long seen as its sphere of influence, as the conflict in Ukraine drags into its 10th month. The retired Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly, who embarked on the longest single space flight by an American, has visited Ukraine. Kelly, 58, a veteran of four space flights, visited the Okhmatdyt specialised children’s hospital. Some shocking images of the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson have been published by AP photographer Bernat Armangué. The bridge, the main crossing point over the Dnipro River in Kherson, was destroyed by Russian troops earlier in November, after Kremlin forces withdrew from the southern city. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian army of deliberately destroying critical infrastructure during their withdrawal from the city, including electricity and water supplies. Ukrainian troops entered Kherson on 11 November after the Russian army had withdrawn from the city, which they captured in the early stage of the conflict, shortly after Russian troops had entered Ukraine in February 2022. The Associated Press news agency has filed this update on the ongoing shelling by Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine overnight. With persistent snowfall blanketing the capital, Kyiv on Sunday, analysts predicted that wintry weather — bringing with it frozen terrain and gruelling fighting conditions — could have an increasing impact on the direction of the conflict that has raged since Russian forces invaded Ukraine more than nine months ago. But for the moment, both sides were bogged down by heavy rain and muddy battlefield conditions in some areas, experts said. After a blistering barrage of Russian artillery strikes on at least two occasions over the past two weeks, infrastructure teams in Ukraine were fanning out in around-the-clock deployments to restore key basic services as many Ukrainians dealt with only a few hours of electricity per day — if any. Ukrenergo, the state power grid operator, said on Sunday that electricity producers are now supplying about 80% of demand. That’s an improvement from Saturday’s 75%, the company says. In the eastern Donetsk region, five people were killed in shelling over the past day, according to governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Overnight shelling was reported by regional leaders in the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk areas to the west. Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said one person was killed and three wounded in the northeastern region. The Belgium prime minister, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, is on the second day of an unannounced visit to Ukraine. Accompanied by Belgian foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, De Croo used the visit to announce additional Belgian support of around 37.4 million euros. De Croo has been visiting different parts of the country including Bucha, where in April almost 500 bodies of residents were discovered in the streets of the city, victims of the Bucha massacre, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians by Russian Armed Forces. The Belgian PM also visited Borodianka in Kyiv Oblast and was photographed standing in front of a recent Banksy mural, showing a small boy throwing a man, thought to represent Russian president Vladimir Putin, in judo attire over his shoulder. Most of the buildings in Borodianka, a small town on an important access road to Kyiv, have been destroyed by Russian bombings in the first months of the Russian invasion. Ukraine should take responsibility for any legal action against Russia because the West could “corrupt the process” for “cheap gas and oil”, a former international criminal prosecutor has told the Sunday Telegraph. Prof Sir Geoffrey Nice KC was the lead prosecutor against Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Serbia, at the UN’s Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia between 1998 and 2006. He has been visiting Kyiv in recent months to discuss how perpetrators of potential war crimes might be held to account. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he warned that “there are real risks of it subcontracting out” any legal action to the international community, saying it may end up with Crimea and the Donbas being sacrificed for a peace deal in exchange “for cheap oil and gas” for the West. He warned that foreign powers could pressure Ukraine into accepting “a negotiated settlement” that could compromise the Donbas and Crimea - Ukrainian regions invaded by Russia. Karim Ahmad Khan KC, the British barrister who serves as International Criminal Court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, launched an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine in March. But there has been no meaningful update since then. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has posted a message of support for Ukraine this morning on his official Twitter account, accompanied with a video narrated by Ukrainian voices. I believe in freedom. I believe we should stand up for the fundamental rights that matter so much to us all. For our sovereignty, for our self determination and for the foundations of a stable international order we are all fighting to restore. The Ukrainian people face bombing in the day and blackouts at night. But we know our friends will always be there to help see us through. The UK is one of our most steadfast allies. They give weapons for our battle, kit to keep us warm and friendship to restore our spirits. We know they will never let us down as we fight to win this war. With your help, we will secure our freedom. Together we will never back down, together we will be strong, together we will protect Ukraine and the freedoms we all cherish so much. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has warned rape in war violates international values as severely as the use of chemical weapons. Speaking to the Sunday Times on the eve of hosting a major international conference on preventing sexual violence in conflict in London, Cleverly said the “abhorrent act” is being used in Ukraine and other parts of the world. “This is an absolutely abhorrent act and yet we are seeing in Ukraine and other parts of world this is still being used as a weapon of war. We need to make sure that military commanders understand that it is just as unacceptable as the use of chemical weapons or as the killing or abuse of prisoners of war,” he said. Cleverly said he was horrified when he met victims in Yemen and Iraq as a junior foreign office minister two years ago. “It’s harrowing and now I ‘hear similar stories coming out from Ukraine and it never gets less painful,” he said. He had a chance to hear testimony first-hand in Ukraine where he spent two days seeing the missile damage that has left much of the country, including the British embassy, without power and water. More than 50 ministers from around the world are flying in, as well as 50 survivors from 20 countries from Colombia to South Sudan, including the Nobel peace prize winner Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who has become a powerful advocate after being held as a sex slave by Islamic State fighters. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Saturday that Ukraine would continue to resist Russian attacks, as the country marked the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor famine that affected millions of Ukrainians under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Agence France-Presse reported that several European leaders travelled to Ukraine to pledge support after weeks of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid caused widespread power and water cuts as temperatures plunge with the onset of winter. Zelensky said in a video posted on social media: Once they wanted to destroy us with hunger, now – with darkness and cold. We cannot be broken. Leaders from Belgium, Lithuania and Poland were in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Saturday to commemorate victims of the 1932-33 Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – regarded by Kyiv as a deliberate act of genocide by Stalin’s regime. The Polish and Lithuanian prime ministers were also in Ukraine for talks that, according to local media, could focus on a possible new wave of migration from Ukraine this winter. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, paid his respects at a Holodomor memorial in Kyiv during his first visit to the country since Russia invaded. He posted photos on Twitter of him shaking hands with Zelenskiy, writing: Arrived in Kyiv. After the heavy bombing of recent days, we stand with the people of Ukraine. More than ever before. Belgium pledged a further €37.4m ($39m) of financial aid for Ukraine, the Belga news agency reported. Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties during fighting in Ukraine’s south-central Donetsk province and are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough there, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence update said the area around the towns of Pavlivka and Vuhledar, in Ukraine’s east, had seen “intense combat” in the past two weeks but that little territory had changed hands. The ministry tweeted: Both Russia and Ukraine have significant forces committed to this sector, with Russian naval infantry having suffered heavy casualties. This area remains heavily contested, likely partially because Russia assesses the area has potential as a launch point for a future major advance north to capture the remainder of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast. However, Russia is unlikely to be able to concentrate sufficient quality forces to achieve an operational breakthrough. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have both announced new financial aid packages to support Ukrainian grain exports, which have been disrupted by the war. Macron said in a video statement: The most vulnerable countries must not pay the price of a war they did not want. Agence France-Presse also reported that the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, vowed the EU would continue to support Ukraine, accusing Russia of using “food as a weapon”. Heavy snowfall was expected in Kyiv starting on Sunday, with temperatures dropping below freezing day and night, while millions of people who still live in and around the Ukrainian capital remain with little electricity and heat. Reuters reported grid operator Ukrenergo as saying on Saturday that electricity producers were able to cover only three-quarters of consumption needs, necessitating restrictions and blackouts across the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there were restrictions on the use of electricity in 14 of Ukraine’s 27 regions and in Kyiv, for “more than 100,000” customers in each of the regions. He said in his nightly video address: If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally. Sergey Kovalenko, chief operating officer of Yasno, which provides energy to Kyiv, said the situation in the city had improved but remained “quite difficult.” He indicated residents should have at least four hours of power a day. Ukrainians have streamed out of Kherson to flee Russian shelling, just weeks after celebrating Ukraine’s recapture of the southern city. Associated Press reported that a line of trucks, vans and cars – some towing trailers or ferrying out pets and other belongings – stretched a kilometre or more on the outskirts of Kherson on Saturday. Days of intensive shelling by Russian forces prompted a bittersweet exodus: many civilians were happy that their city had been won back but lamented that they couldn’t stay. “It is sad that we are leaving our home,” said Yevhen Yankov, as a van he was in inched forward. Now we are free, but we have to leave, because there is shelling, and there are dead among the population. Poking her head out from the back, Svitlana Romanivna added: We went through real hell. Our neighborhood was burning, it was a nightmare. Everything was in flames. Emilie Fourrey, emergency project coordinator for aid group Doctors Without Borders in Ukraine, said an evacuation of 400 patients of Kherson’s psychiatric hospital, which is situated near both an electrical plant and the frontline, had begun on Thursday and was set to continue in the coming days. Russia has ratcheted up its attacks on critical infrastructure after suffering battlefield setbacks. A prominent Russian nationalist said Saturday that the Russian military didn’t have enough doctors – a rare public admission of problems within the military. Hello and welcome back to our ongoing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a quick look at the latest news at it approaches 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. There are growing fears Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of the unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday but two generators were damaged in the process. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko. Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Josef Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. Volodymyr Zelenskiy hosted a summit in Kyiv with allied nations on Saturday to launch a “grain from Ukraine” initiative to export $150m worth of grain to countries most vulnerable to famine and drought. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships can be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, the Ukrainian president has said in a statement released to the Guardian.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment.",

                    "bodyText": "There is little mention of Boris Johnson’s “green industrial revolution” on the campaign trail of the two Conservative party leadership candidates. Maybe it’s not surprising when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are focused on formulating plans to deal with the more immediate energy crisis. That said, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pressing ahead with announcing the investments they would make to achieve net zero by 2050. A new prime minister could do worse than crack on with some of the plans in Johnson’s 10-point programme, announced to great fanfare in 2020. The plans are behind schedule and several of the ideas are considered by experts to be dead ends. The CBI has accused the government of relying too heavily on private-sector investment, which it blames for Britain falling behind Europe and the US. The Biden administration is poised to pass a near $370bn bill to promote climate-friendly infrastructure. Johnson’s 10-point plan committed the government to spending £12bn. The government’s own adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said the money on offer needed to be closer to £50bn to make a difference. Nevertheless, piecing together the ideas and investment needed to create a zero-carbon economy is achievable and could create more sustainable jobs, if the new regime can decide what it wants to do. Offshore wind The offshore wind industry has put the UK in the front rank of countries managing the switch away from fossil fuels. More arrays in the sea are planned on the east and west coast. Official figures show that meeting net zero targets would mean cutting gas use by 65% by 2035, and almost 100% by 2050. At the moment gas accounts for about 90% of home heating and 40% of electricity generation. At 37%, heating accounts for the largest proportion of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Kwasi Kwarteng, a chief ally of Truss’s, said this year he would expand onshore wind, helping speed up the transition. While the UK has only limited capacity to make wind turbines, and the number of jobs created by businesses servicing windfarms is small in relation to the size of the investment, the employment is highly skilled and expert firms could export their knowhow. Sunak said at a recent hustings that regulations governing offshore wind, rooftop solar and nuclear would be overhauled to scale up supply, despite the critics arguing that solar is held back by a lack of power storage facilities and all renewables are at the mercy of an electricity grid in desperate need of an upgrade to cope with a coal, oil and gas-free world. Low-carbon hydrogen The UK’s ambition for hydrogen production was recently doubled to 10 gigawatts by 2030. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting water vapour, warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. But, depending on the method of burning, it can also cause health-harming air pollution and, as a climate-heating gas itself, any leakage of hydrogen could offset some of the advantages of its use. A favourite of the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, hydrogen is also seen as the green fuel of the future by the car company Toyota and the Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, which owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain. Iberdrola’s subsidiary Scottish Power plans to use government subsidies to build a 100 megawatt plant at Felixstowe to provide enough fuel to power 1,300 hydrogen trucks operating inside the port from 2026. Hydrogen cells could take over from diesel to power trucks, farm equipment and diggers, but there would need to be significant funding to create a UK industry. Nuclear power There is a new power station taking shape at Hinkley Point in Somerset and the government has approved another at the Sizewell site in Suffolk at an expected cost of £20bn. Both will be built by the French electricity company EDF. The Sizewell C site could be challenged if local people pursue an appeal over the next few weeks. The CBI boss, Tony Danker, has urged the government to push on with the investment, and Sunak has promised to go ahead should he become leader, presumably whatever challenges lie ahead. Delays and cost overruns are likely and could help Rolls-Royce, which expects to have a series of mini-nuclear power stations ready by the end of the decade, though these have faced their own time and cost overruns. Zero-emission vehicles Britain spends about £27bn on new roads but very little on subsidising electric car production or the infrastructure of charging points that supports electric vehicles. Car firms, almost all of them foreign-owned, have complained that subsidies for UK production are small. Car parts suppliers have little incentive to adapt to electric cars. The battery maker BritishVolt is on “life support” as it wrestles with funding problems. Green public transport, cycling and walking Public transport is becoming green as electric buses become more popular. Electric cycles and scooters are being adopted at a rapid pace in some towns and cities. Cars are being forced to lower their speed in built-up areas. But pedestrians are being left out of schemes to create more livable cities, persuading families to stick with the suburbs and new housing estates that rely on private car travel. More investment in electric-powered trains would create jobs and make links across the railway network more reliable. There are plans to electrify the Midland mainline and the Transpennine route and upgrade the east coast mainline, but with HS2 likely to be stopped at Manchester, the spur to Leeds abandoned and HS3 across the northern cities scrapped, the opportunities to revive the push for electrification are many. The payback from integrating cycling, walking and public transport will be significant, as the Netherlands and Denmark have found. Greener buildings A building with solid walls built before the second world war costs about £20,000 to insulate and between £10,000 and £20,000 for a heat pump. There are about 8m of these homes. Even the best-insulated homes gain a category B certificate when an A is needed to meet zero carbon targets. It means even those built or refurbished in the last 30 years will need another facelift. And before embarking on this investment, ministers must stop developers checking their own homework. There are concerns that builders are cutting corners knowing local authorities lack the staff to check on them.

Natural environment Protecting nature has obvious benefits. Sunak commissioned a 360-page report from the eminent Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta detailing how the economy will suffer unless we protect the natural environment, but didn’t say what action he would take. Chancellors always delay taking action because while they understand investments create jobs and save the exchequer money in the future from flooding and drought, it is less clear how it creates businesses that generate tax income or export cash. • This article was amended on 18 August 2022.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russians to rally around their president and said that what happened next would depend on Kyiv’s stance in talks, adding that Russia had “clearly conveyed to the Ukrainian side our vision of solving this problem”. The UN Human Rights Council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia admitted to “limiting” access to news websites including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the independent Russian site Meduza and Germany’s Deutsche Welle, with Facebook also blocked.",

They can cause indiscriminate harm to civilians and have been banned under an international convention signed by more than 100 countries.</p> \n  <p>On the sidelines of the conference, which concluded this afternoon, Ukraine’s calls for cluster munitions were widely discussed among attendees. For EU officials, however, the demand is particularly difficult since most European countries are parties to the convention.</p> \n  <p>Asked at the conference about the calls for cluster munitions, Germany’s foreign affairs minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the country’s military support for Ukraine would be guided by the treaty. <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/waffenlieferungen-ukraine-kampfpanzer-1.5754025\">Süddeutsche Zeitung reported</a> that within the German government “it is considered impossible that chancellor Olaf Scholz could allow something like this”.</p> \n  <p>The reaction follows comments made by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olexander Kubrakov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/eu-must-jointly-purchase-weapons-to-foil-putins-plans-says-von-der-leyen-ukraine\">who suggested</a> Ukraine should be allowed to use cluster munitions on its territory.</p> \n  <p>When asked about this on Saturday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told reporters: “We understand that cluster ammunition is a debatable issue in world affairs. We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster munitions. So legally there are no obstacles for that.”</p> \n  <p>“If we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation,” he added.</p> \n  <p>Ukraine, like Russia and the US, has not joined the international convention on cluster munitions, which came into effect in 2010. <a href=\"https://www.un.org/disarmament/convention-on-cluster-munitions/\">The UN treaty prohibits</a> under any circumstance the use, stockpiling, production or transfer of the weapons.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-02-19T18:22:57.302Z\">at 6.22pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-63f257988f08826dd5d97cc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-02-19T17:25:47.386Z\">5.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3e95b0e4313ac9e7c942fd304c17cbadc4be41b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e95b0e4313ac9e7c942fd304c17cbadc4be41b/0_0_5021_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Germany on 17 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Germany on 17 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Szilagyi/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The<strong> Polish</strong> prime minister, <strong>Mateusz Morawiecki</strong>, said on Sunday he and President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in <strong>Poland</strong> and making it more permanent.</p> \n  <p>Biden will visit Poland over 20-22 February to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports.</p> \n  <p>Morawiecki told CBS’s Face the Nation:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are in the process of discussion with president Biden’s administration about making their (troop) presence more permanent and increasing them.

of the possible targets of the next Russian offensive.</p> \n  <p>Siversk is just 21 miles north of the city of Bakhmut - scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks - and on a direct road to another of the key towns in the Donetsk region, Sloviansk.</p> \n  <p>If Bakhmut falls, it is expected Russian forces would try to use it as a stepping stone to target Sloviansk as well as Kramatorsk, both larger cities.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to Reuters, one soldier, 30-year-old Stefan, said the Soviet-era artillery with which Ukrainian forces were defending Siversk was being outgunned.</p> \n  <p>“We have one artillery attack from our side, and the Russians can do it five times more,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the guys who are standing, especially at the first line [of defence], they feel it too much.”</p> \n  <p>The deputy Siversk battalion commander, who used the nom-de-guerre “Han”, said the capture of Bakhmut by the Russians would leave his forces “semi-encircled”.</p> \n  <p>“On the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” he said.</p> \n  <p>While capturing Bakhmut would be strategically useful to the Russians, Ukraine and its Western allies have said it would be a largely Pyrrhic victory, given the time taken and losses sustained.</p> \n </div> \n <p

Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato’s diminished standing were shattered overnight.</p> \n  <p>The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of “strategic autonomy”, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play.</p> \n  <p>The fact the sovereign, democratic nation of Ukraine has survived, unbowed and unconquered, is possibly the most remarkable outcome of the conflict so far. And Ukraine’s physical survival, despite significant losses of territory, has been matched by psychological triumph.</p> \n  <p>For this, much credit goes to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has campaigned tirelessly to whip up international support. Gifts of weapons, cash aid, technology, expertise and shelter have poured in, along with volunteers, military and civilian. In contrast, morale among Russia’s army and public has slumped.</p> \n  <p>But, and it’s a big “but”, it is plain the war is far from over and may be entering an even more dangerous phase.</p> \n

                    "bodyText": "We are now closing the blog. Here’s a summary of today’s events: Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and their fears of being “semi-encircled”. The state body that manages Ukraine’s nuclear power plants has said two missiles fired from the Black Sea on Saturday came “dangerously close” to hitting a plant in the Mykolaiv region. The US has said it believes China could be preparing to provide military aid to Russia, possibly including guns and other weapons. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war, according to the latest figures from the Ukrainian military. The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the war could be over “in weeks” if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” France has said it would deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also said in an interview that he wants Russia to lose the war but he does not want to see it “crushed”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelenskiy, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons.” The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting its defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Suggestions by senior Ukrainian government ministers that the country’s military should be provided with cluster munitions received a cool reception among western allies at the Munich security conference. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected calls to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs, telling German media the military alliance “has neither recommended nor supplied these kinds of weapons”. Cluster munitions are a type of weapon that split open mid-air to release smaller explosives over a wide area. They can cause indiscriminate harm to civilians and have been banned under an international convention signed by more than 100 countries. On the sidelines of the conference, which concluded this afternoon, Ukraine’s calls for cluster munitions were widely discussed among attendees. For EU officials, however, the demand is particularly difficult since most European countries are parties to the convention. Asked at the conference about the calls for cluster munitions, Germany’s foreign affairs minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the country’s military support for Ukraine would be guided by the treaty. Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that within the German government “it is considered impossible that chancellor Olaf Scholz could allow something like this”. The reaction follows comments made by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olexander Kubrakov, who suggested Ukraine should be allowed to use cluster munitions on its territory. When asked about this on Saturday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told reporters: “We understand that cluster ammunition is a debatable issue in world affairs. We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster munitions. So legally there are no obstacles for that.” “If we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation,” he added. Ukraine, like Russia and the US, has not joined the international convention on cluster munitions, which came into effect in 2010. The UN treaty prohibits under any circumstance the use, stockpiling, production or transfer of the weapons. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Sunday he and President Joe Biden will discuss the possibility of increasing US troop presence in Poland and making it more permanent. Biden will visit Poland over 20-22 February to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Morawiecki told CBS’s Face the Nation: We are in the process of discussion with president Biden’s administration about making their (troop) presence more permanent and increasing them. I’m very grateful also for sending new Patriot systems and other very modern weapons and munitions because this is also to some extent a proxy for presence of soldiers, but of course, the two go in tandem.” The US has about 11,000 personnel on rotation in Poland, according to CBS. Biden said last June the US would set up a new permanent army headquarters in Poland in response to Russian threats. He will meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and eastern European allies but has no plans to cross into Ukraine, according to the White House. The Biden administration is planning to impose new export controls and a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, targeting key industries, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The new sanctions will target Russia’s defence and energy sectors, financial institutions and several individuals, the report added. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, warned on the final day of the Munich security conference: Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians have a lot of applause and not enough ammunition. That’s the paradox. They need to be less applauded and better supplied with arms.” The Ukraine war will have cost the German economy around €160bn euros (£142bn), or about 4% of its gross domestic output, in lost value creation by the end of the year, the head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said. That means GDP per capita in Europe’s largest economy will be €2,000 lower than it would otherwise have been, DIHK chief Peter Adrian told the Rheinische Post, Reuters reports. German industry is set to pay about 40% more for energy in 2023 than in 2021, before the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February last year, a study by Allianz Trade said last month. “The growth outlook for 2023 and 2024 is therefore also lower than in many other countries,” Adrian said, adding that was also the case last year. Russia said on Sunday that Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow before a United Nations meeting, without providing evidence for the accusation. Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement that radioactive substances had been transported to Ukraine from a European country and Kyiv was preparing a large-scale “provocation”. “The aim of the provocation is to accuse Russia’s army of allegedly carrying out indiscriminate strikes on hazardous radioactive facilities in Ukraine, leading to the leakage of radioactive substances and contamination of the area,” it said. Ukraine and its allies have dismissed such accusations as cynical attempts to spread disinformation and accused Moscow of planning incidents itself in an attempt to blame Ukraine, Reuters reports. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick round-up of all the latest from the war in Ukraine. Three people were killed by shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The regional military administration said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire” and that one of the shells hit the yard of a family home. Ukrainian troops preparing for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donestk region if the town of Bakhmut falls have described being outgunned and fears of being “semi-encircled”. The state body that manages Ukraine’s nuclear power plants has said that two missiles fired from the Black Sea on Saturday came “dangerously close” to hitting a plant in the Mykolaiv region. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war, according to the latest figures from the Ukrainian military. The US has said it believes China could be preparing to provide military aid to Russia, possibly including guns and other weapons. The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the war could be over “in weeks” if the EU cannot increase its supply of ammunition to Ukraine. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly.” France has said it will deliver the AMX-10 light armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine “by the end of next week”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also said in an interview that he wants Russia to lose the war but he does not want to see it “crushed”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet with President Zelensky, according to reports. The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly in recent months, the body set up to monitor the shipments has said. The oil company Shell and energy trader Vitol have been accused of prolonging the war in Ukraine by exploiting a “loophole” in the EU sanctions regime to bring products derived from Russian oil into Europe through Turkey. Oleg Ustenko, the economic adviser to President Zelenskiy, has urged the energy companies to commit to a deadline to halt the trade of a “Russian-origin oil products” to reduce Vladimir Putin’s war coffers, the Guardian has revealed. The EU implemented a ban on importing seaborne Russian crude oil on 5 December – the same day as a G7 price cap on Russian seaborne exports – and the ban was extended on 5 February to refined products such as diesel and fuel oil. But analysis of data from commodity tracker Kpler by the non-profit group Global Witness found that Shell had imported more than 600,000 barrels of refined products into the Netherlands from Turkish refineries known to import Russian oil since 5 December. Read the full story here: Ukrainian troops in the small town of Siversk have said they are preparing to defend one of the possible targets of the next Russian offensive. Siversk is just 21 miles north of the city of Bakhmut - scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks - and on a direct road to another of the key towns in the Donetsk region, Sloviansk. If Bakhmut falls, it is expected Russian forces would try to use it as a stepping stone to target Sloviansk as well as Kramatorsk, both larger cities. Speaking to Reuters, one soldier, 30-year-old Stefan, said the Soviet-era artillery with which Ukrainian forces were defending Siversk was being outgunned. “We have one artillery attack from our side, and the Russians can do it five times more,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the guys who are standing, especially at the first line [of defence], they feel it too much.” The deputy Siversk battalion commander, who used the nom-de-guerre “Han”, said the capture of Bakhmut by the Russians would leave his forces “semi-encircled”. “On the left side we have the Siverskyi Donets river, and the enemy will advance from the right, and it is possible to cut us off if they reach the Bakhmut highway,” he said. While capturing Bakhmut would be strategically useful to the Russians, Ukraine and its Western allies have said it would be a largely Pyrrhic victory, given the time taken and losses sustained. Some final pictures here from the last day of the Munich security conference, where discussion among world leaders has been dominated by the war in Ukraine. France is to begin delivering the armoured vehicles it has promised to Ukraine, the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said on Sunday. The vehicles, of the AMX-10 type and sometimes described as “light tanks”, are used for armed reconnaissance and attacks on enemy tanks. Their combat weight is 20 tonnes, around a third of that of France’s Leclerc battle tanks. Speaking to Le Parisien newspaper’s Sunday edition, Lecornu said that training of Ukrainian crews on the AMX-10 was “nearly complete” the first vehicles would be sent “by the end of next week”. He declined to specify the number of vehicles in the first batch, saying he did not want to give Russia any “strategic information”. President Emmanuel Macron promised in early January that France would provide the AMX-10s after months of hesitation over fears of escalating the conflict. The war in Ukraine will be over unless the EU finds a way in weeks to speed up the provision of ammunition, the EU foreign affairs chief has warned. Speaking on the final day of the Munich security conference, Josep Borrell said a special meeting of EU defence ministers slated for 8-9 March would provide a chance for countries to offer ammunition from their existing stocks. He added that it was taking up to 10 months for European armies to order and receive a single bullet. “We are in urgent war mode,” he said. “This shortage of ammunition has to be solved quickly; it is a matter of weeks.” Read the full story here: The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet President Zelenskiy, Reuters reports, citing a political source. Meloni, who took office in October, had said she planned to visit Kyiv before the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Meloni, who heads the rightwing Brothers of Italy party, has been strongly supportive of Ukraine since taking office in October, but there are frictions over the issue within the coalition government that she leads. The former PM Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, last week said he would not seek a meeting with Zelenskiy if he were still head of government because he blames him for the war. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, another of Forza Italia’s founders, said on Saturday he had met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, on the sidelines of a G7 meeting at the Munich security conference to reassure him of Italy’s support. Italy and France have also recently finalised talks over delivery of an advanced air defence system to Kyiv in the spring. Former champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko has urged Ukraine’s allies to maintain their support for its resistance to the Russian invasion. Klitschko is the brother of Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, and since the war began has made frequent public appearances to rally support for his country. Speaking at a panel event on the final day of the Munich security conference, he said Ukraine was “completely depending” on “all the allies of the free world” and that it was “important to understand how much joy we have to live in a democracy”. “We talk about democracy but we don’t know what it feels like, and it’s so great,” he said. “So please keep on supporting us in Ukraine, because we are you. And you are us. It doesn’t matter what is in front of us - one of the strongest armies in the world, or weapons – our will is indestructible.” Gesturing to the people in the hall, he added: “Because it’s our will, of us, the free world.” The US has said it believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine, prompting a direct warning against doing so from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to China’s top diplomat. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a blunt meeting on the sidelines of the Munich security conference. He also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been buying Russian oil, but probably below the US$60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation after he met with Wang, Blinken said: “We’ve made very clear to them that [providing lethal support] could cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.” Read the full story here: Two Russian missiles fired on Saturday flew “dangerously close” to a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the state body that runs the site has said. Energoatom, which manages the country’s nuclear plants, said that at 8.25 and 8.27am local time, two cruise missiles were recorded flying past the South Ukraine nuclear power plant. The plant sits in the Mykolaiv region around 80 miles north of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Early on Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said that four Kalibr missiles had been launched from the Black Sea and that two had been intercepted by air defence systems. “The threat of hitting the reactor with possible consequences – a nuclear disaster – was again high,” Energoatom said. “This is another act of nuclear terrorism of the Russian Federation, which threatens the security of the whole world!” The body also appealed to the International Atomic Energy Authority to take “all possible measures to stop Russian nuclear terrorism” and to establish “a no-fly zone over all nuclear facilities of Ukraine”. Three people were killed by Russian shelling near the southern Ukrainian city of Berislav on Sunday morning, according to local officials. Posting on Telegram, the military administration in the Kherson region said Russian forces struck the village of Burgunka with “massive artillery fire”. It said one of the shells hit the yard of a family home and that at least three people – a father, mother and uncle – had been killed. It added that five people – a grandmother, a man, a 13-year-old boy, a 10-year-old girl, and an eight-year-old boy – were wounded. All the injured are said to have been taken to a medical facility and to be receiving treatment. “The enemy is targeting peaceful people!” the post said. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began a year ago this week, was an extraordinary and unexpected event that has changed the world in which we live. Long-held assumptions about peace in Europe, post-cold war relations with Moscow and Nato’s diminished standing were shattered overnight. The war has revolutionised German defence policy, silenced French talk of “strategic autonomy”, boosted EU unity, revived US commitment to the transatlantic alliance, dramatised the global north-south divide, reduced the UN to the role of hand-wringing bystander and given the UK an opportunity, after Brexit, to show it still has an international role to play. The fact the sovereign, democratic nation of Ukraine has survived, unbowed and unconquered, is possibly the most remarkable outcome of the conflict so far. And Ukraine’s physical survival, despite significant losses of territory, has been matched by psychological triumph. For this, much credit goes to its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has campaigned tirelessly to whip up international support. Gifts of weapons, cash aid, technology, expertise and shelter have poured in, along with volunteers, military and civilian. In contrast, morale among Russia’s army and public has slumped. But, and it’s a big “but”, it is plain the war is far from over and may be entering an even more dangerous phase. Read the Observer view on the war in Ukraine in full here: Russia is probably using balloons to gather information about Ukraine’s defence systems and force it to use up ammunition, according to UK intelligence. In its latest update, the Ministry of Defence said that, on 12 February, Ukraine’s air force reported sighting a number of balloons near the eastern city of Dnipro. Ukrainian armed forces also said that, on 15 February, they spotted and shot down several balloons over the capital, Kyiv. They also said the balloons had radar reflectors – devices that help radar systems detect small objects – suspended beneath them. “It is likely that the balloons were Russian,” the UK update said. “They likely represent a new tactic by Russia to gain information about Ukrainian air defence systems and compel the Ukrainians to expend valuable stocks of surface to air missiles and ammunition.” The amount of grain leaving Ukraine under a deal to keep food flowing to developing nations has dropped significantly, according to the body set up to monitor the shipments. The Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which comprises inspectors from the UN, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, said food exports from three Ukrainian ports have fallen from 3.7m metric tons in December to 3 million in January. It added that the number of average daily inspections fell to 5.7 last month, down from a peak of 10.6 in October. The drop in supply equates to about a month of food consumption for Kenya and Somalia combined. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of deliberately delaying inspections of vessels to take “advantage of the opportunity of uninterrupted trade shipping” from its own ports on the Black Sea, a claim Moscow has dismissed as “simply not true”. One of the deals negotiated last summer to keep food supplies moving from ports in Ukraine is due to come up for renewal next month. Russia has sustained almost 143,000 casualties since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. The latest update from Ukraine’s ministry of defence said the number of casualties on the Russian side had reached 142,860, up by 590 since yesterday. It also said that 3,310 tanks and 6,545 armoured combat vehicles had been destroyed, increases of seven and 12 respectively. Tweeting the figures, the ministry included a quote from the Beatles’ 1968 song Back in the USSR: “Let me hear your balalaikas [a Russian instrument] ringing out.” President Zelensky has welcomed indications he has received in the last few days that attempts will be made to hold Russia legally accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine. Speaking in his nightly address, he said he had received “strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people”. “Every Russian attack on … every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state. We have to restore justice,” he said. On Friday, it was announced that a body called the Register of Damages Caused by Russian Aggression to Ukraine will be set up in The Hague to keep a record of the damage to Ukrainian households, businesses, and infrastructure caused by the war. Addressing the Munich security conference on Saturday, the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, also said the US had formally determined that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. In his own speech, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said that “we must see justice through the [international criminal court]” and “consider together how to ensure that Russia pays” towards the reconstruction of Ukraine. The US government has had conversations with Elon Musk about the use of Starlink satellite internet in Ukraine, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said. SpaceX this month said it had taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using the company’s Starlink service to control drones, saying it was “never never meant to be weaponized”. In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, due to air on Sunday, Blinken was questioned about whether the US had asked Musk, who serves as Starlink’s chief executive, to remove the restrictions. “Well, I can’t share any conversations we’ve had other than to say we’ve had conversations,” he said. SpaceX has privately shipped truckloads of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, allowing its military to communicate by plugging them in and connecting them with the nearly 4,000 satellites SpaceX has so far launched into low-Earth orbit. Russia has attempted to jam Starlink signals in the region, though SpaceX countered by hardening the service’s software, Musk has said. France wants Russia to be defeated in Ukraine but it does not want to “crush” it, president Emmanuel Macron has told paper Le Journal du Dimanche. “I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,” Macron said in an interview published on Saturday. “Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.” Macron has drawn criticism from some Nato allies for delivering mixed messages regarding his policy on the war between Ukraine and Russia, with some considering Paris a weak link in the western alliance. On Friday, Macron urged allies to step up military support for Ukraine. The US believes China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine prompting a direct warning from the US secretary of state Antony Blinken to China’s top diplomat not to take the step. Blinken made the warning to the Chinese state councillor Wang Yi on Saturday evening at a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference during which he also rebuked China over the use of an alleged spy balloon over US soil. In a blunt meeting he also urged China to stop helping Russia evade the impact of sanctions. China’s trade with Russia is increasing and it has been purchasing Russian oil, but probably below the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by the EU and G7 group of states. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. He made clear to Wang that “would have serious consequences in our relationship”. “There are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing, to include weapons,” Blinken said, adding that Washington would soon release more details. Wang told Blinken the United States must “face up to and resolve the damage” to bilateral relations “caused by the indiscriminate use of force”, according to a brief statement on Sunday by China’s foreign affairs ministry. Russia’s ambassador to the US on Sunday responded to the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, who accused Russia of crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine. Harris made the comments a day earlier at the Munich security conference where, five days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, western leaders are assessing Europe’s worst conflict since the second world war. “We regard such insinuations as an unprecedented attempt to demonise Russia in the framework of the hybrid war unleashed against us,” Anatoly Antonov said on the Russian embassy’s Telegram account. “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” The UN-backed Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says it has identified war crimes but has not concluded whether they amount to crimes against humanity. Organisations supported by the US Agency for International Development have documented more than 30,000 war crimes incidents since the invasion, according to the US government. Ukrainian officials said they were investigating the Thursday shelling of the city of Bakhmut as a possible war crime. Hello, this is Christine Kearney bringing you the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine war. Moscow has responded to Joe Biden’s presidential administration announcing, at the Munich security conference, the US’s formal conclusion that Russia has committed crimes against humanity during its nearly year-long war against Ukraine. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said: “In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine … there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity.” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, responded on Sunday: “There is no doubt that the purpose of such attacks by Washington is to justify its own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis.” About 40 heads of state and government as well as politicians and security experts from nearly 100 countries – including the US, Europe and China – are attending the three-day conference to discuss Europe’s security situation amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. In other developments at 9am in Kyiv and 10am in Moscow: China’s senior diplomat Wang Yi, one of the few external politicians able to influence Russia, announced that China would launch its peace initiative on the anniversary of the war, and has been consulting Germany, Italy and France on its proposals. China had “neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire” regarding the crisis in Ukraine, he said. Western leaders have reacted nervously to the Chinese peace plan for Ukraine due to be revealed this week, but cautiously welcomed the move as a first sign that China recognises the war cannot be regarded solely as a European affair. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia’s invasion, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow. The top diplomats met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of the Munich conference. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, called on the west to “double down” on its military support to Ukraine. “When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter,” he said. “But we proved him wrong then, and we will prove him wrong now.” He also offered to help other countries that were willing to send aircraft to Ukraine now. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said there was “no doubt” that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Harris also warned that any Chinese support for Russia in its war in Ukraine would reward aggression. Ukraine must win its battle against Russia’s invasion, said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, warning that a Russian victory might embolden Moscow to attack other countries. Pistorius said he assured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Germany and its allies would help Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the EU wants to work with the defence industry to quicken and scale up the production of ammunition, both for the Ukrainian military and to replenish stocks at home. It follows warnings from Kyiv that its forces need more supplies quickly. Poland is ready to support Ukraine with its MiG jets, but only if a broader coalition is formed with the United States as a leader, said the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is becoming “increasingly difficult” for the Russian government to “insulate the population” from the reality of the war. Air raid alerts were in place across much of western and southern Ukraine early on Saturday, with Ukrainian officials reporting that Russia fired four Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea. Two people were injured in a strike on the western city of Khmelnytskyi, according to the local mayor. One civilian was reported killed in shelling in the eastern city of Vovchansk, a few miles from the Russian border. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that its forces had captured Hrianykivka, a village in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region that is well to the north of most significant fighting. A briefing note from Ukraine’s general staff later on Saturday said the village was being shelled, but made no mention of an assault. The number of Russian soldiers killed since the invasion has reached 142,270, according to the Ukrainian military. A day earlier the UK’s defence ministry said as many as 60,000 Russian forces may have been killed in just under a year. The MoD said the casualty rate “has significantly increased since September 2022 when ‘partial mobilisation’ was imposed”. Most of Ukraine has power despite a series of major Russian attacks on the generating system, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, praising the work done by repair crews. Russia has carried out repeated waves of attacks on key infrastructure, at times leaving millions of people without light, heating or running water.",

                    "body": "<p>The bad news is that plagues are a constant companion to human civilisation. The good news is that we are getting better at explaining their causes and treating them without recourse to superstition.</p> <p>When the Black Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century, troupes of flagellants proceeded from town to town, surrounding local churches, beating themselves with spiky, iron-tipped leather scourges. They saw the disease as divine punishment and prayed fervently for release from its clutches, all the while aiding its dispersal across the land. The medical treatments they needed were nearly 600 years away.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought its share of irrational fanaticism. There is something medieval about paranoid mobs felling mobile phone masts in the belief that 5G signals are responsible for the disease. But that minor skirmish is far from the frontline in a battle that science is winning, at least until the next disaster strikes. The march of progress gives cause for optimism; the certain recurrence of disaster less so. That tension is the subject of <em>Doom: </em><em>The Politics of Catastrophe</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/niall-ferguson\">Niall Ferguson</a>’s excursion into the history of horrible afflictions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What began as a taxonomy of doom evolves into a hawkish foreign policy treatise on the coming cold war with China</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is not a gloomy book, although it dwells often on our collective failure to learn from past mistakes. Ferguson’s interest is the patterns and systems that emerge from the repetition, to which end he skips quite breezily through a rich catalogue of gruesome, miserable experiences: floods, earthquakes that swallow whole cities, volcanic eruptions that bring humans to the brink of extinction, wars, famines and an array of lower-division horrors. The sinking of the Titanic and nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl exhibit at microcosmic level much the same “fractal geometry of disaster” discernible in the macro calamities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82d604414dda626f7b6832cef79d1120e0bd4c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82d604414dda626f7b6832cef79d1120e0bd4c3/0_68_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A monument in Kiev to victims of the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Terrible politics can manufacture calamity out of nature.’ A monument in Kiev to victims of the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ferguson’s rundown of disasters combines the man-made and natural kinds, exploring the boundary between the two. Sometimes it is distinct. The Romans did not provoke Vesuvius, whereas the Germans did invade Belgium in 1914. But in many cases, humanity is the accomplice to mass suffering from what looks ostensibly like natural causes, as when the Spanish flu ripped through barracks and trenches towards the end of the first world war. The virus racked up a much higher body count than bullets and artillery. Likewise, terrible politics can manufacture calamity out of nature, as when Stalin’s collectivisation policy led to famine in Ukraine and sustained it with repression.</p> <p>There are few cases where responsibility can be attributed so directly. There is usually too much chaos and complexity for any individual to have agency over the sweep of events. With some caveats, Ferguson endorses the view expressed by Tolstoy in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/01/war-and-peace-stories-lives-leo-tolstoy-james-wood\">War and Peace</a></em>, that Napoleon was the slave of historical forces beyond his comprehension, not their master. Leaders can be morally accountable for calamitous errors of judgment and, as with Hitler and the Third Reich, epoch-defining atrocities. But culpability is not all of causation. The origin of most catastrophes is elusive. There are too many threads going back too far, but also apparently stable situations can spiral abruptly out of control. It can take centuries for empires to decline, as happened with Rome, but they can also unravel overnight.

                    "bodyText": "The bad news is that plagues are a constant companion to human civilisation. The good news is that we are getting better at explaining their causes and treating them without recourse to superstition. When the Black Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century, troupes of flagellants proceeded from town to town, surrounding local churches, beating themselves with spiky, iron-tipped leather scourges. They saw the disease as divine punishment and prayed fervently for release from its clutches, all the while aiding its dispersal across the land. The medical treatments they needed were nearly 600 years away. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought its share of irrational fanaticism. There is something medieval about paranoid mobs felling mobile phone masts in the belief that 5G signals are responsible for the disease. But that minor skirmish is far from the frontline in a battle that science is winning, at least until the next disaster strikes. The march of progress gives cause for optimism; the certain recurrence of disaster less so. That tension is the subject of Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe, Niall Ferguson’s excursion into the history of horrible afflictions. It is not a gloomy book, although it dwells often on our collective failure to learn from past mistakes. Ferguson’s interest is the patterns and systems that emerge from the repetition, to which end he skips quite breezily through a rich catalogue of gruesome, miserable experiences: floods, earthquakes that swallow whole cities, volcanic eruptions that bring humans to the brink of extinction, wars, famines and an array of lower-division horrors. The sinking of the Titanic and nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl exhibit at microcosmic level much the same “fractal geometry of disaster” discernible in the macro calamities. Ferguson’s rundown of disasters combines the man-made and natural kinds, exploring the boundary between the two. Sometimes it is distinct. The Romans did not provoke Vesuvius, whereas the Germans did invade Belgium in 1914. But in many cases, humanity is the accomplice to mass suffering from what looks ostensibly like natural causes, as when the Spanish flu ripped through barracks and trenches towards the end of the first world war. The virus racked up a much higher body count than bullets and artillery. Likewise, terrible politics can manufacture calamity out of nature, as when Stalin’s collectivisation policy led to famine in Ukraine and sustained it with repression. There are few cases where responsibility can be attributed so directly. There is usually too much chaos and complexity for any individual to have agency over the sweep of events. With some caveats, Ferguson endorses the view expressed by Tolstoy in War and Peace, that Napoleon was the slave of historical forces beyond his comprehension, not their master. Leaders can be morally accountable for calamitous errors of judgment and, as with Hitler and the Third Reich, epoch-defining atrocities. But culpability is not all of causation. The origin of most catastrophes is elusive. There are too many threads going back too far, but also apparently stable situations can spiral abruptly out of control. It can take centuries for empires to decline, as happened with Rome, but they can also unravel overnight. The USSR passed from superpower status to non-existence in a matter of months. If there are no patterns discernible with hindsight, the individual living through some traumatic event has practically zero chance of making sense of it in real time. Mercifully, the human spirit is primed to get on with life in almost any circumstances. Sometimes, the best available explanation is expressed in a formula that Ferguson traces back to a San Francisco gang member cited in a master’s dissertation from 1964: “Shit happens.” Ferguson would hardly be fulfilling his remit as a historian if he stopped there.

There is, however, plenty of analysis showing LNG is only marginally less bad for the climate than coal – some commissioned by the gas industry itself.</p> \n<p>Dimitri Lafleur is a carbon analyst at Global Carbon Insights, a research group funded by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. He says statements like those made by McGowan are always “incomplete”.</p> \n<p>“Purely on a unit of energy basis, the combustion of gas is 60% of coal emissions. But then you have to look at the quality of the gas, the quality of the coal,” he says, noting you also have to consider what the gas is being used for.</p> \n<p>Calculations often ignore the impact of fugitive emissions – the loss of the potent greenhouse gas methane that can leak anywhere along the LNG supply chain – or the emissions from the vast amounts of energy used to liquefy the gas and then regasify the product it at its final destination (the biggest consumer of Australian gas is actually the country’s own LNG industry).</p> \n<p>“You need to have all of that in your calculations. It’s misleading to always come back to this idea that gas is only 60% or 50% of the emissions of coal,” Lafleur says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"386bfa7c28916919a03f31e5fa17124efc5623e9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/386bfa7c28916919a03f31e5fa17124efc5623e9/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark McGowan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark McGowan supports gas as a ‘transition fuel’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Temperature Check asked McGowan’s office for the basis of his statement that other countries would revert to coal if they were not sold gas, or that gas was less dirty.</p> \n<p>The questions were not answered, but a statement said: “The Premier reiterates his support of gas as a transition fuel noting there is strong demand from trading partners looking for lower-emissions energy sources.”</p> \n<p>In 2019, Woodside <a href=\"https://www.woodside.com.au/docs/default-source/sustainability-documents/climate-change/modelling-the-emissions-impact-of-additional-lng-in-asia.pdf?sfvrsn=fb147f13_3\">actually commissioned CSIRO</a> to “test the assumption through modelling scenarios that an increase in LNG in Asia will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions and support deployment of renewable electricity generation”.</p> \n<p>What was the conclusion? Unsurprisingly, the answer was nuanced, as it should be, but it contrasted with the simplistic claims often made about LNG.</p> \n<p>“Gas can assist [greenhouse gas] emissions mitigation during the period when carbon prices or equivalent signals are strong enough to force high renewable electricity generation shares,” it said.</p> \n<p>“Until the carbon price reaches that strength, increased gas supply’s impact on emissions reduction is either negative or neutral.</p> \n<p>“Also, after renewables have reached a high share, additional gas supply has nothing further to contribute to emission reduction.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning and afternoon email newsletters</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download our free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Australia’s two biggest LNG customers, according to the Office of the Chief Economist, are China and Japan.</p> \n<p>Analysis carried out <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/5/4/872\">a decade ago by engineering firm WorleyParsons</a> (now known as Worley) looked at the emissions of Australian LNG if it was exported to China and burned in power stations.</p> \n<p>The least dirty LNG produced from conventional wells burned in the most efficient gas plants generated 0.65 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. LNG from coal seams (the basis for Queensland’s LNG export industry) was dirtier, at 0.73 tonnes per megawatt hour. This is compared to black coal, which generated 0.78 tonnes per megawatt hour in the most efficient power stations and 1.03 tonnes in the dirtiest.</p> \n<p>But crucially the WorleyParsons study noted that when LNG was exported for electricity its greenhouse gas profile was at least 22 times dirtier than wind and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power.</p> \n<h2>Climate class action</h2> \n<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised an “end to the climate wars”. But the newly endorsed opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has signalled he wants to extend this particular cultural battleground to children’s classrooms.</p> \n<p>The Sky News host and News Corp commentator Andrew Bolt told Dutton this week that kids were crying with fear over the climate crisis, even though dams were filling, crops were getting bigger and they had “never been less likely to die in a climate catastrophe”.</p> \n<p>“Are you going to be the voice that says, look at the science, it’s not the climate crisis a lot of people are saying,” Bolt asked, not mentioning the unprecedented bushfires, floods, sea level rises or the basic physics of the greenhouse effect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Qldaah/status/1531755032802078721\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"I want to shine a light on that and let parents be the judge of what's being taught in their schools.\" Peter Dutton accuses teachers of extremism &amp; not being factual.

                    "bodyText": "Is Australia’s multibillion dollar gas industry going to help the region and the world decarbonise, as its supporters and the industry claims? Neat soundbites that gas is less dirty than coal, or factoids suggesting liquefied natural gas exports are pushing out those of more polluting coal, are plentiful and slip easily from the tongue, but are almost always bereft of detail. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was asked last week about the future of one mega-project already approved in his state – Woodside’s $12bn Scarborough LNG development. On climate change, McGowan said opposing gas sets up a “conundrum” and that “if we don’t provide gas, well, other countries put in more coal”. He told reporters that burning coal generated “two or three times the emissions” of gas. The new resources minister, Madeleine King, in comments reported in The West Australian on Thursday, said countries such as Japan, Korea and China were “demanding our gas for their path to net zero” and LNG projects would help countries “reduce their reliance on other fossil fuels that are higher carbon emitters”. “Australia’s gas industry is part of a decarbonising world – and it’s urgent,” she said. There are two huge problems with this, and both should be good reasons for politicians and commentators to hold back with their LNG truisms. One is the array of questions you need to answer before you can compare the climate impacts of gas to coal, not only in terms of emissions but also the effect that supplying LNG has on the uptake of renewable energy. Another is that although claims of LNG being significantly less dirty than coal have been made for more than a decade, there is practically no evidence to back this up. There is, however, plenty of analysis showing LNG is only marginally less bad for the climate than coal – some commissioned by the gas industry itself. Dimitri Lafleur is a carbon analyst at Global Carbon Insights, a research group funded by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. He says statements like those made by McGowan are always “incomplete”. “Purely on a unit of energy basis, the combustion of gas is 60% of coal emissions. But then you have to look at the quality of the gas, the quality of the coal,” he says, noting you also have to consider what the gas is being used for. Calculations often ignore the impact of fugitive emissions – the loss of the potent greenhouse gas methane that can leak anywhere along the LNG supply chain – or the emissions from the vast amounts of energy used to liquefy the gas and then regasify the product it at its final destination (the biggest consumer of Australian gas is actually the country’s own LNG industry). “You need to have all of that in your calculations. It’s misleading to always come back to this idea that gas is only 60% or 50% of the emissions of coal,” Lafleur says. Temperature Check asked McGowan’s office for the basis of his statement that other countries would revert to coal if they were not sold gas, or that gas was less dirty. The questions were not answered, but a statement said: “The Premier reiterates his support of gas as a transition fuel noting there is strong demand from trading partners looking for lower-emissions energy sources.” In 2019, Woodside actually commissioned CSIRO to “test the assumption through modelling scenarios that an increase in LNG in Asia will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions and support deployment of renewable electricity generation”. What was the conclusion? Unsurprisingly, the answer was nuanced, as it should be, but it contrasted with the simplistic claims often made about LNG. “Gas can assist [greenhouse gas] emissions mitigation during the period when carbon prices or equivalent signals are strong enough to force high renewable electricity generation shares,” it said. “Until the carbon price reaches that strength, increased gas supply’s impact on emissions reduction is either negative or neutral. “Also, after renewables have reached a high share, additional gas supply has nothing further to contribute to emission reduction.” Australia’s two biggest LNG customers, according to the Office of the Chief Economist, are China and Japan. Analysis carried out a decade ago by engineering firm WorleyParsons (now known as Worley) looked at the emissions of Australian LNG if it was exported to China and burned in power stations. The least dirty LNG produced from conventional wells burned in the most efficient gas plants generated 0.65 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. LNG from coal seams (the basis for Queensland’s LNG export industry) was dirtier, at 0.73 tonnes per megawatt hour. This is compared to black coal, which generated 0.78 tonnes per megawatt hour in the most efficient power stations and 1.03 tonnes in the dirtiest. But crucially the WorleyParsons study noted that when LNG was exported for electricity its greenhouse gas profile was at least 22 times dirtier than wind and 13 times dirtier than nuclear power. Climate class action The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised an “end to the climate wars”. But the newly endorsed opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has signalled he wants to extend this particular cultural battleground to children’s classrooms. The Sky News host and News Corp commentator Andrew Bolt told Dutton this week that kids were crying with fear over the climate crisis, even though dams were filling, crops were getting bigger and they had “never been less likely to die in a climate catastrophe”. “Are you going to be the voice that says, look at the science, it’s not the climate crisis a lot of people are saying,” Bolt asked, not mentioning the unprecedented bushfires, floods, sea level rises or the basic physics of the greenhouse effect. Dutton said: “If it was limited to just environmental issues or climate change then it would be bad enough. “The extremism of some of the teachers and the language that they use and the approach that they take … But it’s across a broad range of public policy areas.” Dutton said he wanted to “shine a light” on the issue and teachers should be able to “stick to the facts”, claiming “many teachers out there are incredibly frustrated by what’s taking place”. Prof Amy Cutter-Mackenzie, the dean of Southern Cross University’s faculty of education and an expert in environmental education, says Dutton’s words don’t ring true. “That is not a perspective I am hearing. In fact, I have not heard that from anyone in the educational community,” she tells Temperature Check. “Children are so far beyond whether climate change is human induced or not. “The suggestion teachers are scaremongering with the curriculum is utterly false. It’s not about scaremongering. It’s about understanding the world.” Going nuclear In the Australian newspaper, commentator Claire Lehmann was out advocating for “small modular nuclear reactors”. This sounds neat and tidy but the phrase covers a vast array of theoretical approaches and designs to build small nuclear power plants. The World Nuclear Association lists only five small reactors currently operating. In her advocacy, Lehmann claimed that while many environmentalists were opposed to nuclear power, they ignored that solar panels could “leak toxic heavy metals” and that wind turbines were responsible for “killing large numbers” of native birds. The number of birds that die from flying into windows, or being eaten by cats, dwarfs the small number that die when they fly into turbine blades. But Lehmann’s complaints about the potential for solar panels to leak while advocating for nuclear energy was unfortunately timed. She wasn’t to know that just days later a study would appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggesting that any future development and deployment of small modular reactors would “increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30”, depending on the design.",

                    "bodyText": "What was in the net zero review? Chris Skidmore, the head of the government’s net zero review, said he aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the UK’s net zero ambitions. The 323-page net zero review covers the whole of the UK’s economy, as well as the impacts on individuals and communities. Everything from the funding for net zero schemes to the need for regulation, parliamentary scrutiny, data, and research and development is examined, along with sectors of the economy from energy and transport to housing and farming. There are 130 recommendations, ranging from the highly specific, such as bringing forward the end of routine flaring by oil and gas companies from 2030 to 2025, to vaguer hopes, such as central and local government working more closely together. Some of the main recommendations cover: Energy The government should consider replacing the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas with a net zero fund that ringfences the proceeds for investment in offshore wind and other low-CO2 projects. Nuclear power should have a clear strategy, and the government must “double down on achieving the UK’s nuclear baseload requirement”, including small modular reactors and “a fleet of projects”, though the review does not specify how many new power stations should be built. Hydrogen should have a 10-year delivery plan, set out by the end of this year, that will require decisions on funding and technology, including hydrogen for home heating. Ministers should also “consider” requiring fossil fuel producers to “take back” the CO2 produced from burning their fuels, by storing 10% of it underground, using carbon capture and storage technology. Ofgem’s remit should be expanded to include the net zero target. Homes The boiler upgrade scheme should be extended, and people given incentives to buy heat pumps. Skidmore publicly called for “a rooftop revolution”, though some of the recommendations are slightly weaker – for instance, that there should be a consultation on whether new homes should be fitted with solar panels, and a supply chain built up for renewables. Farming Environmental land management schemes, the replacement for the EU farm subsidy system, should be laid out in detail this year, the review recommends, which will come as a relief to farmers concerned about the vagueness of current government plans. Nature-based solutions, which help to increase the UK’s carbon sinks, should also be encouraged. The review also calls for a biomass strategy, without setting out what should be in it. Research and development By this autumn, the government should set out how to create incentives for research and development into new low-CO2 technologies. Three new demonstrator projects should be established. Finance The UK could become “the most competitive financial centre” for raising capital for the green transition, so the government should review opportunities for the banking sector and how to encourage investment. There should also be clear rules on how companies should report their climate impacts. What was missing? Onshore wind and solar farms The review suggests taskforces should be set up for the deployment of onshore wind and solar power, rather than calling for clear targets on onshore windfarms and solar farms in England. These have been controversial questions, as some Tory MPs are opposed to onshore windfarms – despite widespread public support for them – and solar farms. Insulation and home heating Although home heating accounts for 14% of the UK’s emissions, and is one of the biggest cost-of-living concerns amid soaring gas prices, the review stops well short of recommending the sort of nationwide house-by-house programme of upgrades that campaigners have been calling for, or setting out clear options on how to encourage homeowners to upgrade their energy efficiency. No new gas boilers should be installed from 2033, the review said, but that is just two years earlier than the government’s current target of 2035. Those hoping for a clear endorsement of hydrogen for home heating, however – which some hydrogen companies and Tory MPs want but which economists and energy experts say is uneconomic and physically unviable – will also have been disappointed. While not ruling out hydrogen for home heating, the review is notably lukewarm: by the end of this year, the government should update its analysis of hydrogen for home heating “to ensure that the case for economic optimality and feasibility still holds”. Behaviour change To meet the UK’s net zero targets, people will have to change their behaviour, from driving less to eating less meat. These changes should be healthier and better for most of us, but they will require some effort. There are recommendations on eco-labelling and a CO2 calculator for consumers, but beyond that, the review has nothing to say on how consumer behaviour should change, or how the government should encourage behaviour change. Transport Emissions from transport have scarcely budged in a decade, and it is now the biggest single contributor to the UK’s carbon footprint. Yet the review gives a scant five recommendations on the issue, two of which are for shipping and aviation. Public transport merits not a single recommendation, reflecting the absence of government strategy on the subject. On electric vehicles, the report recommends equalising VAT on public and private electric vehicle chargings – useful, perhaps, but not likely to have any significant impact. Meanwhile, why is there is no mention of the rollout of a nationwide system of charging points experts say is needed? Verdict What seeks to be a comprehensive review actually contains huge gaps, reflecting the Tory party’s seeming paralysis over basic issues that need to be grasped, from finding a way to finance the insulation British housing desperately needs, to building out onshore wind, and the absence of any real plan for transport or behaviour change. As a basis for action, this report passes too many bucks to be truly effective – but as an assessment of the government’s failures by a party loyalist, it is devastating.",

                    "body": "<p>This year marks the centenary of Britain’s top mechanical celebrity: the Flying Scotsman locomotive. It emerged from the Doncaster works of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923 and is celebrating its anniversary with an <a href=\"https://www.railwaymuseum.org.uk/whats-on/flying-scotsman-centenary-celebration\">exhibition at the National Railway Museum</a> in York, special excursions and visits to heritage railways around the country.</p> <p>Scotsman is often described as an icon, but what exactly does it represent? I would say early British PR. There were Flying Scotsman ashtrays, jigsaws and paperweights – and the loco often hauled the train of nearly the same name, the Flying Scotsman (train names being preceded by the definite article), which was glamourised by the LNER, with its onboard barber, cinema carriage and Louis XIV-style restaurant car. But why all the glitz?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"980d8f3d883f86d058288d5588423395736bd855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/980d8f3d883f86d058288d5588423395736bd855/0_38_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The name plate for the Flying Scotsman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The name plate for the Flying Scotsman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LNER, like most showoffs, was insecure. The main transport trend during the interwar heyday of the Flying Scotsman was the rise of the internal combustion engine. For the first time, trains were not necessarily top dog in the transport world, hence the paranoid slogan that began to appear on LNER posters: “It’s Quicker By Rail”. As Bob Gwynne, author of a book on the loco, puts it: “The Scotsman campaign was partly meant to lend a warm glow to the railways in general.”</p> <p>In that sense, the Flying Scotsman was an <em>anti-car</em> icon, which gives it in retrospect environmental credibility. And while most of its centenary events are sold out, you can see evidence of the railways’ historical battle against the roads on any visit to Britain’s heritage railways.</p> <h2>North Yorkshire Moors Railway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d396f9a40646a09098aa613a0484650e4ab45ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d396f9a40646a09098aa613a0484650e4ab45ac0/0_64_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Yorkshire Moors Railway Credit Graham Staples or NYMR\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eighteen miles of the NYMR were reopened in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Staples/NYMR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nymr.co.uk/\">NYMR</a> is – like many heritage railways – a line restored by volunteers after being closed by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s. Beeching was installed as British Railways chairman by the Conservative transport minister Ernest “Ernie” Marples – a <a href=\"https://flashbak.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-ernest-marples-mp-455068/\">veritable Dick Dastardly</a>, if you’re a rail fan. Marples drove a Jag and founded a company that built roads. He encouraged Beeching (a physicist) to take a “scientific” approach to Britain’s railways, which turned out to mean slashing the network by a third without regard for the utility of a line, or indeed its beauty – and the one through the wild North York Moors from Whitby to Pickering was particularly beautiful.</p> <p>Eighteen miles of it – from Grosmont to Pickering – were reopened in 1966, and the NYMR runs some luxurious teak carriages hauled by the old LNER expresses, including one that featured on The Flying Scotsman<em> </em>train. These carriages, with their art deco mirrors and plush seats, were boudoir-like to seduce wealthy business travellers away from the new trunk roads. Their mellow, tawny interiors are complemented by the russet shades of the hillside bracken in winter or a moorland sunset at any time of year.</p> <p>The NYMR runs specially adapted steam trains from Grosmont to the gracious, waterfront station at Whitby, which is on the national network.</p> <h2>Strathspey Railway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ff24349ee6c7b7aa385b01ffe87337ae499afd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ff24349ee6c7b7aa385b01ffe87337ae499afd/0_182_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strathspey railway in Aviemore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aviemore on the Strathspey Railway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aviemore’s pretty chalet-like station is on the Highland main line. But there’s a very prominent petrol station nearby, and on a sunny day the town, with its low-rise architecture and wide car parks under big skies, has something of an LA feel about it – a reminder that the Highlands are a magnet for motorists. Since 1978, the <a href=\"https://www.strathspeyrailway.co.uk/\">Strathspey Railway</a> – which revives a stretch of the old Perth-Inverness (via Aviemore) line closed by Beeching – has been a corrective to that.</p> <p>The line runs through the Cairngorms national park, and the SR website states: “We are delighted to welcome customers with bicycles or dogs.” When I was last on platform 3 of Aviemore station, where the SR is based, there were plenty of both, sometimes with a fishing rod thrown in. As our journey began, the adjacent fields and woods of birch or pine were sun-dappled, but a purplish haze over the Cairngorms to the west indicated heavy rain. “Oh,” said the train guard, “there’s usually about five types of weather going on there at once.”</p> <h2>Swanage Railway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae471e653a2fe1c30225ecf1f339f5caed2c03a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae471e653a2fe1c30225ecf1f339f5caed2c03a1/0_58_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus - Fri Jul 17, 2020Fireman Alexander Atkins cleans a Swanage Railway headboard, as final preparations are made at the Swanage Railway ahead of the running of steam trains for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown in March.

                    "bodyText": "This year marks the centenary of Britain’s top mechanical celebrity: the Flying Scotsman locomotive. It emerged from the Doncaster works of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923 and is celebrating its anniversary with an exhibition at the National Railway Museum in York, special excursions and visits to heritage railways around the country. Scotsman is often described as an icon, but what exactly does it represent? I would say early British PR. There were Flying Scotsman ashtrays, jigsaws and paperweights – and the loco often hauled the train of nearly the same name, the Flying Scotsman (train names being preceded by the definite article), which was glamourised by the LNER, with its onboard barber, cinema carriage and Louis XIV-style restaurant car. But why all the glitz? The LNER, like most showoffs, was insecure. The main transport trend during the interwar heyday of the Flying Scotsman was the rise of the internal combustion engine. For the first time, trains were not necessarily top dog in the transport world, hence the paranoid slogan that began to appear on LNER posters: “It’s Quicker By Rail”. As Bob Gwynne, author of a book on the loco, puts it: “The Scotsman campaign was partly meant to lend a warm glow to the railways in general.” In that sense, the Flying Scotsman was an anti-car icon, which gives it in retrospect environmental credibility. And while most of its centenary events are sold out, you can see evidence of the railways’ historical battle against the roads on any visit to Britain’s heritage railways. North Yorkshire Moors Railway The NYMR is – like many heritage railways – a line restored by volunteers after being closed by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s. Beeching was installed as British Railways chairman by the Conservative transport minister Ernest “Ernie” Marples – a veritable Dick Dastardly, if you’re a rail fan. Marples drove a Jag and founded a company that built roads. He encouraged Beeching (a physicist) to take a “scientific” approach to Britain’s railways, which turned out to mean slashing the network by a third without regard for the utility of a line, or indeed its beauty – and the one through the wild North York Moors from Whitby to Pickering was particularly beautiful. Eighteen miles of it – from Grosmont to Pickering – were reopened in 1966, and the NYMR runs some luxurious teak carriages hauled by the old LNER expresses, including one that featured on The Flying Scotsman train. These carriages, with their art deco mirrors and plush seats, were boudoir-like to seduce wealthy business travellers away from the new trunk roads. Their mellow, tawny interiors are complemented by the russet shades of the hillside bracken in winter or a moorland sunset at any time of year. The NYMR runs specially adapted steam trains from Grosmont to the gracious, waterfront station at Whitby, which is on the national network. Strathspey Railway Aviemore’s pretty chalet-like station is on the Highland main line. But there’s a very prominent petrol station nearby, and on a sunny day the town, with its low-rise architecture and wide car parks under big skies, has something of an LA feel about it – a reminder that the Highlands are a magnet for motorists. Since 1978, the Strathspey Railway – which revives a stretch of the old Perth-Inverness (via Aviemore) line closed by Beeching – has been a corrective to that. The line runs through the Cairngorms national park, and the SR website states: “We are delighted to welcome customers with bicycles or dogs.” When I was last on platform 3 of Aviemore station, where the SR is based, there were plenty of both, sometimes with a fishing rod thrown in. As our journey began, the adjacent fields and woods of birch or pine were sun-dappled, but a purplish haze over the Cairngorms to the west indicated heavy rain. “Oh,” said the train guard, “there’s usually about five types of weather going on there at once.” Swanage Railway Beeching had it in for lines to seaside resorts, whose ridership was minimal in the off season. The pretty line to Swanage in Dorset via Corfe Castle appeared to have dodged his axe, but it closed in 1972. It reopened in stages from 1979, the volunteers having to fight off a road expansion scheme. Victorian Swanage was “made” by the railway, and the alliance has been restored. You can’t see the sea from the station but you can hear it when it’s rough, and when it’s calm the genteel station announcements are audible from much of the town. In BR Southern Region green, the station is redolent of that 1950s seaside innocence that Beeching assailed. It displays vintage posters featuring bathing beauties with permed hair and slogans aimed at the automotive enemy: “Arrive Earlier by Train”. Some SR services connect to Wareham on the national network. Ecclesbourne Valley Railway The Ecclesbourne Valley line in Derbyshire closed to passengers in 1947, but the track was used to test diesel multiple units, seen as key to the cheap operation of country branches being menaced by cars. Today, the star attraction of the EVR (reopened in 2002) is a single unit from the first generation of those early diesels – the Derby Lightweights, which are as endearing as their name suggests. The unit is dark green, with straw-coloured “speed whiskers” painted on the front – a kind of go-faster stripe that actually suggests the moustache of a dandified old man. The seat coverings are a lovely, paler green, and all this verdancy harmonises restfully with the gently rolling hillsides and the small but dignified Victorian stations. The EVR shares Duffield station with the somewhat brasher units of the Midland main line. Kent and East Sussex Railway This line opened in 1900, serving farms. It closed in 1961 and was revived from 1974. It was a “Colonel Stephens railway”, meaning it was part of the empire of country lines built on the cheap by the maverick Colonel Holman Fred Stephens. A typical Stephens line was not fenced off but would just wander through a field. A station might be nothing more than an old carriage; signals were usually dispensed with. At its Tenterden terminus (accessible by bus from Ashford or Headcorn mainline stations), the K&amp;ES has a fascinating museum dedicated to the colonel. There’s a waxwork of him sitting at his desk – a hawklike, formidably moustachioed man. He looked like a cad, but he fought the good fight – against the car. Posters around the K&amp;ES carry his peremptory slogans: “Travel in safety across the country, away from the dusty and crowded roads”, or simply: “Travel back in time”. You can do just that on the trains of the K&amp;ES, which are no more disruptive of the sleepy Kentish Weald than the adjacent River Rother. Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway As mentioned, most of the Scotsman centenary events are sold out – but if you travel to the RH&amp;D in Kent (accessible by bus from Folkestone, Ashford or Canterbury), you can see some 1920s locos modelled after Scotsman, but one-third the size. One is called Green Goddess, another Southern Maid. You might see their drivers polishing their boilers prior to setting off from Hythe, running behind sea-facing bungalows towards the great grey beach (and nuclear power stations) at Dungeness – a setting that makes this 15-inch gauge line even more dreamlike. The question of whether it is a heritage railway is moot, since it has been operating more or less continuously since 1927 and it’s not just a pleasure line. Local people can buy shares in the railway, thus getting discounted travel for car-free shopping in Hythe. So even though it was founded by a motor racing enthusiast, Captain Jack Howey, the RH&amp;D fights the good fight. Andrew Martin is the author of Steam Trains Today (Profile, £9.99).",

Putin described the talks as “very productive” and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-drone-strike-on-kyiv-uk-to-announce-new-artillery-package?page=with:block-63a0b1428f0834f3c057c929#block-63a0b1428f0834f3c057c929\">insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, </a>adding that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. Lukashenko said high level Belarusian-Russian negotiations covered “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. </strong>The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the

<li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally.</strong> “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/19/belarus-ukraine-war-putin-meets-lukashenko\">said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military

According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine said Russian shelling targeted the southern city of Kherson on Sunday</strong>, which has faced repeated attacks since Kyiv’s forces recaptured it last month. “Another blow was delivered to the city centre. Three people were injured. They received shrapnel wounds, one wounded is in a serious condition,” deputy head of the president’s office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. Regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Sunday that Moscow’s troops had carried out 54 attacks on Kherson region with artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks and mortars over the previous day, leaving three dead and wounding six others.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday</strong>, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/world/video/2022/dec/18/drone-video-shows-explosions-bakhmut-eastern-ukraine-video\">heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut</a></strong>, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/mi-gotuyemo-ciyeyi-zimi-specialnij-samit-zaradi-miru-j-zapro-79949\">address</a>. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Power has been restored to three million more Ukrainians after the latest Russian attacks on infrastructure</strong>, bringing the total to nine million after two days, Ukraine’s president has said. “Electricity supplies have been restored to a further three million Ukrainians,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Sunday evening video <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/mi-gotuyemo-ciyeyi-zimi-specialnij-samit-zaradi-miru-j-zapro-79949\">address</a>. “That means after the terrorist strikes on Friday, we have results already for nine million of our people.” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/18/kyiv-mayor-says-heating-restored-in-capital-after-latest-russian-strikes\">Heating has also been fully restored to Kyiv</a>, the city’s mayor said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Protecting Ukraine’s borders is a “constant priority” as the country readies for all possible scenarios with Russia and its ally Belarus</strong>, Zelenskiy added. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus – is our constant priority,” he said in his nightly video address. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Zelenskiy also issued a new appeal to western nations to provide Ukraine with effective air defences.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia will reportedly deploy musicians to Ukraine’s frontlines in a bid to boost morale</strong>, according to its defence ministry. The “frontline creative brigade” will be tasked with maintaining “a high moral, political and psychological state [among] the participants of the special military operation,” Russian outlet RBC news cited the ministry as saying. UK defence officials said the new unit is in keeping with the historic use of “military music and organised entertainment” to boost morale as low morale continues to be a “significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Iran’s foreign ministry has said it will not “seek permission from anyone” to expand relations with Russia</strong>, dismissing US concerns over a growing military partnership between Tehran and Moscow. Iran has been accused of supplying drones to Russia, allegedly used to attack Ukraine. CIA chief William Burns said the military cooperation between Iran and Russia “poses real threats” to US allies in the Middle East. Nasser Kanani, spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry, called the comments “baseless” adding that Tehran “acts independently in regulating its foreign relations and does not seek permission from anyone”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger believes the time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine</strong>. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, h owever expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” he added. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed the comments as amounting to “appeasing the aggressor” and said there could be no deal involving ceding territory. “Any agreement with the devil – a bad peace at the expense of Ukrainian territories – will be a victory for Putin and a recipe for success for autocrats around the world,” he said in a <a href=\"https://t.me/M_Podolyak/118\">statement</a> on Telegram.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff068a68944c195ff5281146863b4434af5bf68d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff068a68944c195ff5281146863b4434af5bf68d/0_49_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman walks on an empty street in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on 18 December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks on an empty street in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on 18 December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>",

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Putin described the talks as “very productive” and insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, adding that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. Lukashenko said high level Belarusian-Russian negotiations covered “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’s foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’s defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military command. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks”. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata said, adding that his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after Sunday midnight. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes after the alert. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut in the country’s eastern Donetsk region, according to Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. EU ministers have agreed a plan to cap the price of gas, ending months of argument over how to handle the cost of soaring energy prices after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. A gas price cap will kick in if prices on the main European gas exchange, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), exceed €180 (£157) a megawatt-hour for three consecutive working days, far lower than the European Commission’s original proposal of €275 a MWh, which had been derided by cap-supporting countries as a joke. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. Vladimir Putin has described Russian-Belarusian talks in Minsk as “very productive” after his one-on-one meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, Belarusian state media reported. Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with his Belarusian counterpart, Putin insisted that Russia has no interest in “absorbing” anyone, and that unspecified “enemies” wanted to stop Russia’s integration with Belarus. The future of Belarusian and Russian peoples “is being determined now”, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta cited President Lukashenko as saying. He added: Today we can unequivocally state: together we were able not only to survive, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies. He said negotiations of the two leaders with larger government delegations in Minsk had been productive, and said they discussed “the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, according to Belta. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he believes Russia’s war in Ukraine “will go on” and does not see a prospect for “serious” peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he “will not relent in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine in line with international law and the United Nations Charter”, referring to the UN charter’s key principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said he was “not optimistic” about the possibility of effective Ukraine and Russia peace talks in the immediate future, adding: I do believe that the military confrontation will go on. Nevertheless, he said he “strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the “consequences” for Ukraine’s people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found. He added: All these are reasons for us to do everything possible to make a peace solution happen before the end of 2023. In the meantime, he said he would focus on increasing the efficiency of a UN-brokered deal that resumed Ukraine’s Black Sea food and fertiliser shipments, continue to try to restart the export of Russian ammonia via Ukraine and seek to accelerate the exchange of prisoners of war. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Minsk, where Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has been holding talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. The head of Moldova’s security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east, echoing recent messages from several Ukrainian military commanders that Moscow is preparing for a major new offensive early next year. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata told the TVR-Moldova television channel, as reported by Reuters. Musteata said: The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldova’s territory, but when it will do so. He said his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot, borders western Ukraine. Musteata said Russia wanted its forces to link up with those forces in Transnistria. Boris Johnson’s Ukraine policy may not have always been sophisticated – “Dobryi den, everybody!” – but his enthusiasm was welcomed in Kyiv. Six months of Conservative party chaos later, his successor but one, Rishi Sunak, is yet to demonstrate he is as supportive at a time when Ukraine needs the west to dig in. A leak at the start of the weekend said that Sunak had ordered an internal assessment of the significance of British military aid to Ukraine. Revelation of the Whitehall exercise was accompanied by a pointed briefing to the BBC, accusing the prime minister of resorting to a “Goldman Sachs dashboard” approach. “Wars aren’t won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct,” the critic continued – a demonstration that cracks are appearing in Britain’s policy towards Ukraine. Downing Street may have rejected that characterisation on Monday, but a Ukraine review is on. “The PM is staying closely across the detail of developments in Ukraine and the impact of UK and international support,” a spokesperson said. “To ensure we are delivering the best possible assistance.” It is also no secret in Westminster that Sunak and his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are not close. Wallace has been the ever present in Britain’s Ukraine policy, but also a long-term supporter of Johnson who then backed the ill-fated Liz Truss and flirted with backing Johnson in an unlikely comeback against Sunak. Read the full story here: EU ministers have reached an agreement to cap gas prices, after weeks of talks and despite concerns that such an intervention could cause greater volatility in the market. Ministers agreed to trigger a cap if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the deal “means the end of market manipulation” by Russia and its energy giant Gazprom. The European Commission stands ready to suspend the agreed price cap if an analysis by regulators shows the risks of the measure outweigh the benefits, the bloc’s energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told reporters. The exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine “may increase in coming weeks” as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing for its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. Tsikhanouskaya’s remarks came as Vladimir Putin travelled to Belarus for talks with Alexander Lukashenko, a meeting that the Belarusian president said would cover the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders said Russia might try another attempt at invading the country from the north. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. Kyiv was “right to prepare” for Minsk to join Moscow’s new offensive because the probability “might increase in coming weeks”, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. She said: Belarusian armed forces are part of the society and share the same view on the war – 86% of Belarusians are against participation in the war. This has stopped the order to send Belarusian troops to the battlefield in Ukraine. It was not a good will of dictators or Lukashenko’s standing up to Putin – he is fully on the Kremlin’s side. However, the probability of such an order remains and might increase in coming weeks. I think the Ukrainian leadership is right to prepare for this scenario even though it means distracting significant forces from active war zones in the south-east. Lukashenko “sees Ukraine as a threat”, she said, adding that “a democratic, free, European Ukraine is a bad example to the dictatorships of Lukashenko and Putin, therefore this war is a logical decision for them.” Asked what Russia and Belarus’ join aim might be, she replied: To destroy Ukraine, its European aspirations and national identity, and bring it under their control. The Canadian government has announced plans to seize $26m in sanctioned assets from the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds from the forfeiture to go towards reconstruction in Ukraine and compensation of victims of the Russian invasion. The move marked the first case of the Canadian government using new powers to pursue the seizure of assets belonging to sanctioned individuals, it said in a statement. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said the government would “continue to pressure the Russian regime and those who have benefited from Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine”. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’s foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’s defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraine’s top military command. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Berlin had “concerns” about Putin’s visit to Belarus and whether talks between the Russian and Belarusian presidents will impact Minsk’s role in the war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said. Steffen Hebestreit said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after Sunday midnight. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes after the alert. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut in the country’s eastern Donetsk region, according to Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut, the UK Ministry of Defence said. In recent months, the group had developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry noted in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders “to do everything to accelerate the defeat” of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be “one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now”. Germany has “concerns” about Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus and whether talks between the Russian leader and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, will affect Minsk’s role in the war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said. Speaking at a briefing this afternoon, Steffen Hebestreit told reporters that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was fully aware of Putin’s visit to Belarus today, Ukraine’s state-run news agency Ukrinform reported. Hebestreit said: Of course, there are concerns about what this visit might entail: whether the role of Belarus in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine will once again change or be modified. He said there was a possibility that Belarus could ramp up aid to the Russian army, but warned to wait for the results of the talks and not to draw any conclusions in advance. EU energy ministers have agreed to a gas price cap, a spokesperson for the Czech presidency of the EU, Dmitrij Černikov, has said. Vladimir Putin said Belarus was Russia’s closest ally in brief remarks during visit to Minsk to hold talks with Alexander Lukashenko. The Belarusian media outlet Nexta has a clip of the Russian and Belarusian presidents as they began the open part of their negotiations. In comments published by Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass, Putin said Moscow was ready to continue helping Minsk to develop its nuclear industry. Putin was quoted as saying at talks with Lukashenko: We are intensively working in almost all areas. In the energy sector – as we noted with [Belarusian president] Alexander Grigorievich [Lukashenko], Russia, to its own detriment, nevertheless continues the nuclear project – we are building a nuclear power plant. A resident walks past a damaged house following a barrage of drone strikes from Russia in Stari Bezradychi village, Kyiv region. Rishi Sunak praised the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force’s support of Ukraine as “heartening” in a meeting with Latvia’s prime minister. Speaking at the start of their bilateral at the close of the alliance’s summit in Riga, the UK prime minister told Krišjānis Kariņš: To have a group of partners and allies who think so alike on these incredibly important questions of our connected security, and then are backing up those sentiments with action when it comes to supporting Ukraine, I think is very heartening. Kariņš replied: I think you nailed it when you made that comment to all of us around the table: ‘it’s not just talk, it’s also the walk’. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine’s Kyiv region, in the aftermath of a Russian drone attack in the early hours of Monday. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency has accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after midnight. Writing on Telegram, Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected early Monday over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. Energoatom said: This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of nuclear and radiation safety. The agency called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. It has been possible to independently verify these claims. Vladimir Putin has landed in Minsk for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, Russian state media reported, amid growing fears that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. The Russian leader’s trip will be his first to Minsk since 2019, and comes as he has been taking a more public role in his war in Ukraine. Lukashenko has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times even subtly criticising the invasion, saying he felt the conflict was “dragging on”. Speaking to Russian news agencies, the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Belarus was Russia’s “number one ally”, but that suggestions that Moscow wanted to pressure Minsk into joining what it calls its “special military operation” were “stupid and unfounded fabrications”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier today ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Belarus. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’ foreign ministry as saying. The pair also “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”, the ministry said. Rishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply” at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson. Rejecting Russian-promoted ceasefires has been the west’s position for some time – but reiterations of the position are welcome in Kyiv, given its anxiety that the west could eventually lose interest in the war in Ukraine and slow the supply of weapons the country so badly needs. A call to prevent Russia from regrouping indicates Britain endorses Ukraine’s ongoing counter offensive, and comes the morning after the UK said it would ship hundreds of thousands more of artillery shells to Kyiv, under a £250m contract. EU energy ministers are meeting in Brussels today to attempt to agree to a cap on gas prices, following months of debate without agreement despite two emergency meetings. Ministers are considering a new compromise proposed by the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, according to Reuters. In the draft proposal, a cap would be triggered if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hub’s front-month contract exceed €180 (£157) per megawatt hour for three days. The figure in the draft proposal, seen by the news agency, is far lower than the €275/MWh originally proposed by the European Commission last month, which about a dozen countries including Belgium, Poland and Greece had dismissed as too high. Pro-cap countries say the cap must be below €200/MWh to tackle the high gas prices that have inflated citizens’ energy bills and stoked record-high inflation. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose the cap, which they say could disrupt Europe’s energy markets and divert much-needed gas cargoes away from the EU and to other regions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, travels to Belarus on Monday to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the run-up to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said that the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. The longtime Belarusian strongman, who oversaw a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2020, stressed that his country’s “sovereignty and independence” was not up for debate, as observers believe that Putin’s visit serves to pull Belarus into the war in Ukraine. “I would like to emphasise this feature once again: no one, except us, governs Belarus,” Lukashenko said in a statement published by the presidential press service. We must always proceed from the fact that we are a sovereign state and independent. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders warned Russia may try another attempt at invading the country from the north. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday said that Ukraine was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,” Zelenskiy said after a meeting on Sunday with Ukraine’s top military command. We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios. Read the full story here: Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has said Ukraine will “neither surrender nor fulfil” Russia’s ultimatums. The end to the conflict “can only be accelerated by increasing artillery/tanks supply”, he wrote in a post on Twitter directed at western leaders. An air raid alert has been issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine, according to officials. A statement by the Kyiv regional military administration reads: Air alarm in the Kyiv region. Stay tuned for further posts. Deutsche Welle’s Emmanuelle Chaze shares a map of where air sirens have sounded in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. Addressing a meeting in Riga of leaders of countries in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which includes Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Zelenskiy said: Russian aggression can and must fail. The task now is to make sure it happens faster. I call upon you to do everything to accelerate the defeat of the occupiers. Millions had been left without heat and water after Russia launched further attacks using Iranian drones last night, he said. He continued: May I ask you to increase the possibility of supplying air defence systems to our country ... 100% air shield for Ukraine, that would be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s air force says it shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight.

One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor told Reuters. Belarus’ defence ministry said on Monday it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of a visit to Minsk by Belarus’ most important ally, the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again, Reuters reported. Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is due to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. EU countries will need to reach a compromise on a gas price cap on Monday, and the latest proposal on the table offers a good basis to do so, Malta’s energy minister, Miriam Dalli, has said. “What the presidency is proposing is a very good step in the right direction,” Dalli said before entering a meeting of the EU’s energy ministers. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Rishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression. The UK prime minister landed in snowy Riga at 11.20am local time, stepping out of the plane into a gusty -4C, PA Media reported. He will urge fellow leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force to stand firm in their support for Ukraine, after announcing a major new artillery package for the war-torn nation. He will continue his whistlestop tour by flying to Estonia later on Monday, where he will meet British troops and sign a new technology partnership. Russia’s drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said.

I’m convinced that today we will mange to compromise, I believe that the willingness is there. Today is crunch time.” Critical power infrastructure burns after a drone attack in Kyiv this morning Ukraine’s air force says it shot down 30 out of 35 Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added. Russian troops that were moved to Belarus in October to become part of a regional formation will conduct battalion tactical exercises, the Russian Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing the Russian defence ministry. Interfax cited the ministry’s statement as saying: The final assessment of the combat capability and combat readiness of the units will be given by the command at the final stage of coordination – after the battalion tactical exercises have been conducted.” It was not immediately clear when and where in Belarus the exercises will be conducted. Belarus defence ministry said in October that 9,000 Russian troops were moving to the country as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is set to fly to Belarus on Monday amid fears he intends to pressure the former Soviet ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine and open a new front. His visit for talks with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will be his first to Minsk since 2019. Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said: During (these talks) questions will be worked out for further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground.” Ukraine’s top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring. There has been constant Russian and Belarusian military activity for months in Belarus. Russia also used its ally as a launch pad for an abortive attack on Kyiv in February. Moscow and Minsk have since set up a joint regional unit of forces in Belarus and held numerous military exercises. Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week. Foreign diplomats say Lukashenko, a pariah in the west who relies heavily on Russian support, understands it would be a deeply unpopular step at home for him to commit troops to Ukraine. But he has already supported Russia’s war extensively. Some military analysts see the manoeuvring as a ploy to make Ukraine commit forces to its north so it is more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere. The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. The prime minister will travel to Latvia for the leaders’ gathering of Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) countries, including Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands, which will be addressed by Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenksiy. From the Arctic Circle to the Isle of Wight, the UK and our European allies have been in lockstep in our response to the invasion of Ukraine, and we remain steadfast in our ambition for peace in Europe once again,” Sunak said ahead of the visit. But to achieve peace, we must deter aggression and our deployments across the region together are vital in ensuring we are able to respond to the gravest of threats. I know this Joint Expeditionary Force summit will only underline our close friendships and unwavering support for Ukraine.” No 10 said the meeting would also discuss intelligence sharing between JEF countries, threats to infrastructure and hybrid threats posed by Russian aggression and bolstering support to Finland and Sweden ahead of their accession to Nato. Further announcements on joint military exercises are also expected. Sunak is then expected to fly on to Estonia, where he will meet UK and Nato troops serving on the military alliance’s eastern flank on the Russian border. New information published by Ukrainian authorities suggests that Russia’s earlier drone attack on Kyiv damaged critical infrastructure and injured two people. Kyiv’s regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, wrote on Telegram this morning: Infrastructure objects and private houses were damaged as a result of a night drone attack in the Kyiv region … two victims. People are given help – they are under the supervision of doctors.” Russian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In recent months, the group has developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited, the ministry notes in its latest intelligence report. Individual fighters are likely issued a smart phone or tablet which shows the individual’s designated axis of advance and assault objective superimposed on commercial satellite imagery. At platoon level and above, commanders likely remain in cover and give orders over radios, informed by video feeds from small un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Individuals and sections are ordered to proceed on the preplanned route, often with fire-support, but less often alongside armoured vehicles. Wagner operatives who deviate from their assault routes without authorisation are likely being threatened with summary execution. These brutal tactics aim to conserve Wagner’s rare assets of experienced commanders and armoured vehicles, at the expense of the more readily available convict-recruits, which the organisation assesses as expendable.” At least two powerful explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital in the early hours of Monday morning, as officials claim the city was hit by a series of Russian drones. Multiple local news sources reported the blasts in central Kyiv. Several loud blasts were also heard in the city’s surrounding regions, Reuters witnesses reported. A fire was also reported in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district. Ukraine’s armed forces first sounded the alarm in a Telegram alert about 2am local time, saying the military had sent air defences to protect the capital from drone attacks. The Kyiv city state administration also sent an alert urging residents to seek shelter. It later added that more than 20 Iranian-made drones were detected over Kyiv’s air space and at least 15 of them were shot down. Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv regional military administration, said air defence works were operating in the region and claimed the city was under a drone attack. The drone attack continues,” he said. Kyiv’s military administration later said that nine Iranian-made Shahed drones were shot down in Kyiv’s airspace. In a Telegram update, the administration said: Air alert continues in Kyiv. The enemy is attacking the capital with ‘Shahed’ barrage ammunition. Air defence is being at work.” It was not immediately clear whether the blasts were air defence systems destroying the drones or hitting targets. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. A series of explosions have rocked Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in the early hours of this morning, according to regional officials. Meanwhile, the UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. According to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office and as cited by Agence France-Presse, he will announce Britain’s intention to supply “hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition next year under a £250m ($304m) contract that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023”. Ukraine said Russian shelling targeted the southern city of Kherson on Sunday, which has faced repeated attacks since Kyiv’s forces recaptured it last month. “Another blow was delivered to the city centre. Three people were injured. They received shrapnel wounds, one wounded is in a serious condition,” deputy head of the president’s office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. Regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Sunday that Moscow’s troops had carried out 54 attacks on Kherson region with artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, tanks and mortars over the previous day, leaving three dead and wounding six others. Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were reportedly wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said. Witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” Power has been restored to three million more Ukrainians after the latest Russian attacks on infrastructure, bringing the total to nine million after two days, Ukraine’s president has said. “Electricity supplies have been restored to a further three million Ukrainians,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Sunday evening video address. “That means after the terrorist strikes on Friday, we have results already for nine million of our people.” Heating has also been fully restored to Kyiv, the city’s mayor said. Protecting Ukraine’s borders is a “constant priority” as the country readies for all possible scenarios with Russia and its ally Belarus, Zelenskiy added. “Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus – is our constant priority,” he said in his nightly video address. “We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.” Zelenskiy also issued a new appeal to western nations to provide Ukraine with effective air defences. Russia will reportedly deploy musicians to Ukraine’s frontlines in a bid to boost morale, according to its defence ministry. The “frontline creative brigade” will be tasked with maintaining “a high moral, political and psychological state [among] the participants of the special military operation,” Russian outlet RBC news cited the ministry as saying. UK defence officials said the new unit is in keeping with the historic use of “military music and organised entertainment” to boost morale as low morale continues to be a “significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force”. Iran’s foreign ministry has said it will not “seek permission from anyone” to expand relations with Russia, dismissing US concerns over a growing military partnership between Tehran and Moscow. Iran has been accused of supplying drones to Russia, allegedly used to attack Ukraine. CIA chief William Burns said the military cooperation between Iran and Russia “poses real threats” to US allies in the Middle East. Nasser Kanani, spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry, called the comments “baseless” adding that Tehran “acts independently in regulating its foreign relations and does not seek permission from anyone”. Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger believes the time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, h owever expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” he added. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed the comments as amounting to “appeasing the aggressor” and said there could be no deal involving ceding territory. “Any agreement with the devil – a bad peace at the expense of Ukrainian territories – will be a victory for Putin and a recipe for success for autocrats around the world,” he said in a statement on Telegram.",

The hot and dry weather has worsened the drought issues across the region, with many water reservoirs recording extremely low levels of storage at the start of the summer season, following a very dry winter (especially January/February) and a very dry May too. Spain generates more than 10% of its electricity from hydropower plants, so this will have some serious implications for energy production and availability/prices. The dry and hot conditions are moving eastwards through the rest of this week and into the weekend, across north-western and central Europe, before reaching further north and east into eastern Europe through the weekend and into the following week. Temperatures are expected to reach into the 30s across many areas, peaking at between 7-10C above the seasonal normal in some locations. The heatwave will lead to a surge in energy demand for cooling across some parts of Europe, and will also increase the river water temperatures used for cooling nuclear power plants across the continent. In the past, France’s EDF had to halt some of their nuclear reactors due to the heat and the rising Rhone River temperatures, although this is more common in July and August rather than mid-June. On the other side of the Atlantic, since the beginning of June, large swathes of central and eastern US have experienced mostly seasonal conditions, with western parts of the American continent facing the hottest and driest conditions so far. However, a change is coming through this week as heat is building across the central plains and expanding eastwards, with this likely to lead to some unseasonably hot weather through the first half of this week with many temperature records being challenged.

It was the first major city to fall to Vladimir Putin’s forces, and remains the only regional capital to have done so. With the failure of the Russian plan for a lightning victory increasingly evident, and humiliating, the city’s capture was important for Moscow for symbolic as well as strategic reasons. Many of its 280,000 inhabitants remained not only angry but defiant, mounting protests in its centre. But the gruelling impact of Russian occupation has taken its toll. The protests were suppressed by troops. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/27/tavriya-tv-will-promote-happiness-love-russia-opens-station-occupied-kherson\" title=\"\">crackdown on dissent</a> has been ruthless and thorough. A Russian curriculum has been imposed in schools.</p> <p>So Monday’s declaration by a Ukrainian military official that a long-anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/zelenskiy-tells-russian-forces-to-flee-as-ukraine-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson\" title=\"\">southern counterattack</a> had begun was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/ukraine-claims-counteroffensive-south-russia-explained\" title=\"\">striking moment</a> six months into this war. Ukraine’s southern command declared that Russia had suffered heavy losses of personnel and equipment (while Russia’s defence ministry claimed that it had inflicted severe losses on the Ukrainians). Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, claimed that troops had broken through Russian defences in several areas near Kherson – yet was also keen to manage expectations, portraying a “slow operation to grind the enemy”.</p> <p>The extent of the pushback is far from clear. One Ukrainian official described “normal operations”, and some fighters have suggested that the attacks fall short of a full counteroffensive. Partisan attacks <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/18/life-in-occupied-kherson-is-grim\" title=\"\">were already occurring</a>. Despite the flow of arms from the US especially, Ukraine remains very short of weapons and personnel to attempt a major assault. Some wondered if trailing a counteroffensive so heavily in advance was designed to try to distract Russia from the east, where it has been advancing, albeit slowly. The US military said on Monday that there was an uptick in fighting around Kherson, but could not confirm whether an offensive had begun.</p> <p>The former head of MI6 Sir Alex Younger spoke not in military terms but of a “key psychological moment” when interviewed by the BBC, and talked not about place but time. Russian occupation is having an incremental effect not only on the wellbeing of civilians, but also on the city’s status. The Kremlin plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/ukraine-kherson-region-referendum-russia\" title=\"\">a referendum</a> to create the pretext for bringing the region into Russia, despite minimal enthusiasm; Ukraine may hope to postpone the vote. In logistical terms, bitter winter conditions are also likely to entrench the military stalemate.</p> <p>But Sir Alex was pointing to Kyiv’s need to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population, as it faces a grim winter, and maintaining the support of western leaders, whose own voters are struggling with soaring energy costs. As he discussed the development, EU defence ministers meeting in Prague were expected to approve plans for a training facility for Ukrainian troops, but finance ministers remained divided over hitting Russia further.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\" title=\"\">humanitarian crisis is growing</a>. Unable to make swift military progress, Russia may have shifted focus towards formalising annexation and to economic punishment. Kyiv fears Russia could target its energy grid and turn off the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/ukraine-says-it-will-target-russian-soldiers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant\" title=\"\">Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station</a>. Some think that as many as 2 million Ukrainians could cross into Poland this winter. As hazy as the military situation remains, its brutal impact on civilians could not be clearer.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Russia took the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, little more than a week after launching its invasion on 24 February. It was the first major city to fall to Vladimir Putin’s forces, and remains the only regional capital to have done so. With the failure of the Russian plan for a lightning victory increasingly evident, and humiliating, the city’s capture was important for Moscow for symbolic as well as strategic reasons. Many of its 280,000 inhabitants remained not only angry but defiant, mounting protests in its centre. But the gruelling impact of Russian occupation has taken its toll. The protests were suppressed by troops. The crackdown on dissent has been ruthless and thorough. A Russian curriculum has been imposed in schools. So Monday’s declaration by a Ukrainian military official that a long-anticipated southern counterattack had begun was a striking moment six months into this war. Ukraine’s southern command declared that Russia had suffered heavy losses of personnel and equipment (while Russia’s defence ministry claimed that it had inflicted severe losses on the Ukrainians). Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed that troops had broken through Russian defences in several areas near Kherson – yet was also keen to manage expectations, portraying a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The extent of the pushback is far from clear. One Ukrainian official described “normal operations”, and some fighters have suggested that the attacks fall short of a full counteroffensive. Partisan attacks were already occurring. Despite the flow of arms from the US especially, Ukraine remains very short of weapons and personnel to attempt a major assault. Some wondered if trailing a counteroffensive so heavily in advance was designed to try to distract Russia from the east, where it has been advancing, albeit slowly. The US military said on Monday that there was an uptick in fighting around Kherson, but could not confirm whether an offensive had begun. The former head of MI6 Sir Alex Younger spoke not in military terms but of a “key psychological moment” when interviewed by the BBC, and talked not about place but time. Russian occupation is having an incremental effect not only on the wellbeing of civilians, but also on the city’s status. The Kremlin plans a referendum to create the pretext for bringing the region into Russia, despite minimal enthusiasm; Ukraine may hope to postpone the vote. In logistical terms, bitter winter conditions are also likely to entrench the military stalemate. But Sir Alex was pointing to Kyiv’s need to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population, as it faces a grim winter, and maintaining the support of western leaders, whose own voters are struggling with soaring energy costs. As he discussed the development, EU defence ministers meeting in Prague were expected to approve plans for a training facility for Ukrainian troops, but finance ministers remained divided over hitting Russia further. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is growing. Unable to make swift military progress, Russia may have shifted focus towards formalising annexation and to economic punishment. Kyiv fears Russia could target its energy grid and turn off the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Some think that as many as 2 million Ukrainians could cross into Poland this winter. As hazy as the military situation remains, its brutal impact on civilians could not be clearer.",

Kim guided exercises by the country’s nuclear tactical operation units over the past two weeks, involving ballistic missiles with mock nuclear warheads, KCNA said, adding that they were meant to deliver a strong deterrent message. “The effectiveness and practical combat capability of our nuclear combat force were fully demonstrated as it stands completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Even though the enemy continues to talk about dialogue and negotiations, we do not have anything to talk about nor do we feel the need to do so.” The various tests simulated targeting military command facilities, striking main ports, and neutralising airports in the South. Tactical nuclear weapons South Korean and US officials say there are signs North Korea could soon detonate a new nuclear device in underground tunnels at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which was officially closed in 2018. Analysts say putting small warheads on short-range missiles could represent a dangerous change in the way North Korea deploys and plans to use nuclear weapons. On 4 October, the North test-fired a ballistic missile farther than ever before, flying what it said was a new intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said North Korea had “multiple motivations” for publicising the launches. “Kim Jong-un’s public appearance after a month-long absence provides a patriotic headline to mark (Monday’s) founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ party,” Easley said. “Pyongyang has been concerned about military exercises by the US, South Korea and Japan, so to strengthen its self-proclaimed deterrent, it is making explicit the nuclear threat behind its recent missile launches,” he added.",

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”. Video footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official showed crowds of Ukrainians forming a barrier between the Russian forces and the nuclear plant, blocking their advance. The interior ministry official, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine has asked the IAEA to declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. Grossi told the IAEA board of governors meeting in Vienna: “It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhihia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them.” The IAEA also said that a feed of radiation data from Zaporizhzhia had been interrupted on Tuesday and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate (SNRIU) was trying to find out the reason for the break and to restore the flow of data. Grossi also raised concern over a report from the SNRIU that since Russians took over the Chernobyl plant, site of the 1986 disaster in north western Ukraine near the Belarus border, the staff there had not been permitted to go home. The US deputy envoy to the IAEA, Louis Bono, said: “The Ukrainian staff at the site have not been allowed to leave and have been forced to work multiple shifts. This added stress on staff performing critical tasks further jeopardizes the safety and security of the site and the public.” In his remarks Grossi said: “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at [the Chernobyl plant] are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,” The remains of the reactor core which exploded in 1986 is buried under concrete at the site, and there are also spent fuel storage facilities and a large amount of radioactive dust in the topsoil of the surrounding area. The churning up of the soil by Russian military vehicles caused limited radiation spikes. In a statement, Energoatom said: “Being in the exclusion zone now and apparently not having the skills to ensure personal safety when working in radioactively contaminated areas, the invaders are exposed to significant external and internal radiation, which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the form of cancer.” On Sunday, the Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had struck the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. The day before, an electrical transformer in another waste facility in Kharkiv was damaged. In both cases there was no radioactive release, but the incidents highlighted the potential threat of ecological disaster from a war underway in a country with an extensive nuclear industry. The American Nuclear Society (ANS), an association of industry professionals, is seeking to send material support to Ukraine to help nuclear workers there. “The staff at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption undue pressure or the fear of being killed or injured,” the ANS said in a statement. “Ukraine’s nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes and a peace of mind that their loved ones are safe. The society’s president, Steven Nesbit, said he hoped that the Russian invaders were aware of the dangers of a nuclear accident. “All I can say is it’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have a sensitivity to the issues here,” Nesbit said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin need to be taking all steps they can to avoid becoming even more of a pariah nation than they have become.”",

Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st independence day, celebrated on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said he had “a great conversation” and thanked Biden for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The Vatican’s Russia-Ukraine diplomacy suffered two setbacks on Thursday when the head of the Russian Orthodox church cancelled a meeting with Pope Francis and Ukraine summoned the papal ambassador to complain about Francis’ latest comments about the war. The pontiff upset Kyiv by including Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian nationalist TV Alexander Dugin killed by a car bomb on Sunday, as among the “innocents” who have been victimised by the “insanity of war.” Russia has accused Ukrainian intelligence in the bombing, which Ukraine denies. Latvia toppled a Soviet-era obelisk amid backlash against Russia. The concrete nearly 80-metre (260ft) obelisk topped by Soviet stars was the centrepiece of a monument to the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany, the latest in a series of Soviet monuments brought down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Lavrov met South Africa’s foreign minister, <strong>Naledi Pandor</strong>, in a trip some opposition parties and the small Ukrainian community in South Africa have condemned as insensitive.

The Guardian was not able to independently verify when and where the video was taken. On 11 January, the private Russian military group Wagner said it had captured Soledar.

Michael said he wanted to explore the idea of managing the Russian central bank’s frozen assets to generate profits, which could then be earmarked for reconstruction efforts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia has said it is downgrading diplomatic relations with the Nato member Estonia</strong>, accusing Tallinn of “total Russophobia”.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock’s comment on Sunday, that her country would not “stand in the way” of Poland sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, is causing some confusion in Berlin. It remains unclear whether her remarks are indicative of a shift in the government’s position. Baerbock did not repeat her comment when pressed on the matter on Monday morning. “It’s important that we as an international community do everything to defend Ukraine, so that Ukraine wins”, she told press at a meeting of the EU’s foreign affairs council in Brussels. “Because if it loses Ukraine will cease to exist”. German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday promised that Germany will “continue to support Ukraine – for as long and as comprehensively as necessary”, adding: “Together, as Europeans – in defence of our European peace project.” Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, plans to visit Ukraine soon, he told a German newspaper. German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said “To this hour we have not received a request.” Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during his visit to South Africa on Monday that Ukraine was rejecting peace talks and the longer this continued, the harder it would be to resolve the conflict. Lavrov met South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in a trip some opposition parties and the small Ukrainian community in South Africa have condemned as insensitive. The South African military is set to host a joint military exercise with Russia and China on its east coast on 17-27 February. 18 people injured as a result of last weekend’s rocket attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro remain in hospital, including one child. Ukraine state broadcaster reports “There are no serious patients among these patients, all of them were transferred from intensive care units to general departments.” Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy in Ukraine’s north-east, has said that an apartment building and railway infrastructure has been hit by Russian fire in Vorozhba. There were no details of casualties. The top Moscow-installed official in the Russian-occupied parts of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine said late on Sunday that he had visited the town of Soledar, which Russia claimed to have captured earlier this month. Denis Pushilin published a short video on the Telegram messaging app that showed him driving and walking amid desolate areas and destroyed buildings. The Guardian was not able to independently verify when and where the video was taken. On 11 January, the private Russian military group Wagner said it had captured Soledar. Ukraine has never publicly said that the town was taken by Russian forces. Russia claimed to have made advances in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region. After months of stalemate in the south-eastern region, Moscow-installed officials say the front is now “mobile” while the Ukrainian army reported that 15 settlements had come under artillery fire. “During offensive operations in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, units of the eastern military district took up more advantageous ground and positions,” the defence ministry said on Sunday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that Russian forces claim to have destroyed a large Ukrainian ammunition depot in the Kherson region. Russian secret service the SVR has claimed – without presenting evidence –that Ukraine is storing weapons and ammunition supplied by the west on the territory of nuclear power plants. European Council president Charles Michel has urged the bloc’s national leaders to push forward with talks on using $300bn-worth of confiscated Russian central bank assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine, the Financial Times reports. Michael said he wanted to explore the idea of managing the Russian central bank’s frozen assets to generate profits, which could then be earmarked for reconstruction efforts. Russia has said it is downgrading diplomatic relations with the Nato member Estonia, accusing Tallinn of “total Russophobia”. The Russian foreign ministry said it had told the Estonian envoy he must leave next month, and both countries would be represented in each other’s capitals by an interim charge d’affaires instead of an ambassador. Latvia will downgrade its diplomatic ties with Russia and inform its Russian ambassador to leave the country by 24 February. Russia said on Monday that no new date had been set for talks with the US on the New Start nuclear arms treaty, accusing the US of ramping up tensions between the two sides. A former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner Group who sought asylum in Norway has been told he will be deported, according to a Russian rights group. Andrey Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway near the Pasvikdalen valley earlier this month, where he was arrested and detained by border guards. Medvedev’s lawyer has dismissed the claim, saying “the risk of him being deported? It is zero.” Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine, where he said that it was “the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job”. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak is “supportive” of Boris Johnson’s visit, despite warnings that it would undermine the current prime minister’s authority. Johnson’s visits to Ukraine have often coincided with moments of domestic crisis, and he is currently under pressure over his financial relationship with BBC chairman Richard Sharp. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he does not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to Ukraine. “As for the Leclercs, I have asked the defence ministry to work on it. Nothing is excluded,” he said while speaking at a summit with German chancellor Scholz. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed Ukraine will not tolerate corruption and promised forthcoming key decisions on uprooting it this week. “I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live,” he said in his nightly video address. The EU has made anti-corruption reforms one of its key requirements for Ukraine’s membership to the bloc, after granting Kyiv candidate status last year. Norway’s army chief has estimated 180,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in over the course of the conflict, while the figure for the Ukrainians is 100,000 military casualties and 30,000 dead civilians. Norwegian chief of defence Eirik Kristoffersen gave the figures in an interview with TV2, without specifying how the numbers were calculated. The figures cannot be independently verified.",

                    "bodyText": "China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship just days before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. In brief televised remarks, Wang said China and Russia were ready to deepen their strategic cooperation. Putin said that “Russian-Chinese relations were proceeding as planned” and talked of reaching “new milestones” in areas such as bilateral trade. Putin said the two countries had “ongoing cooperation” in international affairs and expressed Russia’s gratitude to China. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months, although an exact date has not been announced. Joe Biden has been meeting the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Speaking ahead of talks Biden said it was “absolutely clear” that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato”. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit was an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was ”looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. A group of 10 EU member states has called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. EU countries on Wednesday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the UN’s behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the UN nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, reported that two people were injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said a shopping mall has been struck by Ukrainian fire in the Russian town of Shebekino, severely injuring one person. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. The International Federation of Journalists said on Wednesday it had suspended the membership of Russia’s main journalism trade union after it established branches in occupied regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. Vincent Van Quickenborne, the Belgian justice and North Sea minister, said in a statement headlined “Russian spy ship off our coast in November”. It comes after the Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia had been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. Speaking before a crowd of thousands in the gardens of Warsaw’s Royal Castle on Tuesday, Joe Biden hailed the resilience of Ukraine’s people and the benevolence of Poland and other western allies in helping fend off the Russian invasion. The US president said the attack on Ukraine would never be a victory for Russia, and said new sanctions against Russia will be announced this week. India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. The foreign ministers of the G7 on Tuesday said their countries would continue to impose economic costs on Russia and urged the broader international community to reject what they described as Moscow’s “brutal expansionism”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, gave a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament on Tuesday, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin also announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it could have deployed. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he regretted Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty and urged Moscow to reconsider. Spain plans to send six 2A4 Leopard tanks to Ukraine, defence minister Margarita Robles told lawmakers. “We are repairing right now six Leopard 2A4 vehicles … with the possibility – if needed and if our allies request it – of increasing that number,” Robles said. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks in the home and communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Vladimir Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war.",

                    "bodyText": "The operator of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has been prevented from restarting its only operable atomic facility after a series of safety breaches, dealing a significant blow to Japanese attempts to resume nuclear power generation. Japan’s nuclear regulator is to issue a “corrective action order” on Wednesday that would ban Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) from transporting new uranium fuel to its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata prefecture or loading fuel rods into its reactors. The move in effect prevents Tepco from restarting the facility’s seven reactors, which it hopes would turn around its finances a decade after one of its two plants in Fukushima suffered a triple meltdown. Tepco had hoped to bring two of seven reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant with a capacity of 8,212 megawatts – back online to cut its operating costs by more than $800m (£580m) a year. In March, however, it was heavily criticised after a series of safety and security breaches came to light, including an unauthorised employee accessing sensitive areas of the facility and a failure to protect nuclear materials. Media reports said Wednesday’s decision was the first time the nuclear regulation authority – which was formed after the March 2011 disaster – had in effect banned a utility from operating a nuclear power plant. Tepco has not commented on the move, but its shares fell by almost 4% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. The company has until late September to submit a report to regulators outlining improvements in the way it handles nuclear materials. The agency will assess the changes before possibly removing the corrective order, a process that could take at least a year. Tepco has said it can save $827m in fuel costs annually by restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s No 6 and 7 reactors, which have been offline since at least 2012. When all seven of its reactors are in operation, the plant can generate enough power for 16m households. Tepco faces an enormous bill for decommissioning costs and compensation claims by residents living near the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant. The regulator’s decision came a day after the government announced that Tepco would release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water from Fukushima Daiichi into the Pacific Ocean, prompting an angry response from local fishers and neighbouring countries. On Wednesday, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, instructed his country’s officials to look into ways to refer Japan’s move to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, including filing for an injunction.

Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe’s LNG since February 2020.</p> <p>But Russia doesn’t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Qatar and Australia. Qatar is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/qatar-in-talks-to-supply-gas-to-europe-if-russia-cuts-supplies\">willing to increase LNG exports to Europe</a> and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals.</p> <p>On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147bn cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely.</p> <p>But Wood Mackenzie’s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take “at least a decade” in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe’s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals.</p> <p>Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive.</p> <p>Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/gas-prices-near-record-highs-berlin-rejects-pipeline-russia-germany-ukraine-nord-stream-2\">sky-high prices</a> would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies.</p> <p>“It’s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,” he said.</p> <h2><strong>Alternative pipelines</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80658317b3e7782120f06561a3bfc28bb74a8f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80658317b3e7782120f06561a3bfc28bb74a8f1/0_54_5481_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gas pipes at Groningen in the Netherlands, where production is being wound down after nearby earthquakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gas pipes at Groningen in the Netherlands, where production is being wound down after nearby earthquakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain and Norway’s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited.</p> <p>Marzec-Manser said Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there’s “not much more they can do”. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase.</p> <p>The Netherland’s’ vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13bn cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/gas-field-earthquakes-put-netherlands-biggest-firms-on-extraction-notice\">found to be causing earthquakes</a>.

While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes.</p> <p>France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/germany-agrees-to-end-reliance-on-coal-stations-by-2038\">said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants</a>.

                    "bodyText": "As Boris Johnson told parliament that Europe must wean itself off Russian gas – to loosen Vladimir Putin’s “grip on western politics” – the Nikolay Zubov tanker was making its way back from British waters to the port of Sabetta, in northern Siberia. The 300m-long vessel had recently dropped off a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Isle of Grain terminal, in the Thames Estuary, operated by the National Grid. Steaming north under a Cypriot “flag of convenience”, it charted a course for Russia’s Arctic coast, near the vast $27bn (£20bn) Yamal gas facility, personally inaugurated by Putin in 2017. Britain gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, either flowing through subsea interconnector pipelines or arriving by boat at the Isle of Grain and two further LNG facilities at Milford Haven, South Wales. In the EU, whose gas market is so intermeshed with Britain’s that it effectively determines the prices paid by UK end users, the picture is very different. Russia exports between 150bn and 190bn cubic metres of gas to Europe each year, typically fulfilling 30-40% of demand across the continent. It accounts for 65% of imports into Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany and 100% for countries such as Latvia and Czech Republic. The obstacles to replacing Russian supplies are logistical, financial and political. So, if Europe – and by extension the UK – want to reduce their reliance on Putin’s pumps, what are the options and how feasible are they, particularly in the short term? Liquefied natural gas LNG is super-chilled gas, condensed into liquid form and transported by ship and “regasified” at specialist terminals. Ports including Milford Haven and Grain – Europe’s biggest LNG terminal – take regular shipments. In 2020, Russian LNG accounted for 3% of total UK gas supply and, so far at least, there is no sign of shipments being affected by sanctions. European ports including Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also welcomed Siberian visitors of late. Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe’s LNG since February 2020. But Russia doesn’t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Qatar and Australia. Qatar is reportedly willing to increase LNG exports to Europe and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals. On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147bn cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely. But Wood Mackenzie’s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take “at least a decade” in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe’s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals. Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive. Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with sky-high prices would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies. “It’s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,” he said. Alternative pipelines Britain and Norway’s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited. Marzec-Manser said Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there’s “not much more they can do”. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase. The Netherland’s’ vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13bn cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was found to be causing earthquakes. Reversing that decision looks politically unpalatable. Nuclear power or coal Nuclear power reduces reliance on gas for electricity and the UK generates up to 20% of its power that way. While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes. France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants. Those decisions have left it more dependent than most major economies on Russian gas. In practice, Germany is unlikely to change its mind on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Given the climate crisis, few European countries are minded to turn back to coal. Fracking The UK government ordered a moratorium on all new fracking wells in 2019 but the gas price crisis has brought advocates out of the woodwork. They include Lord Frost – who presided over the UK’s Brexit negotiations – and Viscount Ridley, who chaired Northern Rock when it collapsed. The idea is that the UK could mimic the shale gas revolution that has transformed the US into a net energy exporter. Experts say otherwise – that fracking the way out of the Ukraine crisis doesn’t make geological, logistical, economic or political sense. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, points out that the UK’s reserves are harder to tap geologically than those in the US. Unlike the US, potential sites are surrounded by densely populated areas that are governed by strict planning laws and populated by people who don’t actually support fracking, making it politically impossible. Concerns about water and noise pollution persist and even if those were overcome, fracking would have vanishingly little impact on European wholesale prices, while also taking years to develop. “By the time we did it, we probably wouldn’t need the gas,” said Bradshaw. Renewables and home insulation Ultimately, renewable energy and decreased demand, by improving home energy efficiency through better insulation, offers the most obvious long-term solution. However, this depends on major investment and improvement in technologies such as battery storage, which makes up for the intermittency in supply from technologies such as wind power. Marzec-Manser said that the Ukraine crisis might well motivate Europe to go hell for leather for a renewable future but that it is already moving faster than any other part of the world. “It’s like trying to move into sixth gear when your car only has five gears,” he said.",

                    "bodyText": "South Korea’s military has apologised after a missile it launched during a drill on Tuesday malfunctioned and crashed to the ground, causing alarm among nearby residents who thought they were under attack from North Korea, which had test launched a missile earlier in the day. The live-fire drill, involving South Korea and the US, was supposed to be a show of strength by the allies, hours after the North sent an intermediate-range missile over northern Japan. Instead, it ended in embarrassment when a short-range Hyumoo-2 ballistic missile crashed to the ground inside an air force base near the South Korean coastal city of Gangneung. Although the missile did not explode, the noise and subsequent fire caused some Gangneung residents to believe the North had launched an attack, according to media reports. There were no reports of injuries. The South Korean military acknowledged the accident hours after internet users posted videos showing an orange ball of flames emerging from an area they described as near a Gangneung air force base. The military said it was investigating what had caused the “abnormal flight” of the South Korean missile – a key part of its preemptive and retaliatory strike strategies against the North. The accident occurred as the South Korean and US militaries fired a volley of missiles into the East Sea – also known as the Sea of Japan – in response to North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years. The nuclear-armed state launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile that flew for a record distance of 4,600km (2,850 miles) at n altitude of 1,000km, in its most provocative weapons demonstration in years. That range puts the US Pacific territory of Guam, homes to American military bases, within striking distance. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean about 3,200km east of Japan. Japan’s government issued an alert urging residents to take cover as the missile passed high over the northernmost main island of Hokkaido and Aomori prefecture. The US and South Korean militaries fired two ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles into the water “to precisely strike a virtual target,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The drills “showed the ability and readiness to neutralise the origin of the provocation while maintaining a constant monitoring posture,” it said in a statement. On Tuesday, South Korean and US fighter jets had carried out a bombing drill at a target in the Yellow Sea. The drills aim to “make sure that we have the military capabilities at the ready to respond to provocations by the North if it comes to that,” US national security council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. “It shouldn’t come to that. We have made it clear to (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un we’re willing to sit down with no preconditions. We want to see the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” he said. “He hasn’t shown an inclination to move in that direction – and quite frankly he’s moving in the opposite direction by continuing to conduct these missile tests, which are violations of Security Council resolutions.” Pyongyang’s latest launch is part of a record year of sanctions-busting weapons tests by the isolated regime, which recently revised its laws to declare itself an “irreversible” nuclear power. US president Joe Biden and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea’s latest launch “in the strongest terms”. South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol called the launch a “provocation”, and vowed a “stern response”. The Tuesday test was Pyongyang’s fifth missile launch in 10 days. North Korea does not routinely comment on its weapons tests in state media. South Korean and US officials have been warning for months that Kim is preparing to conduct another nuclear test, saying last week that this could happen soon after Pyongyang’s key ally China holds a Communist party congress from 16 October. US vice-president Kamala Harris visited Seoul last week and toured the heavily fortified demilitarised zone that divides the Korean peninsula, on a trip to underscore her country’s commitment to South Korea’s defence. About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to help protect it from the North.",

Our project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/disinfo-black-ops\">Disinfo black ops</a>,&nbsp;is exposing how&nbsp;false&nbsp;information is deliberately spread by powerful states and private operatives who sell their&nbsp;covert&nbsp;services to political campaigns, companies and wealthy individuals.&nbsp;It also reveals how inconvenient truths can be erased from the internet by those who are rich enough to pay.<b>&nbsp;</b>The investigation is part of Story killers, a collaboration led&nbsp;by Forbidden Stories, a French nonprofit&nbsp;whose mission is to pursue the work of assassinated, threatened or jailed reporters.</p>\n    <p>The eight-month investigation was inspired by the work of Gauri Lankesh, a 55-year-old journalist who was shot dead outside her Bengaluru home in 2017. Hours before she was murdered, Lankesh had been putting the finishing touches on an article called In the Age of False News, which examined how so-called lie factories online were spreading disinformation in India. In the final line of the article, which was published after her death, Lankesh wrote: “I want to salute all those who expose fake news. I wish there were more of them.”</p>\n    <p>The Story killers consortium includes more than 100 journalists from 30 media outlets including Haaretz, Le Monde, Radio France, Der Spiegel, Paper Trail Media, Die Zeit, TheMarker and the OCCRP. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/disinfo-black-ops\">Read more about this project.</a></p>\n    <p>Investigative journalism like this is vital for our democracy.

Canaelan is, in fact, a non-human bot linked to a vast army of fake social media profiles controlled by a software designed to spread “propaganda”. Advanced Impact Media Solutions, or Aims, which controls more than 30,000 fake social media profiles, can be used to spread disinformation at scale and at speed. It is sold by “Team Jorge”, a unit of disinformation operatives based in Israel. Tal Hanan, who runs the covert group using the pseudonym “Jorge”, told undercover reporters that they sold access to their software to unnamed intelligence agencies, political parties and corporate clients. One appears to have been sold to a client who wanted to discredit the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a statutory watchdog. On 18 October 2020, the ICO ruled that the government should reveal which companies were awarded multimillion-pound contracts to supply PPE after being entered into a “VIP” lane for politically connected companies. “This is politically motivated, it’s clear!” Canaelan lamented on Twitter two days later. That comment was part of a chorus of disapproval generated by the bots, who seemed aghast. “Information Commissioner tries everything to destroy the government,” one said, while another described the ruling as a “desperate act”. All of the “replies” under that and other tweets were united in their outrage at the ICO, which they described as “a waste of time” and “lame”. As the replies continued, they became more trenchant, making wild and false accusations against the ICO about bribes, corruption and links to the far right. Others just seemed nonplussed by the ICO’s insistence on transparency over the government’s pandemic procurement. “This is so typical from the UK …” one bot opined, “focusing on the wrong things.” It is not known who commissioned Team Jorge to unleash the bots on the ICO, or why. Hanan did not respond to detailed requests for comment but said: “To be clear, I deny any wrongdoing.” The ICO campaign appears to have been relatively short-lived compared with others around the world that reporters have been able to link to Team Jorge’s Aims software, which is much more than a bot-controlling programme. Each avatar, according to a demonstration Hanan gave the undercover reporters, is given a multifaceted digital backstory. Aims enables the creation of accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Telegram, Gmail, Instagram and YouTube. Some even have Amazon accounts with credit cards, bitcoin wallets and Airbnb accounts. Hanan told the undercover reporters his avatars mimicked human behaviour and their posts were powered by artificial intelligence. Using the Aims-linked avatars revealed by Team Jorge in presentations and videos, reporters at the Guardian, Le Monde and Der Spiegel were able to identify a much wider network of 2,000 Aims-linked bots on Facebook and Twitter. We then traced their activity across the internet, identifying their involvement in what appeared to be mostly commercial disputes in about 20 countries including the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Panama, Senegal, Mexico, Morocco, India, the United Arab Emirates, Zimbabwe, Belarus and Ecuador. The analysis revealed a vast array of bot activity, with Aims’ fake social media profiles getting involved in a dispute in California over nuclear power; a #MeToo controversy in Canada; a campaign in France involving a Qatari UN official; and an election in Senegal. One of the Aims-backed campaigns targeted a Monaco-based superyacht company, accusing it of having direct links to several Russian oligarchs who were subject to sanctions. We also identified real-world events that appeared to have been staged to provide ammunition that could be leveraged in social media campaigns.

However, what seems clear is that the avatars peddling propaganda are doing so with the help of stolen photographs of real people. The photo of a beaming man on Canaelan’s Twitter bio, the Guardian has established, was taken from the real Twitter page of Tom Van Rooijen, 25, a freelance Dutch journalist living in the Netherlands. Informed about the identity theft by the Guardian, Van Rooijen said he felt “quite uncomfortable” seeing his face beside a tweet expressing views he disagreed with. “I give a lot of workshops to school classes about news, media, journalism and fake news.

On 9 August, nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\" title=\"\">destroyed at the Saky airbase</a> on the peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Then, on Tuesday, blasts were reported at an ammunition site and airfield. Russia <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62560041\" title=\"\">blamed “sabotage”</a>. On Thursday night, there were reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/fires-and-explosions-reported-at-military-targets-in-russia-and-crimea\" title=\"\">more explosions</a> at the major Belbek airbase, as well as a blaze at a munitions depot inside Russia.</p> <p>All these are a much-needed fillip for Ukrainian morale. A senior presidential adviser has said that there is “strategic deadlock”. Though the picture in the country’s south is muddled, Russian forces appear largely stalled. But Ukraine is massively outgunned and Russia continues to gain ground in the east, albeit slowly and with serious losses, by pounding away with heavy artillery and no regard for the cost to Ukrainian civilians or its own forces.</p> <p>Events in Crimea are a long way from turning the tide. Officials in Ukraine say that they hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy\" title=\"\">hitting deep into occupied territory </a>will cut supply routes and erode Russian capabilities.

                    "bodyText": "A spate of explosions in Crimea has bolstered the mood in Ukraine. While Kyiv has been coy in discussing the incidents publicly, dropping heavy hints but not explicitly taking credit, unnamed officials have been busy briefing reporters. On 9 August, nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been destroyed at the Saky airbase on the peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Then, on Tuesday, blasts were reported at an ammunition site and airfield. Russia blamed “sabotage”. On Thursday night, there were reports of more explosions at the major Belbek airbase, as well as a blaze at a munitions depot inside Russia. All these are a much-needed fillip for Ukrainian morale. A senior presidential adviser has said that there is “strategic deadlock”. Though the picture in the country’s south is muddled, Russian forces appear largely stalled. But Ukraine is massively outgunned and Russia continues to gain ground in the east, albeit slowly and with serious losses, by pounding away with heavy artillery and no regard for the cost to Ukrainian civilians or its own forces. Events in Crimea are a long way from turning the tide. Officials in Ukraine say that they hope hitting deep into occupied territory will cut supply routes and erode Russian capabilities. The defence minister has said that it will ultimately launch a full-scale counter-offensive, when it has the weapons and ammunition that it needs from its partners. In other words, its more nimble approach is a matter of necessity as well as ability. Additionally, wars are only partially fought on the battlefield. Kyiv also needs to kindle renewed purpose at home and maintain national unity as the relief and pride at holding off the initial Russian onslaught inevitably fades, and grinding economic, social and psychological pressures take their toll. It needs to rattle the confidence of Moscow – which this week replaced the commander of its Black Sea fleet – and lower the morale of Russian forces. Russia felt safe in Crimea, with its tourists sunning themselves on the beaches. Now they have been filmed fleeing the sands, with plumes of black smoke visible in the distance. Finally, Kyiv needs a sense of fresh momentum to maintain support elsewhere. The story of a plucky, courageous underdog staving off a vicious invasion was enough to create a wave of public and political support across Europe this spring.

Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said, “it’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war.” “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link. It comes as talks between the G7 and other pro-Ukraine allies to set a cap on the price of Russian oil reportedly hit a set-back, after a meeting between EU officials ended without agreement. The price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil will form part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow by limiting its revenues from oil exports. EU diplomats were reportedly unable to reach an agreement on what price the cap should be set at. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s Energy Ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15.

Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the security council that Moscow was carrying out “strikes against infrastructure in response to the unbridled flow of weapons to Ukraine and the reckless appeals of Kyiv to defeat Russia”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest series of Russian strikes were a response to a decision by the European parliament to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” over its nine-month invasion of Ukraine, and its call for the 27-nation EU to follow. “Being unable to win in a fair fight with the Ukrainian army, Russia wages a cowardly war of terror against civilians,” Kuleba said, urging Kyiv’s western backers to supply more air defence systems. Wednesday’s decision by European legislators to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” is a symbolic political step with no legal consequences. Kyiv has for months called on the international community to declare Russia a “terrorist state,” and the EU parliament’s decision will probably anger Moscow. The resolution approved by EU lawmakers said the “deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine … and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror.” Ukraine praised the decision, with Zelenskiy calling for Russia to be “held accountable in order to end its longstanding policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

None of the claims could be independently verified.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Asked about the proposed borders, the Kremlin spokesperson, <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong>, said: “In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia.”</p></li> \n   <li><p>The <strong>UK ministry of defence</strong> has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Putin said in televised comments that he had signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. </strong>The Russian president said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter </strong><strong>Putin’s ability to wage war on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</strong> The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/28/brussels-promises-to-cap-price-russia-oil-putin-escalation-european-commission-sanctions-urkraine-war\">a week after the measures were proposed</a>, a timescale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russia’s foreign ministry has said the <strong>Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong> (ZNPP) would operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. <strong>Rafael Grossi</strong>, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. <strong>Energoatom</strong>, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Oleksandr Starukh</strong>, Ukraine’s governor of <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong>, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy</strong> has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.”</p></li> \n   <li><p>The Russian TV journalist <strong>Marina Ovsyannikova</strong>, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Anatoly Antonov</strong>, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainians-break-through-russian-defences-in-south-advance-rapidly-in-east?page=with:block-633c66358f08e5a4d3899a85#block-633c66358f08e5a4d3899a85\">Washington’s decision to send more military aid</a> to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia</strong>’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a <strong>Lithuanian</strong> diplomat.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The British prime minister, <strong>Liz Truss,</strong> has said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said: “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace.

Either you’re on one side of the front or the other. Every Russian citizen, including me, carries collective responsibility for this war, even if not a personal responsibility. Today Russia is a fascistic dictatorship, which, while we’re speaking here, is carrying out crimes against humanity.

                    "bodyText": "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns had been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia, has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. None of the claims could be independently verified. Asked about the proposed borders, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia.” The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Putin said in televised comments that he had signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian president said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week after the measures were proposed, a timescale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) would operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” The Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British prime minister, Liz Truss, has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said: “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win.” The latest report from Guardian correspondents in Kyiv and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. Read in full here: Ukrainian staff running the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) are preparing to restart one of the plant’s six reactors, all of which are currently shut down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “Senior Ukrainian operating staff informed IAEA experts present at the ZNPP that preparations are under way to start unit 5 at reduced power to produce steam and heat for the needs of the plant,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that preparations would take “some time”. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday ordering the Russian government to take control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and make it “federal property”, Reuters reported. The plant, the biggest in Europe, is controlled by Russian troops but has been operated until now by Ukrainian staff. Its proximity to the frontline of fighting has raised international fears of a nuclear disaster. The electricity supply to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine is fragile, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said. “The situation with regards to external power continues to be extremely precarious. We do have at the moment external power, but it is, I would say, fragile. There is one line feeding the plant,” said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, via telephone link from Ukraine. Addressing the Energy Intelligence Forum in London on Wednesday, he added that his itinerary would also take him to Russia for talks. Russia’s foreign ministry said today that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat in a retaliatory move. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on its website, the ministry said that it “reserves the right to take additional measures” in response to what it called Lithuania’s “unfriendly steps”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in televised comments that he signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. Reuters reports that speaking at a meeting with teachers, which was broadcast on state television to mark World Teachers’ Day, Putin said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. Reuters has a quick snap that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said at a televised meeting with teachers today that Russia had “great respect” for the Ukrainian people, despite what he called “the current situation”. Referring to the four partly Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian territory on Friday, Putin said he expected the situation there to “stabilise”. The former spokesperson to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and one of his erstwhile closest confidantes who was present during his only encounter with Vladimir Putin in 2019, has published a book in which she recalls her time working at Zelenskiy’s side, and does not shy away from criticising him. In The Fight of Our Lives: My Time With Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s Battle for Democracy and What It Means for the World, due for print publication in the UK on 27 October, Iuliia Mendel details her former boss’s improbable rise from comedian to president, focusing on the two years she worked with him until the summer 2021. In an interview with the newspaper Bild, to coincide with the German publication of her book, Mendel said that no one in Ukraine had been prepared for war, not even Zelenskiy. But she says she believes Zelenskiy should have acted sooner on intelligence information that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. “There is of course criticism in Ukraine. People say: ‘If he knew, he should have told people so that they could have been brought to safety.’ I would say it was very unfair not to tell people anything. There is a lot of injustice contained in this behaviour. But if you ask me what I would have done as a leader, then I really don’t know.” Mendel said that much of what Zelenskiy has done since the invasion has been “very natural and intuitive. Very logical and correct.” “I have often been asked about the transition of his image, from the suit to the T-shirt, and whether there were stylists behind the scenes,” she said. But Zelenskiy she insists “made all the decisions himself” and there was “no place for stylists” in the air-raid bunker in which he lived with his core team for weeks on end. Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders in the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson, has suggested on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have been suffering casualties during their attempt to push down into Kherson. He posted: The big game in the Kherson region continues. For many Ukronazis, this game has already ended on the outskirts. All who come with weapons to the territory of the Kherson region of the Russian Federation will be destroyed. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. EU diplomats confirmed that the bloc had agreed to cap the price of Russian oil, after providing “assurances” to Greece, Cyprus and Malta, countries with large shipping industries. Prior to the agreement, these countries argued the oil price cap should not be imposed by the EU without guarantees that other non-EU countries, such as India, would also sign up to a price cap. The EU oil price cap follows a pledge by the G7 earlier this month. Under plans agreed by the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and Italy, firms shipping and insuring Russian oil will only be able to operate if they adhere to a price below a yet-to-be-determined level. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the agreement, saying the EU had moved quickly and decisively. EU officials will be relieved to have secured agreement before two days of summitry in Prague, partly intended as a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Leaders from 44 countries across Europe will meet on Thursday in the Czech capital to discuss security on the continent, followed by an EU summit on Friday where the bloc’s leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Garry Kasparov, the former chess world champion and anti-Putin regime campaigner, has given an interview to the German news magazine Spiegel in which he says that “every Russian who is living in Russia now is part of the war machine” and demands that those who want to stand on the right side of history should leave. Kasparov tells the magazine that he has spent 20 years fighting against Vladimir Putin. “I always said that his regime would unavoidably become a fascist threat – not only for Russia, not only for its neighbours, but for the entire world. It would have been nice if a few more people would have taken this warning to heart.” Asked by Spiegel if being abroad – he has lived in political exile since 2013 – he wasn’t in too comfortable a position to be making such demands of those who have yet to leave Russia, he said: “This is war. Either you’re on one side of the front or the other. Every Russian citizen, including me, carries collective responsibility for this war, even if not a personal responsibility. Today Russia is a fascistic dictatorship, which, while we’re speaking here, is carrying out crimes against humanity. And everyone who is still living in Russia now, is a part of this war machinery, whether he wants to be or not.” Kasparov said Russians who want to be given asylum elsewhere should first have to sign a three-point declaration in which they would “declare the war to be criminal, the Putin regime illegitimate and Ukraine indivisible”, Kasparov said. By signing it, the individual would be liable for prosecution in Russia on three counts according to laws Putin has put in place, he added. The 59-year old chess grandmaster makes the interesting claim that Putin “never played chess, but poker, and he was good at geopolitical poker. He often played with bad cards and won, because his opponents fell for his bluff.” The Financial Times is quoting Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff, on how vital it is that Ukrainian forces are able to make swift progress during this phase of their counter-offensive. The newspaper reports he said: Certainly it is crucial to advance swiftly in liberating occupied territory because there is a sense that changes in the weather will limit further active military actions in this region. If our allies were to help us by providing more of the modern weaponry we are asking for, then the situation would be much swifter and we would not be talking about the factor of weather. Russian news agency RIA is carrying quotes from the deputy foreign minister of Russia Sergei Vershinin confirming that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi will be visiting Moscow. It quotes Vershinin saying: I confirm reports that Grossi is going to come to Kyiv, and then to Moscow. In terms of time, these will be the next few days. Vershinin went on to say: Grossi put forward a number of ideas that are now being discussed with experts. The task is nuclear safety and the exclusion of shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is carried out by the Ukrainian side, and the normal functioning of the nuclear power plant. The IAEA has previously called for a nuclear safety exclusion zone around the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Until now it has continued to be operated by staff employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-enterprise which manages the plant. However, the plant sits on land that has now been claimed to be annexed by Russia, and Vershinin said: “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is now on the territory of the Russian Federation and, accordingly, should be operated under the supervision of our relevant agencies.” Both Russian and Ukraine have accused the other side of shelling the plant and risking a nuclear accident. Reuters is reporting some diplomatic tension between Russia and Kazakhstan over the Ukraine war with Kazakh authorities rejecting a demand from Russia that they expel Ukraine’s ambassador over comments about killing Russians, chiding Moscow for what they called an inappropriate tone between “equal strategic partners”. Ukraine’s ambassador in Astana, Petro Vrublevskiy, said in August in an interview with a local blogger that “the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill”. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Tuesday said Moscow was “outraged” by the fact that Vrublevskiy was still in Astana and had summoned the Kazakh ambassador. Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov on Wednesday called Zakharova’s tone “discordant with the nature of the allied relations between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners”, adding that the Russian ambassador would in turn be summoned to the Kazakh ministry. The British Prime Minister Liz Truss has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory while addressing the annual conference of the UK’s ruling Conservative party in Birmingham. She said: The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. Putin’s illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory is just the latest act in his campaign to subvert democracy and violate international law. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win. She received one of the warmest rounds of applause of her speech for the section on Ukraine and went on to say that she was sure that Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people would appreciate “our solidarity with them at this very difficult time”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked in his regular briefing about the borders of Russia’s claimed annexation. He said: Read the order. There is a legal wording there. In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia. The state-owned Tass news agency reported earlier: New regions within Russia will retain the status of republics and regions and their former names. According to the documents, the boundaries of the regions will be determined by their borders, which “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. The territory of the DPR and LPR is defined by the 2014 borders established in their constitutions. Zaporizhzhia is part of the Russian Federation within its administrative boundaries, and Kherson region - with two districts of the Mykolaiv region, explained the head of the State Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov. The Kremlin said this morning that there was no contradiction between incorporating Ukrainian territories into the Russian Federation and military retreats, saying that Moscow would press ahead with its plans to annex four Ukrainian regions. “They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned,” Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media. President Vladimir Putin formalised the annexation of the four Ukrainian regions – around 18% of Ukraine’s territory – this morning despite a series of major battlefield reversals in recent days shrinking the amount of seized territory Moscow can say it actually controls. Russian forces lost a vast numbers of tanks during the first few months of the war, prompting questions over whether they were becoming obsolete. But the tank has previously appeared to have been consigned to the ash heap of history only to rise again to reaffirm its relevance. Josh Toussaint-Strauss examines for the Guardian Russia’s early deployment during the invasion and asks: if tanks aren’t the problem, why did they fail in Ukraine? Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message: “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. This is Martin Belam in London, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The BBC’s Orla Guerin earlier published some pictures from her recent visit to areas that have been liberated from Russian occupation, saying: “The Russians are gone but there is damage that can never be undone, and the dead cannot be restored to life.” There are another couple of quotes on Telegram from sources within the Russian-occupied Donetsk region from Denis Pushilin, who is Russia’s acting governor in the territory it has claimed to annex there. He has said that “the situation on the frontline in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, and that “we see that Ukrainian armed forces are now seriously supplemented by brigades that were trained in Nato countries, this must be taken into account”. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after Russia claimed to have formally annexed the wider Zaporizhzhia region, the RIA state-owned news agency reported. Reuters reports that another state-owned news agency, Tass, carried news that Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Tass is also reporting that Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-imposed acting “governor” of Zaporizhzhia said that yesterday “there were about 40 strikes on the outskirts and the city of Enerhodar”, which houses the nuclear power plant. “Yesterday was pretty hot for us,” he added. Sir Andrew Wood, former British ambassador to Yugoslavia and Russia, and an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, was interviewed in the UK on Sky News earlier about the situation in Ukraine. He said he believed Vladimir Putin had made a “fatal error” with the partial mobilisation, which had bought the war closer to home, and was “chaotically ill-done”. He said he expected fighting to continue well into next year but raised doubts about whether Russia would escalate the conflict to a nuclear level. He said: Nobody in the west wants to get involved in a nuclear exchange. I don’t think anybody in the Russian Federation would want to be involved in a nuclear exchange, except possibly President Putin. The whole trouble with Russia is everything is being decided by one man who hides from discussion, who hides from other possible views, that interferes in military undertakings by issuing direct orders to the commanders on the field and has thoroughly muddled up the whole situation. Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over charges of spreading fake news again, saying she had no case to answer. “I consider myself completely innocent, and since our state refuses to comply with its own laws, I refuse to comply with the measure of restraint imposed on me as of 30 September 2022 and release myself from it,” Reuters reports she said on Telegram. Ovsyannikova, 44, was given two months’ house arrest in August over a protest in July when she stood on a river embankment opposite the Kremlin and held up a poster calling President Vladimir Putin a murderer and his soldiers fascists. She faced a sentence of up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the charge of spreading fake news about Russia’s armed forces. If you missed it overnight, my colleague Peter Beaumont has been in the recently liberated city of Lyman, and sent this dispatch: Occupied until last week by soldiers of the Russian 20th Combined Arms army and Bars-13 troops from the Russian Guard – some of whom had earlier retreated from Kharkiv province – when the attack came they were quickly trapped in a rapidly closing encirclement as the villages outside the city, set among rolling hills, were rapidly rolled up. What is clear is that Ukraine’s military has found a way of fighting that is far more deft and flexible than the Russians – who are heavily reliant on their creaking supply lines – deploying quickly to cut off, encircle and destroy units piece by piece. And those Russians who stayed to fight were obliterated by shells and missile fire. Or shot in the forests. At a junction of a level crossing and a road, the trees around a Russian trench have been swept down as if by a giant hand, the road littered with artillery casings, bits of uniform and human remains. Surveying the scene, “Flagman”, a Ukrainian officer who has fought in this sector since Russia launched its invasion in February, said that while the Russians relied on the roads, the Ukrainians ambushed them from these woods. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report from Lyman: ‘What was it all for?’: recaptured Lyman left shattered by Russian occupation Russia’s RIA Novosti has some further quotes from Vladimir Rogov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Zaporizhzhia. It quotes him saying: “The situation on the line of contact remains stably tense. The counter-battery fight continues.” Another of the Russian-imposed leaders in the regions the Russian Federation is claiming to annex in occupied Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov of Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region. Denis Pushilin, another Russian-imposed leader, has also been reported by RIA as saying that Ukrainian forces are in the retreat in Bakhmut, “without the ability to hold its previously occupied positions”. None of the claims have been independently verified. Roland Oliphant, who is a senior foreign correspondent at the Telegraph , has suggested that much of what happens next in the war depends on whether the current Russian retreat is being carried out in good order back to sound defensive lines, which he says is how it is being described by some Russian sources, or whether it is a rout, as described by some Ukrainian voices. He suggests: It seems to me an awful lot depends on this, because the former may mean a winter stalemate and Russia staying in the war for the time being. The latter – a third disaster in a month and a snowball to general defeat that may be impossible to stop. However, he also cautions that “you may as well read a horoscope” as try to predict the outcome, saying: “I would advise you not to trust anyone who claims to know either way this morning. Everyone, with the exception of Ukrainian and Russian commands, is reading tea-leaves through the news blackout and Telegram.” Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, a region which today Russia has claimed to annex under Russian law, has issued a status update on Telegram. He says: The enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed. Information about victims is being clarified. The anti-aircraft defence forces have worked. If you see unexploded munitions, don’t disturb it, do not come close, do not take pictures. Report the find to the rescuers. French junior minister for European affairs Laurence Boone has clarified the situation in which Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine can obtain visas to stay in France. Reuters quotes her telling Franceinfo radio: “We have limited conditions under which visas can be given. We will make sure dissident journalists, people who fight the regime, artists and students can still come here, and we will issue visas on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the security risks.” Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in Ukraine’s Kherson region, has told the Russian Tass news agency that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped”. The claim has not been independently verified, and the news agency has provided no further details. It won’t come as a huge surprise to learn that Denis Pushilin, who had been acting as the self-declared leader of the chiefly unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic, and who was in Moscow for Vladimir Putin’s annexation ceremony last week, has been immediately named as the Russian president’s choice to lead the Donetsk region as it is absorbed into the Russian Federation by Russian law. The Telegram channel of the Donetsk People’s Republic has published an image of the law. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas. Russian state media Tass is reporting that the documents have been published now that Putin has signed them. It says: The boundaries of the new subjects of the Federation, as follows from the treaties, will be determined by the boundaries that “existed on the day of their formation and acceptance into the Russian Federation”. Until the election of the heads of the new regions, in accordance with Russian law, they will be led by temporary acting officials appointed by Putin. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting the words of Vladimir Rogov, an official in the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia. He is claiming that Ukraine will stage a “provocation” at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station (DHP). It quotes him: Extremely unhealthy activity has been observed in relation to the DHP in the city of Zaporizhzhia, temporarily under the control of the Zelenskiy regime. The information we receive cannot but cause concern for the fate of our native land. The Kyiv authorities understand that Zaporizhzhia is both de facto and de jure already Russia, and the liberation of the rest of the Zaporizhzhia region is only a matter of time. So, while waiting for our offensive, according to their plan, the DHP can become the object of a provocation in order to blame Russia for everything. Rogov produced no evidence to back up his claims, but cited an exercise carried out in 2018 which simulated what would happen if the dam was breached, claiming that it would unleash “a 20-metre wave covering the coastal part of the city at a speed of over 60km per hour”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of images across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message: Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible. Vitaliy Kim, Ukraine’s governor of Mykolaiv, has posted his daily status update on Telegram, which lists Russian shelling across a number of settlements within his region. He says that nobody was injured overnight, but there was damage yesterday to infrastructure facilities in Voznesensk. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today – handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London who will take you through the latest for the next while. The UK ministry of defence has published its daily intelligence update on the war, reporting that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” The other developments included in the report were: Ukrainian formations have advanced up to 20km beyond the river into Russia’s defensive zone towards the supply node of the town of Svatove. It is highly likely that Ukraine can now strike the key Svatove-Kremina road with most of its artillery systems, further straining Russia’s ability to resupply its units in the east. Politically, Russian leaders will highly likely be concerned that leading Ukrainian units are now approaching the borders of Luhansk Oblast, which Russia claimed to have formally annexed last Friday. There are major questions over the prospects of the “European Political Community” summit being launched in Prague on Thursday, AFP reports. The one-day gathering , the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron, will bring together the 27 European Union leaders with those from the broader neighbourhood, including Britain, Turkey and Ukraine. Brussels has billed the initiative as an invaluable “platform for political coordination” among the disparate grouping of 44 nations invited. But there are deep disagreements, among some of those attending and scepticism that the one-day event will turn out to be much more than a glorified photo opportunity. Russia was not invited and Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv. His prime minister will stand in for him at the talks. “The ambition is to bring leaders together on an equal footing and to foster political dialogue and cooperation on issues of common interest so that, together, we work on strengthening the security, stability and prosperity of Europe as a whole,” EU chief Charles Michel said in his invitation letter. As speculation mounts ahead of Friday’s Nobel peace prize announcement, observers suggest the committee may sound the alarm over the war in Ukraine, AFP reports. Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), suggested the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, saying they deserved to win the prestigious honour together. “These are both champions of non-violent pro-democracy activities within their own countries,” he said. “And both Navalny and Tikhanovskaya have also been very strong opponents of the war in Ukraine”. Meanwhile, a price cap for Russian oil proposed as part of the European Union’s eighth round of sanctions against Russia will not apply to pipeline shipments, Hungary‘s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said in a statement late on Tuesday. Hungary, which has been the most vocal critic of sanctions against Russia in the EU, largely relies on Russian crude shipments and Russian gas, both imported via pipelines. Major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia are set to meet today, as reports say they are mulling an output cut of up to 2m barrels per day in a bid to prop up slumping prices. If implemented, it will be the first such major cut since a landmark curb on production at the start of the Covid pandemic. Energy prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, pushing inflation to decades-high levels that have put pressure on economies across the world. But they have fallen in recent months on concerns over dwindling demand and a slowdown in the global economy. The 13 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, and their 10 allies headed by Russia will hold their first in-person meeting since March 2020 at the group’s headquarters in Vienna. Here is the latest on nuclear concerns in the conflict: The United States has no indication that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, despite “nuclear sabre-rattling” by Putin, according to the White House press secretary. An unnamed Western diplomat told Reuters that NATO has not warned alliance members of any Russian nuclear threat. And the Kremlin said it did not want to take part in “nuclear rhetoric” spread by the West after a British media report that Russia was preparing to demonstrate its willingness to use nuclear weapons in its conflict with Ukraine. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the West. “We perceive this as an immediate threat to the strategic interests of our country,” Antonov said on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday. “The supply of military products by the US and its allies not only entails protracted bloodshed and new casualties, but also increases the danger of a direct military clash between Russia and Western countries.” In case you missed this earlier, Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press on Tuesday. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Energoatom, the Ukranian state nuclear company, shut down the plant’s six remaining reactors on 11 September amid fighting in the area. Russian military activity had cut off power supplies for safety systems, raising fears of a meltdown, the AP noted. But Energoatom president Petro Kotin told the AP today that the company may restart two of the reactors in the coming days to “protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop”. Kotin said: If you have low temperature, you will just freeze everything inside. The safety equipment will be damaged. So you need heating and the only heating is going to come from the working reactor.” Even with the reactors shut down, damage to the systems or failures due to cold weather could still lead to catastrophe, the company’s president said, adding, “You have residual heat and you should constantly provide the coolant for these fuel assemblies. If you stop cooling, then you will have meltdown. And that is how it works … We, at the moment, are evaluating all the risks. And this depends on the weather. And actually, we don’t have much time to do that.” Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with Zelensky saying in an address on Tuesday that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Here is a roundup of what has happened on the battlefield, via Reuters: Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. Russian military bloggers described a Ukrainian tank advance through dozens of kilometres of territory along the west bank of the Dnipro. Kyiv has maintained almost complete silence about the situation in Kherson. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. Russia has meanwhile sacked the commander of its Western military district, news outlet RBC reported. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest for the next few hours. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced on Tuesday that dozens of regions in Ukraine have been liberated from Russian occupation. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, according to the Russian-installed head of the administration of occupied areas in the province. In the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. The pro-Russian leader in Donetsk said forces were forming a new defensive line around the town of Kreminna. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press today. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility. Ukraine’s economy will shrink at a rate eight times that of Russia’s this year as a result of the war triggered by Moscow’s invasion in February, the World Bank has estimated. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnieper river “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The upper house of Russia’s parliament voted on Tuesday to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, after a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to have annexed, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. Zelenskiy has signed a decree declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” The Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) will restore its network to oppose the partial mobilisation aimed at bolstering Russia’s forces in Ukraine, close Navalny ally Ivan Zhdanov said in a video published on social media. Russian authorities have designated Alexei Navalny’s organisations “extremist” after months of increasing repression against his supporters, putting FBK employees, volunteers and sympathisers at risk of prosecution and imprisonment.",

                    "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak has said he would find up to £10bn to help people facing rising energy bills, as a minister backing his Conservative leadership rival indicated that direct support for the hard-pressed would be announced “in a considered way”. Acknowledging he would have to increase government borrowing to tackle the crisis, the former chancellor sketched out what he envisaged would be a support package for up to 16 million vulnerable people. “People need reassurance now about what we will do and I make no apology for concentrating on what matters most,” Sunak wrote in the Times, which reported that he valued a cut to VAT on energy at £5bn. He was also said to have pledged to find the same amount again to go towards helping those most in need, as he said: “You can’t heat your home with hope.” It comes after Sunak claimed Liz Truss’s cost-of-living plans could put vulnerable people at risk of “real destitution”, with economic policy once again driving a wedge between the candidates. As Sunak and Truss took to the stage for the latest Tory party hustings in Cheltenham, Sunak refused to rule out “some limited and temporary one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter”. He also said that without further direct payments, pensioners and people on very low incomes could face serious hardship. However, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, who is supporting Truss, hit back on Friday morning, taking a veiled swipe at Sunak for not waiting for the energy regulator Ofgem to make a key announcement about the energy price cap before his latest intervention. Defending Truss, Coffey said: “She is absolutely an MP who knowns what it is like for struggling households and that is why, quite rightly in a considered way, once Ofgem comes up with their price cap … all of government … and it will be decision for the new prime minister to enact what changes could be made.” Referring to Sunak, she said: “I appreciate what he is saying that but Ofgem has not reported.

That was not given to me. That was blocked within government so if we are going to do things through the welfare system we would have to do brand new primary legislation,” she said. Sunak’s comments in Thursday’s hustings came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members that this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she said.",

                    "bodyText": "China is to be formally designated a “threat” to Britain in a hasty rewrite of Boris Johnson’s defence and foreign policy that is being brought forward to end confusion among ministers about how to deal with Beijing. Under Johnson, China had been categorised as a “systemic competitor” but the new prime minister, Liz Truss, wants to take a more hawkish stance quickly, as she seeks to shore up support for her faltering premiership on her backbenches. The redesignation will bring the UK’s official position towards China close to its stance on Russia, currently classed as “the most acute threat” facing the UK. But it is almost certain to provoke a hostile reaction from Beijing. It had been intended to complete the policy rewrite at the end of the year, but sources said a special China strategy review was now being brought forward after the Department for Education was forced into a climbdown by No 10 over the weekend after expressing support for China’s Confucius Institutes. One insider said the change could come “within days”. Influential Conservative backbenchers on Tuesday night welcomed the anticipated move. Iain Duncan Smith, who is campaigning to be chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said a hardening of the UK’s China policy was long overdue. “It is time we stopped messing around and recognised that China poses a threat to the way we live our lives, and it is time now to treat them in the same way we treat Russia,” the former party leader said. The DfE had issued a statement expressing support for China’s 30 Confucius Institutes, which promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture in the UK – only for Downing St to demand it made a firmer response. The revised statement said the “UK government is committed to doing more to adapt to China’s growing impact” and encouraged anybody with concerns about any of the Confucius Institute’s activities to report them. A report by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank had concluded most of the institutes were engaged in activities beyond their formal remit, including political lobbying and expanding China’s reach into advanced manufacturing. Truss has adopted a hawkish stance on China for some time – at one point leading opposition within the cabinet to TikTok moving its global headquarters to London – but her predecessor in Downing St was insistent on a more nuanced approach. In a private meeting Johnson once described himself as “fervently Sinophile”, a position out of kilter with many on the Conservative benches, who have been lobbying for a tougher approach for the fast few years. Britain’s stance towards China has swung dramatically in less than a decade, from the “golden era” proclaimed by David Cameron in 2015, the year in which its president, Xi Jinping, was granted a state visit to the UK. Beijing signalled it was keen to invest in strategic industries in Britain, such as nuclear power. But as Xi adopted a more authoritarian tone at home, concern among Conservatives grew, fuelled further by the desire of both the Trump and Biden administrations in the US to strike a more assertive approach in their dealings with Beijing. Pressure from the US and Conservative MPs had forced Johnson into a U-turn over Chinese telecoms equipment supplier Huawei in July 2020 over 5G. Huawei kit was banned from UK networks from 2027, although it was accompanied by a warning that this would delay 5G rollout by three years and cost an extra £7bn. The previous definition of China was contained in the Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, which sought to balance concerns about China’s authoritarian government with the need to collaborate on economic and climate issues. It was intended to set the tone for Britain’s global strategy for the next five years, but like many Johnson-era policies has been rapidly recast by Truss in her first weeks in government. Downing Street said the prime minister had commissioned an update to the Integrated Review partly in response to an increasingly aggressive China. “As she has said, Russia remains the biggest threat to the UK but China represents the most serious long-term threat to our values and way of life,” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Tuesday Jeremy Fleming, the head of spy agency GCHQ, said Beijing’s efforts to exploit control and surveillance capabilities in emerging technologies such as satellite location systems and digital currencies represents “a threat to us all”.",

                    "bodyText": "Liz Truss’s tax cut-based approach to the energy crisis risks putting millions of Britons in “real destitution”, Rishi Sunak has warned, as the Conservative leadership candidates again clashed bitterly over economic policy. The hustings event on Thursday in Cheltenham, a key Tory-held marginal seat, also saw the foreign secretary effectively rule out any increased windfall tax on energy firm profits, as she hit out at the “depressing” sight of fields used for solar power. Sunak’s vehement comments came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Also promising she would not call an election before 2024, Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she argued. Speaking after her, Sunak castigated Truss for what he said was a lack of action to help people who would not benefit from her planned reduction in national insurance contributions, including pensioners and those not in work. “We are going to, as a Conservative government, leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at the risk of real destitution,” the former chancellor said. “And I think that’s a real moral failure.” To do this would mean “the country will never, ever forgive us”, he added. Truss also said she would “absolutely” not support a wider windfall tax, saying: “I don’t think profit is a dirty word.” She added: “I think it’s a Labour idea. It’s all about bashing business, and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public.” Asked about an early election, she pledged: “I will not have an election before 2024. I think that’s a very important point, because we’ve got to deliver for people.” Quizzed about agricultural land, Truss hit out at its use for solar panels: “I think one of the most depressing sights when you’re driving through England is seeing fields that should be full of crops or livestock, full of solar panels.” She added: “I’m not against solar panels per se. There are plenty of commercial roofs in Britain where we could be putting solar panels. But where they shouldn’t be is on agricultural land that should be used for food production.” Sunak, widely seen as lagging well behind Truss among Tory members, pitched his appeal as a PM who could appeal to floating voters. Cheltenham is currently held by Tory MP Alex Chalk, who introduced Sunak, but with a majority of less than 1,000 over the Liberal Democrats. Asked how he could win over waverers, Sunak explicitly contrasted his style against that of Boris Johnson: “What they want is a government that works competently, seriously, with decency and integrity at the heart of everything it does. “That’s the kind of government I’m going to lead, and that’s how we’re going to win the election.”",

Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river. An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy, Spanish politicians, a Spanish airbase and a company that makes rocket launchers on Wednesday. Spanish police confirmed to the Reuters news agency that an envelope similar to the previous letter bombs had been intercepted at the embassy. A private energy company in Ukraine has said that 40% of the country’s power infrastructure is damaged, as Russian attacks continue to target the supply. Millions have been without or with intermittent power since October, as Russia has focused its attacks on Ukraine’s energy system. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was impossible to discuss nuclear arms control while the war in Ukraine continues, claiming the “western involvement” must not be ignored. Lavrov said that the US was trying to break up Russia, and that it was “naive” to think talks could take place while this happened. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that Europe should go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russia if Russian president Vladimir Putin will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according to a report in the Times of his comments at a security conference in Berlin. The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine. Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package. Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine.

                    "body": "<p>Shortly after 4am on 28 March 1979, a pressure valve failed to close in the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant on a strip of land in central Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River. The technical malfunction, compounded by human error – control room workers misread confusing signals and halted the emergency water cooling system – heated the nuclear core to dangerously high levels. The film The China Syndrome was still in theaters, starring Jane Fonda as a television reporter investigating cover-ups at a nuclear power plant whose meltdown could release radioactive material deep into the earth, “all the way to China”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/20/what-we-now-know-they-lied-how-big-oil-companies-betrayed-us-all\">‘What we now know … they lied’: how big oil companies betrayed us all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three Mile Island – still the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history – was no China Syndrome, but it got terrifyingly close to catastrophic, Chernobyl-level damage. As the Netflix docuseries Meltdown: Three Mile Island recounts, Unit 2 came less than half an hour from fully melting down – a disaster scenario that would have sickened hundreds of thousands in the surrounding area. Two days after the accident, an explosive bubble of hydrogen gas was found in the reactor. The plant’s operator, Metropolitan Edison, tried to downplay the risk of radioactive releases, but panic ensued; more than 100,000 people fled the surrounding area. Plant technicians were eventually able to slowly bleed the gas from the cooling reactor, avoiding a deadly explosion. Though workers inside the plant were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, it remains unknown how much contamination escaped the facility into the surrounding community.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAOIH8HRdDo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nAOIH8HRdDo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That is the story of Three Mile Island that most Americans will find in the history textbooks, if they have heard of the accident at all. The first two of Meltdown’s four 45-minute episodes focus on this chilling near-miss, as well as the obfuscation and confusion that greatly eroded public trust in nuclear power. But the story of Three Mile Island did not end with the five-day red-alert saga – not for the workers tasked with safely cleaning up the molten reactor, nor for the surrounding community, disillusioned and furious.</p> <p>In its second half, Meltdown, directed by Kief Davidson, homes in on the story of Rick Parks, a cleanup supervisor turned whistleblower on the Bechtel Corp, the company hired to conduct the billion-dollar cleanup by Metropolitan Edison and supervised by the government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). “While a lot of people know about the disaster, they don’t know about what happened in the cleanup phase and how close we were to another disaster,” Davidson told the Guardian. “We dodged a bullet a second time, and it was entirely due to the fact that Rick Parks and [fellow whistleblower] Larry King stood up.</p> <p>“We should know about these stories,” he added. “We should be able to look at the people who risk everything in order to save communities from a potential disaster.”</p> <p>Parks, a Missouri native and navy-trained nuclear operator who provides colorful, refreshingly straight-shooting narration throughout the series, moved to Middletown, Pennsylvania – the town directly adjacent to Three Mile Island – to work on cleanup three years after the accident. At the time, Bechtel was the largest private construction company in the world, with numerous Reagan administration officials on its board. The cleanup was risky, arduous and behind schedule. Bechtel received funds upon completion of individual tasks, incentivizing the company and its hirer, General Public Utilities (GPU), to cut corners and ignore NRC regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d46b14531a4c3d1f832e0cb0b4d65ed6913cfa1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d46b14531a4c3d1f832e0cb0b4d65ed6913cfa1f/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meltdown: Three Mile Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Parks was particularly alarmed by rushed, off-books repairs to a polar crane damaged by radioactivity. The crane was supposed to lift the head off the reactor to expose the core; according to Park and the series, if the faulty crane malfunctioned and dropped its load on to the core, the resulting damage could have caused a radioactive leak on par with the China Syndrome. When Parks and two other employees, King and Ed Gischel, took their concerns to higher-ups at GPU and the NRC, they were dismissed. Gischel was recommended for a psychological evaluation. Parks found marijuana placed in his car on the day of a random drug inspection; someone later broke into his apartment and searched his files. (The NRC’s on-site coordinator, Lake Bennett, participates in the series and claims to not remember meeting Parks. He later say whatever Parks told him did not merit concern – “I was satisfied that that crane was safe enough.”)</p> <p>Gravely concerned for the safety of family, Middletown and a potentially statewide disaster zone, Parks took his records to the Government Accountability Project, then went public days before a vote would certify the crane’s use. His disclosures and mounting public pressure caused the NRC to halt and then overhaul the cleanup process at Three Mile Island.</p> <p>Carla Shamberg, Meltdown’s executive producer, first heard of Parks through lawyers for the <a href=\"https://whistleblower.org/\">Government Accountability Project</a>, some of whom appear in the series, while executive-producing another project: the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts as a real-life whistleblower. It’s taken nearly 20 years since for some version of it to make it to air. Parks and other whistleblowers were “superheroes”, she told the Guardian. “They’re one of the last bastions of the truth.”</p> <p>“I think they should have capes,” she said. “They’re just amazing. They protect people they’ve never met and they protect thousands, if not millions, of people. It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen anybody do.”</p> <p>Parks’s story has a relatively happy ending – the series delves into the personal and emotional costs of his disclosures, but the damaged crane was not used. In 1983, the same year he came forward, Metropolitan Edison was indicted on criminal charges of falsifying safety reports before the accident; the company’s plea bargain included a $45,000 fine and $1m pledge to help emergency planning in the surrounding area. Still, in the four decades since, “it hasn’t gotten better for whistleblowers,” said Davidson. “To go public now is a lot different than it was even 10 years ago. It’s a lot harder now. Whistleblowers aren’t always rewarded for their actions.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a2035094d60e91085e5b88c13cd04366ccd1a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a2035094d60e91085e5b88c13cd04366ccd1a3/84_0_2510_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meltdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To this day, the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html\">official government record</a> is that radiation released at Three Mile Island never reached levels dangerous to humans; the official death toll is zero. But local residents turned activists, several of whom appear in the series, <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/the-three-mile-island-accident-and-the-enduring-questions-of-ties-to-cancer-deaths/\">say otherwise</a>. The film cites a 1997 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9074881/#:~:text=Results%20support%20the%20hypothesis%20that,between%20radiation%20and%20cancer%20incidence.\">study</a> by epidemiologist Steven Wing, which found cancer rates two to three times the average in areas downwind of the facility. In 2017, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine found that a certain type of thyroid cancer was common in people who had been near the plant after the accident. Several subjects in the series – including Parks and his ex-stepdaughter Nicole, who was six years old at the time of the disaster – have survived bouts of cancer or lost loved ones to it. No one can be sure it’s related to radiation – Parks, who had throat cancer, was also a smoker, “so there’s always that but, and that’s why the NRC gets away with everything,” he says. But the anecdotes point to more than a coincidence.</p> <p>Still, “the project isn’t about how is the cancer, who got cancer, how many people got it,” said Davidson. Instead, the series argues for “holding industry and large corporations accountable for their actions.</p> <p>“We’re not coming into this story from a pro-nuclear standpoint,” said Davidson. “There’s pros and cons and arguments to both sides, and a lot of the characters that we’ve interviewed for this, like Rick Parks, really believe that to solve our energy crisis nuclear has to be in the mix.</p> <p>“But there’s consequences that have to be looked at. And when things go wrong, it can go wrong in a pretty horrible way,” he added. Or, as Parks says in the final episode: “We’ll never have a viable nuclear industry in this country until we take the profit motive out of it.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 6 May 2022 to correct the spelling of Ed Gischel’s surname.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Shortly after 4am on 28 March 1979, a pressure valve failed to close in the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant on a strip of land in central Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River. The technical malfunction, compounded by human error – control room workers misread confusing signals and halted the emergency water cooling system – heated the nuclear core to dangerously high levels. The film The China Syndrome was still in theaters, starring Jane Fonda as a television reporter investigating cover-ups at a nuclear power plant whose meltdown could release radioactive material deep into the earth, “all the way to China”. Three Mile Island – still the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history – was no China Syndrome, but it got terrifyingly close to catastrophic, Chernobyl-level damage. As the Netflix docuseries Meltdown: Three Mile Island recounts, Unit 2 came less than half an hour from fully melting down – a disaster scenario that would have sickened hundreds of thousands in the surrounding area. Two days after the accident, an explosive bubble of hydrogen gas was found in the reactor. The plant’s operator, Metropolitan Edison, tried to downplay the risk of radioactive releases, but panic ensued; more than 100,000 people fled the surrounding area. Plant technicians were eventually able to slowly bleed the gas from the cooling reactor, avoiding a deadly explosion. Though workers inside the plant were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, it remains unknown how much contamination escaped the facility into the surrounding community. That is the story of Three Mile Island that most Americans will find in the history textbooks, if they have heard of the accident at all. The first two of Meltdown’s four 45-minute episodes focus on this chilling near-miss, as well as the obfuscation and confusion that greatly eroded public trust in nuclear power. But the story of Three Mile Island did not end with the five-day red-alert saga – not for the workers tasked with safely cleaning up the molten reactor, nor for the surrounding community, disillusioned and furious. In its second half, Meltdown, directed by Kief Davidson, homes in on the story of Rick Parks, a cleanup supervisor turned whistleblower on the Bechtel Corp, the company hired to conduct the billion-dollar cleanup by Metropolitan Edison and supervised by the government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). “While a lot of people know about the disaster, they don’t know about what happened in the cleanup phase and how close we were to another disaster,” Davidson told the Guardian. “We dodged a bullet a second time, and it was entirely due to the fact that Rick Parks and [fellow whistleblower] Larry King stood up. “We should know about these stories,” he added. “We should be able to look at the people who risk everything in order to save communities from a potential disaster.” Parks, a Missouri native and navy-trained nuclear operator who provides colorful, refreshingly straight-shooting narration throughout the series, moved to Middletown, Pennsylvania – the town directly adjacent to Three Mile Island – to work on cleanup three years after the accident. At the time, Bechtel was the largest private construction company in the world, with numerous Reagan administration officials on its board. The cleanup was risky, arduous and behind schedule. Bechtel received funds upon completion of individual tasks, incentivizing the company and its hirer, General Public Utilities (GPU), to cut corners and ignore NRC regulations. Parks was particularly alarmed by rushed, off-books repairs to a polar crane damaged by radioactivity. The crane was supposed to lift the head off the reactor to expose the core; according to Park and the series, if the faulty crane malfunctioned and dropped its load on to the core, the resulting damage could have caused a radioactive leak on par with the China Syndrome. When Parks and two other employees, King and Ed Gischel, took their concerns to higher-ups at GPU and the NRC, they were dismissed. Gischel was recommended for a psychological evaluation. Parks found marijuana placed in his car on the day of a random drug inspection; someone later broke into his apartment and searched his files. (The NRC’s on-site coordinator, Lake Bennett, participates in the series and claims to not remember meeting Parks. He later say whatever Parks told him did not merit concern – “I was satisfied that that crane was safe enough.”) Gravely concerned for the safety of family, Middletown and a potentially statewide disaster zone, Parks took his records to the Government Accountability Project, then went public days before a vote would certify the crane’s use. His disclosures and mounting public pressure caused the NRC to halt and then overhaul the cleanup process at Three Mile Island. Carla Shamberg, Meltdown’s executive producer, first heard of Parks through lawyers for the Government Accountability Project, some of whom appear in the series, while executive-producing another project: the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts as a real-life whistleblower. It’s taken nearly 20 years since for some version of it to make it to air. Parks and other whistleblowers were “superheroes”, she told the Guardian. “They’re one of the last bastions of the truth.” “I think they should have capes,” she said. “They’re just amazing. They protect people they’ve never met and they protect thousands, if not millions, of people. It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen anybody do.” Parks’s story has a relatively happy ending – the series delves into the personal and emotional costs of his disclosures, but the damaged crane was not used. In 1983, the same year he came forward, Metropolitan Edison was indicted on criminal charges of falsifying safety reports before the accident; the company’s plea bargain included a $45,000 fine and $1m pledge to help emergency planning in the surrounding area. Still, in the four decades since, “it hasn’t gotten better for whistleblowers,” said Davidson. “To go public now is a lot different than it was even 10 years ago. It’s a lot harder now. Whistleblowers aren’t always rewarded for their actions.” To this day, the official government record is that radiation released at Three Mile Island never reached levels dangerous to humans; the official death toll is zero. But local residents turned activists, several of whom appear in the series, say otherwise. The film cites a 1997 study by epidemiologist Steven Wing, which found cancer rates two to three times the average in areas downwind of the facility. In 2017, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine found that a certain type of thyroid cancer was common in people who had been near the plant after the accident. Several subjects in the series – including Parks and his ex-stepdaughter Nicole, who was six years old at the time of the disaster – have survived bouts of cancer or lost loved ones to it. No one can be sure it’s related to radiation – Parks, who had throat cancer, was also a smoker, “so there’s always that but, and that’s why the NRC gets away with everything,” he says. But the anecdotes point to more than a coincidence. Still, “the project isn’t about how is the cancer, who got cancer, how many people got it,” said Davidson. Instead, the series argues for “holding industry and large corporations accountable for their actions. “We’re not coming into this story from a pro-nuclear standpoint,” said Davidson. “There’s pros and cons and arguments to both sides, and a lot of the characters that we’ve interviewed for this, like Rick Parks, really believe that to solve our energy crisis nuclear has to be in the mix. “But there’s consequences that have to be looked at. And when things go wrong, it can go wrong in a pretty horrible way,” he added. Or, as Parks says in the final episode: “We’ll never have a viable nuclear industry in this country until we take the profit motive out of it.” • This article was amended on 6 May 2022 to correct the spelling of Ed Gischel’s surname.",

                    "bodyText": "California’s last nuclear plant was nearing the end of its life. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the aging facility known as Diablo Canyon began operating in 1985. It was designed for a different era, with analog knobs and systems that no longer comply with the state’s environmental standards. The plant has faced controversies over its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines – and its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But with just three years to go, the fate of Diablo Canyon now looks less assured. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. The plant still provides roughly 9% of the state’s energy – the largest single source of electricity and enough to supply more than 3 million residents. The state is still far from finding a reliable and climate-friendly replacement, and concerns are rising that it will fall back on fossil fuels to fill the gap. Now, decades-old discussions about whether the plant should continue to play a role in California’s renewable energy transition are being rehashed. A diverse league of advocates – including energy officials, scientists, California’s governor Gavin Newsom, and even the musician Grimes – are pushing for renewed life for Diablo Canyon. Critics, meanwhile, say keeping the plant open would only be a step backward. Diablo Canyon has come to signify broader questions about the state’s energy future, and whether it’s ready to leave nuclear power behind. It’s an issue also lingering in the thoughts of officials across the US. Half of the country’s clean energy comes from nuclear power plants – but in many areas, it is being phased out. “It’s a sort of a bellwether – a test – of the political future for nuclear power in California and in the shifting environmental coalitions,” said Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, an energy and environment thinktank that advocates in favor of nuclear energy. “I think the story of Diablo Canyon is more important than just another plant.” Protests and money problems The many plants that once dotted California have closed one by one, and a law passed in 1976 banned new construction of nuclear stations until waste could be permanently disposed of. That’s left Diablo Canyon as the sole provider of nuclear energy. Even before it began operating, Diablo Canyon was a source of scrutiny. For years it was the site of demonstrations as anti-nuclear sentiments grew in the wake of disasters like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and later on, Fukushima. There were concerns raised about environmental degradation and questions about storage of the nuclear waste produced by the facility. But it was not the protests that led to Diablo Canyon’s closure timeline. Instead, it was a matter of money. California regulators had cracked down on the system used at Diablo Canyon in 2010, a process known as “once-through cooling” for its impact on marine life. Roughly 2.5bn gallons of seawater slosh through the plant’s enormous intake tubes each day, cooling hot steam heated by nuclear reactors. The warmed water flushed back into the sea has had profound effects on ocean ecosystems and animals, including fish, sea lions, turtles, and other creatures are killed by the millions each year by the systems themselves, according to the California water board. Facing requirements for expensive upgrades and retrofits, estimated at roughly $4.5bn, and an increasingly competitive energy market centered around renewables, the plant’s owner and operator PG&amp;E agreed to a settlement in 2016 with environmental groups and labor organizations not to seek renewal on the licenses for its two reactors, which expire in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Endorsed by state regulators in 2018, the plan also gave California nearly a decade to ramp up the decarbonization of its grid and replace the lost energy with more affordable renewable sources. Unlike other plants that shut down abruptly due to mechanical errors or financing issues, the end of Diablo Canyon was heralded as an opportunity to phase out nuclear the right way. Energy challenges amid the climate crisis But in the years since, the energy landscape has shifted.

If decarbonization is not escalated quickly, California stands to emit an additional 15.5m metric tons of greenhouse gasses with the closure of Diablo Canyon, according to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists published last year.

Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home.</p> \n<p>The Kremlin seemed unaware of – or indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away.

It is situated inside the 30km exclusion zone, which covers 260,000 hectares of territory. The Russian infantry fighting vehicles arriving every few minutes threw up clouds of radioactive dust. Soldiers, meanwhile, worked and slept in Chernobyl’s prohibited deadly red zone, near the abandoned city of Pripyat.</p> \n<p>Historians may describe what happened around Chernobyl as a case of imperial hubris.

Next to a pockmarked bus stop was debris left behind by Vladimir Putin’s army: machine-gun bullets, cigarette packets and an empty tin of tuna. “It was a difficult time. People are worried the Russians might come back,” Davidenko said. He added: “I talked to the Russian soldiers as they drove past. They were young guys from Siberia. They asked me: ‘Batya [Dad], how are you living?’ I answered: ‘We are fine here, thanks very much.’” Russian forces trundled into the Chernobyl exclusion zone on 24 February in the early hours of the invasion. According to Davidenko, they crossed over the Pripyat River from Belarus using a pontoon bridge. They then headed towards the Chernobyl nuclear power station, covered with a giant sarcophagus, the scene of the disastrous 1986 accident. By breakfast time they had seized the station. Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home. The Kremlin seemed unaware of – or indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away. The route goes past bucolic mini-lakes and bogs, and past gulls and the odd swan. “On the second day, 1,700 vehicles went through my village,” Davidenko said. “We counted them. They moved in four lanes. There were combat and Mi-2 transport helicopters flying continuously above us in formation, shaking the windows. The Ka-52 attack helicopters flew extremely low, 100 metres from the ground, dipping up and down.” Davidenko, 68, works as a ranger in Chernobyl’s national park. It is situated inside the 30km exclusion zone, which covers 260,000 hectares of territory. The Russian infantry fighting vehicles arriving every few minutes threw up clouds of radioactive dust. Soldiers, meanwhile, worked and slept in Chernobyl’s prohibited deadly red zone, near the abandoned city of Pripyat. Historians may describe what happened around Chernobyl as a case of imperial hubris. Speaking on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin had expected it could seize Kyiv within 48 hours.

Instead, Ukrainian fighters ambushed the column near the city of Ivankiv, down the road from the Chernobyl checkpoint. Davidenko said he and other locals passed on the coordinates of enemy vehicles. This allowed home artillery to target the advance with lethal accuracy. Ukrainian soldiers slipped through the forest on foot or quad bikes, a phantom outfit of partisans. Enraged, the Russians began hunting for Ukrainian “spies”.
