Although the main reason for building them, according to politicians, is to provide a low-carbon form of electricity to combat the climate crisis, no thought seems to have gone into what the climate crisis might do to the nuclear power stations. Prof Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, points out in the Town and Country Planning Association Journal that the eight sites identified in 2011 as suitable for new stations are the same as those identified half a century earlier, on which the first generation of nuclear power stations were built. The reason the sites were originally chosen was their remoteness, for safety, and their proximity to the sea, for cooling purposes. The latest reasoning is that they would have a better chance of public acceptance because two generations of local people have worked in the industry. The new installations are planned to operate for 60 years and will need another century after closure to cool sufficiently to remove the waste. Blowers, an opponent of the government plans, worries that ministers seem to have taken no account of sea level rise, intense storms and the prospect of flooding at these sites."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:56:15Z","webTitle":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK should bar technology developers from working on advanced artificial intelligence tools unless they have a licence to do so, Labour has said. Ministers should introduce much stricter rules around companies training their AI products on vast datasets of the kind used by OpenAI to build ChatGPT, Lucy Powell, Labour’s digital spokesperson, told the Guardian. Her comments come amid a rethink at the top of government over how to regulate the fast-moving world of AI, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, acknowledging it could pose an “existential” threat to humanity. One of the government’s advisers on artificial intelligence also said on Monday that humanity could have only two years before AI is able to outwit people, the latest in a series of stark warnings about the threat posed by the fast-developing technology. Powell said: “My real point of concern is the lack of any regulation of the large language models that can then be applied across a range of AI tools, whether that’s governing how they are built, how they are managed or how they are controlled.” She suggested AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which are governed by arms-length governmental bodies. “That is the kind of model we should be thinking about, where you have to have a licence in order to build these models,” she said. “These seem to me to be the good examples of how this can be done.” The UK government published a white paper on AI two months ago, which detailed the opportunities the technology could bring, but said relatively little about how to regulate it. Since then, a range of developments, including advances in ChatGPT and a series of stark warnings from industry insiders, have caused a rethink at the top of government, with ministers now hastily updating their approach. This week Sunak will travel to Washington DC, where he will argue that the UK should be at the forefront of international efforts to write a new set of guidelines to govern the industry. Labour is also rushing to finalise its own policies on advanced technology. Powell, who will give a speech to industry insiders at the TechUK conference in London on 6 June, said she believed the disruption to the UK economy could be as drastic as the deindustrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is expected to give a speech on the subject during London Tech Week next week. Starmer will hold a shadow cabinet meeting in one of Google’s UK offices next week, giving shadow ministers a chance to speak to some of the company’s top AI executives. Powell said that rather than banning certain technologies, as the EU has done with tools such as facial recognition, she thought the UK should focus on regulating the way in which they are developed. Products such as ChatGPT are built by training algorithms on vast banks of digital information. But experts warn that if those datasets contain biased or discriminatory data, the products themselves can show evidence of those biases. This could have a knock-on effect, for example, on employment practices if AI tools are used to help make hiring and firing decisions. Powell said: “Bias, discrimination, surveillance – this technology can have a lot of unintended consequences.” She argued that by forcing developers to be more open about the data they are using, governments could help mitigate those risks. “This technology is moving so fast that it needs an active, interventionist government approach, rather than a laissez-faire one.” Matt Clifford, the chair of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency, which the government set up last year, said on Monday that AI was evolving much faster than most people realised. He said it could already be used to launch bioweapons or large-scale cyber-attacks, adding that humans could rapidly be surpassed by the technology they had created. Speaking to TalkTV’s Tom Newton Dunn, Clifford said: “It’s certainly true that if we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don’t know how to control it, then that’s going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future. So I think there’s lots of different scenarios to worry about but I certainly think it’s right that it should be very high on the policymakers’ agendas.” Asked when that could happen, he added: “No one knows. There are a very broad range of predictions among AI experts. I think two years will be at the very most sort of bullish end of the spectrum.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T21:30:11Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","fields":{"bodyText":"Keir Starmer has described nuclear power as a “critical part” of the UK’s energy mix and pledged to get stalled projects over the line, as Labour positions itself firmly behind the technology. Before the Labour leader presents his net zero energy policies during a speech in Scotland early next week, the party said it would “push forward” nuclear to boost energy security, cut costs for consumers and create jobs. On Sunday Starmer accused the Conservatives of a “shambolic” failure to open any nuclear power plants during 13 years in power. On Monday he will visit Hinkley Point C in Somerset, one of a number of new plants still not operational despite having been identified in 2009 when Labour was last in power. “My government will lower household energy bills, create jobs and ensure Britain’s energy security. Nuclear is a critical part of the UK’s energy mix,” said Starmer, who claimed Tory failure to approve the new plans had cost 7,000 British jobs. However, another plank of the party’s energy plans came under renewed attack on Sunday from a union that is one of Labour’s biggest donors. Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, accused the Labour party of being naive over its plans to ban North Sea oil and gas production. Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. Smith said Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. Starmer’s promise to block new North Sea oil and gas exploration has received the backing of an eclectic range of high-profile groups, including environmental campaigners, trade unions and even the Women’s Institute. The radical pledge is a key plank of Labour’s environmental platform, but has angered business and political leaders in the north-east of Scotland, where the industry is concentrated. Starmer is being urged to stick to the plan in a letter signed by 139 organisations, including the Countryside Charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. The groups write: “We urge you to stand firm on Labour’s policy of no new oil and gas developments and its significant investment in well-planned, nature-positive renewables and energy efficiency, and to confirm more details on how Labour will support workers to transition from fossil fuels to good quality, secure green jobs during your speech in June.” Shadow ministers confirmed last month that the party intended to ban new domestic oil and gas developments as part of its strategy to achieve zero-carbon power by 2030. Starmer will formally announce the pledge as part of a speech later this month setting out his green agenda in more detail. The plans have drawn fire from Aberdeen-based business leaders and the Tories, with Grant Shapps claiming the policy was an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” and warning it would put jobs at risk and boost Russia’s global power. Shapps, the energy secretary, is due to make a decision within weeks over whether to approve drilling at the giant Rosebank oilfield off Shetland. Comments from Rishi Sunak – who has said it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in new UK oil and gas – have been interpreted as a sign that the government is prepared to give it the green light, although there have been warnings that Labour’s green policies could make it less attractive to investors. In an article for the Times, Ryan Crighton, the policy director of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “If the alternative is importing, at a greater carbon cost, then surely the UK should always favour domestic production, where we can control the regulatory environment.” The high-profile opposition to Labour’s plans has caused concern among environmental groups, with Labour recently having backtracked on a range of other policies, including a pledge to abolish university tuition fees. Starmer is also under pressure from some of his frontbench to change the remit of the party’s £28bn climate fund to allow it to invest in infrastructure projects that are not explicitly green in nature. Tessa Khan, the founder of Uplift, a group that campaigns for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, and which signed the letter, said: “We were disturbed by the way in which Labour’s position to oppose development of new oil and gas field has come under attack in the last week. We wanted to make it clear that it is a core position of the climate sector and more broadly among different sectors in the UK. It’s a mainstream position and backed up by climate science.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations will shut down on Saturday, 12 years after the Fukushima disaster in Japan accelerated the country’s exit from atomic energy. The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the country’s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-Württemberg in the south-west. The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europe’s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites – which provided about 6.5% of the country’s electricity in 2022 – after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the country’s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s. Germany has switched off 16 reactors since 2003. The final shutdowns have raised questions about security of energy supplies and the outlook for Germany’s carbon emissions. The country plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2038, with the first round of closures planned in 2030. However, its parliament approved emergency legislation to reopen mothballed coal-fired power plants to aid electricity generation last year. A push to build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas has also been accelerated since the Ukraine war began. Coal accounted for just over 30% of Germany’s electricity generation in 2022, ahead of wind – responsible for 22%, gas-fired generation at 13% and solar at 10%. Biomass, nuclear and hydroelectric power made up the bulk of the remainder. The thinktank Ember has estimated that Germany and Poland will be the EU’s two largest producers of coal-fired electricity in 2030, responsible for more than half of EU power sector emissions by that point. Advocates of nuclear power argue that it provides a low-carbon, reliable alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Critics say new projects are costly, frequently delayed and present environmental concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association, said the phaseout would worsen carbon emissions and “for a country supposedly renowned for its logical and evidence-driven approach is environmentally damaging, economically illiterate and deeply irresponsible”. He added: “At a time of heightened concern about energy security, Germany will be abandoning assets that can displace 34bn cubic metres of gas a year.” But Tom Burke, chair of the thinktank E3G, played down fears over energy security, and said a mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe meant concerns about power supplies next winter had eased. He said Germany’s renewables industry was growing and that improving grid connections and battery storage across the country would be key to moving the country’s energy system away from fossil fuels. “The coal is mainly being burnt for social and economic reasons, making sure the industry doesn’t shut down all at once,” said Burke. “You cannot have a technology transformation without a social transformation.” Germany’s abandonment of nuclear power is in contrast to the stated ambitions of the UK government, which last month kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear. Ministers have set up a delivery body for new nuclear projects and are running a competition for small nuclear reactors. However, progress on developing two existing large projects, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been slow, with the latter delayed and overbudget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","fields":{"bodyText":"In December, Janica Jammes started a microgreens business in the basement of her home in Big Lake, Minnesota, just across the river from Xcel Energy’s nuclear plant in Monticello. At least once each day, she uses water from her well to nourish the plant trays. She delivers her product to customers within a 10-mile radius and says the business has been a success. But now she worries that her water could be contaminated by a leak of about 400,000 gallons of radioactive water that occurred in November at the plant, which is about 40 miles north-west of Minneapolis. Moreover, Jammes is upset that the company did not alert the public about the leak until March – and then detected a second leak, which the company described as smaller than the first one. “We don’t know for sure if” side-effects from the leaks “will happen or when anything will happen but just the lack of transparency is very concerning”, said Jammes, a 36-year-old mother of four. While Xcel Energy representatives have said the leaks did not affect local drinking water or pose a safety threat to residents, residents such as Jammes want more answers from the company. Independent nuclear energy experts agree that the company should have been more transparent, but they say that based on reports from state and federal agencies, they also do not think the leaks pose a health risk to residents or that the incidents will serve as a significant setback to efforts to promote the carbon-free power source in the US. “This leak, even though it was contained and poses no danger”, according to the official reports, “it should be used as some sort of wake-up call”, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor who specializes in nuclear safety at the University of Southern California. While some scientists see increasing nuclear energy as a crucial, safe way to reducing carbon emissions and increasing the country’s energy independence, the disasters at the Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima nuclear power plants continue to cause fears of the power source. “Nuclear is the only clean energy sector that has the capacity to” transition away from fossil fuels “on a large scale”, said Charlyne Smith, a senior nuclear energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an energy thinktank. “It is an industry that is highly scrutinized compared to other industries, and I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does a really good job at ensuring that safety is something that is practiced in the industry.” Even though Xcel did not announce the leak publicly, they notified the Regulatory Commission, which is a federal agency, and the state and in November, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The company reported that about 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium leaked from a pipe at the facility. The regulators concluded that the spill had not reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources near the plant. “While we immediately informed state and federal agencies, with no immediate safety risk, we focused on investigating the situation and containing the affected water in concert with our regulatory agencies,” Kevin Coss, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, stated in an email to the Guardian. “Making the announcement when we did allowed us to provide the public a more accurate and complete understanding of the leak and our plan to resolve it.” Smith said she agreed that the leak did not pose a significant safety risk but “learning about it months after really doesn’t help the industry”. After the announcement, Xcel held two open houses about the leaks. The company also shut the plant down after discovering the second leak but said it would reopen this week. Jammes was among hundreds of people to attend the meetings. She and others said they were frustrated that there was no presentation about the leaks and that company representatives just stood at tables and answered only some of attendees’ questions. “It was just a quick question and answer sort of thing, like if you have questions, then we’ll try to answer them, but it was very much: you’re going to hear what we want you to hear,” Jammes said. She wants to know why the pipe broke and what Xcel will do to prevent such accidents. Michael Voll, a 60-year-old warehouse associate, also criticized the company’s approach at the meetings. He has lived in Monticello for most his life and said Xcel, which opened the plant in 1971, has benefited the local economy. “You didn’t have to come from a nuclear submarine. You could go out there, and if your uncle or your dad worked there, you probably were going to get a job,” Voll said. He also remains a supporter of nuclear energy and has never feared the plant. But after the leaks and the public meetings, he said his trust in Xcel “is way down”. Xcel sent the pipe that leaked to an independent group, where experts are studying it to determine what caused it to fail, Coss, the Xcel spokesperson stated. “The results will help us understand whether there are other potential steps we need to take at the plant,” he wrote. The company also will conduct a “thorough inspection” of the plant while it’s offline for refueling this month, Coss added. Xcel “will work to maintain” the community’s trust, Coss wrote, “by thoroughly cleaning up the leaked tritium and providing prompt updates if anything about the situation changes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T17:18:08Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is ‘intensifying’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” The negotiations have so far stalled on Russian refusal to withdraw its armed forces from the plant, a Ukrainian precondition for agreement. Grossi has repeatedly warned that a direct hit or a breakdown in safety systems could cause a catastrophe. “What we need is to protect the nuclear power plant, because if we don’t do that, there is a high risk of a major nuclear accident which is going to spare no one, Ukrainians or Russians,” Grossi told reporters on a visit to Washington earlier this month. He said that while he was trying to negotiate a protection zone, it would not try to attribute daily responsibility for the shelling. “I’m still engaged in the effort, so you may understand that it wouldn’t be very wise for me to start saying who is to blame. It’s a process. It is a complex negotiation,” he said. “So this is why we avoid getting into apportioning blame because it will be a never ending story. What we need is an agreement, a solid political commitment, not to do this.” “There is a quite obvious increase in the number of troops on both sides and military equipment,” he told the New York Times this week. “Our teams are also observing and hearing and seeing more military activity, including detonations, regular, almost permanent.” Zaporizhzhia is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, but all six of its reactors have been shut down. Two of them are in “hot shutdown”, meaning they continue to give up a limited amount of energy to power safety and heating systems. It is however a difficult state to maintain, and the 3,000 remaining Ukrainian workers there, a quarter of the normal staff, are facing constant stress and exhaustion. “Things continue but the situation is not sustainable,” Grossi said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T13:36:37Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Here is a film that returns us to a thorny revisionist subject which I haven’t seen aired in documentary form since the film Pandora’s Promise in 2013 – which isn’t mentioned here, though a poster for it is visible in one shot. For many environmentalists, the last realistic hope we have to avert climate disaster is the great unthinkable, the great unmentionable: stop worrying and learn to love nuclear energy, because nuclear is a colossally efficient and very clean energy source. Like Pandora’s Promise, Atomic Hope revisits the case studies of Chornobyl and Fukushima and argues that, although clearly catastrophic, a mythology of horror has grown up around these events that has stymied all debate and shut down thought. The film doesn’t say so, but another way the eco-nuclear movement became tainted was perhaps a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the UN general assembly which made the case in 1989, partly to undermine the coal industry as a trade union powerbase. At any rate, here again is the argument: nuclear energy provides the clean, climate-friendly energy we need. Renewables such as wind and solar are important, but progress on them is desperately slow and time is running out. The risks of nuclear are real, but they are misunderstood and uncontextualised, safety measures have evolved and risk must in any case now be considered in the light of clear and present danger of the global harm from fossil fuels. But none of this is easy. Generations have been brought up on the idea that nuclear equals apocalypse. Convincing them of the opposite is a challenge. Guardian readers will know that George Monbiot has ventilated ideas on this issue. The inevitable question is: what does Greta think? This film was apparently made too late to include Thunberg’s startling intervention in October 2022, when she claimed the German government was wrong to close down nuclear plants in favour of coal. Anything that stimulates discussion of this issue is to be welcomed. • Atomic Hope is released on 17 February in cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is not the only option | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","fields":{"bodyText":"I do not share your enthusiasm for the “good news” that Sizewell C is believed to be safe from Jeremy Hunt’s budgetary cuts (“Britain can’t afford to waver over nuclear power – soon it will be too late”, Editorial). “On a freezing cold, windless, winter’s evening”, Britain’s grid will indeed need an alternative power source to wind or solar, but why is it assumed that only nuclear can provide an alternative base load? And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply – for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate – just two weeks’ ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government’s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants – these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville – still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off “There’s not many left,” noted Peggy O’Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (“Britain’s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration”, Focus). But what your article didn’t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn’t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don’t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell’s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that “reversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests” and a goal that Labour should embrace (“Labour should reverse on not reversing Brexit”, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters’ winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to “Get Brexit Undone” would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK’s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (“Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially “world-leading” renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour’s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize. Investment in green infrastructure and support for green businesses (and the solutions they are creating) is the route to sound money and sustainable growth.

Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was “launching a grassroots community engagement program” under the banner “Time to Talk Nuclear”. He urged Australians to “join the conversation” by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: “What do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?” Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include “supporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technology”. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. Helixos says on its own website that NuScale Power “is reinventing nuclear energy and Helixos is helping them bring it to market”. It adds: “Helixos also provides training for employees to become technology ambassadors and engage with stakeholders and the public.” A search of domain records for O’Brien’s website shows the contact name for the domain registration is Lenka Kollar, a nuclear engineer who co-founded Helixos in 2020. She previously held the role of director of strategy and external relations for NuScale Power. In that previous role, Kollar was “working to bring NuScale’s small modular reactor to market through business plan development and clean energy outreach”, according to a profile published in 2017. Kollar addressed a Global Uranium Conference in Adelaide last month on the topic “reaching net zero with nuclear energy”. In tweets summarising her speech, Kollar said: “The time is now for Australians to have a conversation on nuclear energy and potentially overturn the ban.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is understood O’Brien engaged Helixos – which also does design work – as a contractor to support the development of the website. As part of designing the website it also registered the domain name. A source close to the matter said O’Brien’s team had sought out Helixos, believing it was ideal for the job because of its familiarity with the topic of nuclear energy. But the source said O’Brien had come up with the idea of the survey and the questions, and paid for the work himself. In a written response, O’Brien said the purpose of the survey and the use of collected data had “all been openly and accurately communicated”. “I’m personally paying for the grassroots community campaign ‘Time to Talk Nuclear’ out of my own back pocket because I think it’s an important conversation to have with the Australian people,” O’Brien said. “As we assess the prospect for nuclear energy moving forward, I will continue to seek assistance from people who are experts in the field.” The vice-president of marketing and communications for NuScale Power, Diane Hughes, said: “Helixos does in fact provide services for NuScale Power. “However, outside of providing an example image of our small modular reactor technology, NuScale does not have any involvement in the website, survey, nor outreach on advanced nuclear technologies being conducted by Mr O’Brien.” Helixos and Kollar were also contacted for comment. Helixos describes itself as a business that works “at the intersection of strategy consulting and technical advisory, specialising in cleantech commercialisation” and says it acts in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Helixos’s projects are listed openly on its own website. It works with the Energy Policy Institute of Australia “on editing public policy papers to promote progressive, technology-inclusive energy policy”, including one focusing on “the ability of small modular reactors (SMRs) to support a ‘just transition’ for coal communities in Australia”. Helixos states it worked with SMR Nuclear Technology Pty Ltd “to develop a proactive stakeholder engagement strategy” to “help achieve the main goal of having nuclear energy considered as part of Australia’s future energy mix”. Robert Pritchard, who is both chair of SMR Nuclear Technology and executive director of the Energy Policy Institute of Australia, declined to comment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech that the Coalition wanted “an intelligent conversation on the role that these new-age nuclear technologies might or might not be able to play” in Australia. Announcing the “grassroots community engagement program” on Friday, O’Brien said the starting point would be “an online survey that will open a two-way conversation with the Australian public about the benefits and concerns of advanced nuclear technology becoming part of Australia’s future energy mix”. “Other countries are reducing their emissions while keeping costs down and their network secure with nuclear energy,” O’Brien said. “The question is - should we? Together with the Australian people, let’s find out.” The survey has only three mandatory questions, starting with views on the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia. It then asks what concerns, if any, the participant holds about nuclear energy, followed by any questions they might have. There is an optional section to “stay informed” by submitting an email address and postcode to O’Brien’s team. O’Brien’s website also sets out frequently asked questions such as: “Is nuclear energy clean?” The answer states: “Yes! Nuclear power’s total life-cycle carbon emissions and raw material requirements are the lowest among other energy sources, even lower than wind and solar.” The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously accused the Coalition of pushing the nuclear debate as a “rearguard attempt to undermine and deny the transition to renewables”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T18:08:43Z","webTitle":"Offsite power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant destroyed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","fields":{"bodyText":"A vital offsite electricity supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been destroyed by shelling and there is little likelihood a reliable supply will be re-established, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog chief has said. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The thermal plant was also supplying the surrounding area, which was plunged into darkness. Local Ukrainian officials said work was under way to restore the connection, which has been cut multiple times this week. Grossi, who said he had been informed of the situation by IAEA representatives at the plant, called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area”. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” he said, without apportioning blame for the shelling. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling near Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and within the perimeter of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has six reactors. The thermal supply has been cut and restored multiple times this week and Enerhodar, the nearby town, has suffered several complete blackouts. When the thermal supply has been cut the plant has relied on its only remaining operating reactor for the power needed for cooling and other safety functions. This method is designed to provide power only for a few hours at a time. Diesel generators are used as a last resort. The constant destruction of thermal power supply has led Ukraine to consider shutting down the remaining operating reactor, said Grossi. Ukraine “no longer [has] confidence in the restoration of offsite power”, he said. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for the nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said. Enerhodar’s mayor in exile, Dmytro Orlov, said on Friday that work was under way to fix the switchyard and restore the supply from the thermal plant to the town, most of which was still suffering a blackout. The development came as diplomats from Canada and Poland prepare to submit a draft resolution to be voted on by the IAEA’s board of governors, according to Reuters. The IAEA acts the international nuclear watchdog under the United Nations. The draft text, seen by Reuters, implores Russia to leave the power plant and for control over the plant to be given to the competent authorities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The text is expected to be passed, according to diplomats cited by Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T22:08:01Z","webTitle":"California’s last nuclear power plant gets $1bn funding to extend life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","fields":{"bodyText":"California’s last nuclear plant could get a new lease on life after the Biden administration announced the approval of up to $1.1bn in conditional funding on Monday. The grant funds may offer a path to keeping the ageing facility known as Diablo Canyon online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2025. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the plant has faced a spate of controversies over the decades, for its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines. Its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But concerns over the state’s ability to generate enough green energy to fill the gap left by the plant’s closure grew as the deadline neared. The state is far from finding a reliable and climate-conscious replacement for the energy produced by the plant. The largest single-source provider in the state generates more than 8% of California’s electricity, enough to supply more than 3 million residents. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. It’s an issue being grappled with in states across the US. The nuclear power industry’s 92 reactors generate more than half of the country’s virtually carbon-free electricity, but about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas. As part of its effort to fight the climate crisis, the Biden administration set aside these grant funds to keep struggling nuclear plants online. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has also been among those strongly advocating for extending the life of Diablo Canyon, thereby giving the state more time to complete its ambitious green energy transition. In September, the governor pushed state lawmakers to approve a $1bn loan to keep the facility running an additional five years. The federal funds – the terms of which are still being negotiated – would help cover operating costs and be doled out over the course of four years. Diablo Canyon still has obstacles to cross though, most significantly the need for a renewed license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Significant upgrades were needed to ensure the plant could continue to operate safely and sustainably. And there are still vocal critics of any plan to keep it open. “The danger of Diablo Canyon is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there’s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition,” said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate and clean energy program, who helped negotiated the plant’s decommission. Critics also highlight how the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste. Suzanne Hosn, a spokesperson for PG&amp;E, the utility company that operates the plant, said Diablo can “safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding”. Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes. Calling nuclear the “nation’s largest source of clean electricity”, US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, said the grant was a “critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power”. Biden has set a goal of decarbonizing the grid by 2035, and the administration is relying on nuclear energy to play a part. The grant is intended to ensure that plants like Diablo Canyon can stay afloat. “We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,” Granholm said.

A deal between Ineos, one of the UK’s biggest privately owned companies, and FTSE 100 engineer Rolls-Royce could help Ineos with the tricky task of decarbonising the giant refinery, while also providing Rolls-Royce with an early customer for a new technology it hopes will transform its prospects. Rolls-Royce’s main business is building and maintaining jet engines for commercial aeroplanes, as well as power systems for boats and land vehicles. However, it is one of a handful of companies around the world hoping to use the expertise gained from building nuclear reactors for the UK’s submarine fleet for use on land. Ineos, which produces fuel and the chemicals used in plastics, is planning to use hydrogen to power the Grangemouth plant, which employs about 2,000 people across nearly 700 hectares (1,700 acres) of land. However, creating zero-carbon hydrogen from water requires large amounts of electricity, and it is considering options to source that power. Ratcliffe is regularly counted among the UK’s richest people, although he moved to low-tax Monaco in 2020. He has used the £6bn fortune built up from Ineos to pursue various other interests, including a delayed attempt to build a rugged off-road vehicle, and purchases of several sports clubs. He has previously tried to buy Chelsea football club, and is seen as a possible bidder for Manchester United after its owners put it up for sale this month. The talks between Ineos and Rolls-Royce were still at an early stage, said one person with knowledge of the situation. Another person said that discussions had centred on understanding the technology, and that no commercial negotiations have taken place. The Sunday Telegraph first reported the contacts. The former prime minister Boris Johnson aimed to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s energy strategy in April as he responded to the chaos on global energy markets prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As well as building several large reactors capable of generating gigawatts of power, he also gave his approval to efforts to build megawatt-scale small modular reactors (SMRs). Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s outgoing chief executive, has said that the SMR revenues could end up being many times larger than its current business, as global demand for zero-carbon energy increases during the transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company still has a host of regulatory and political and financial problems to overcome, as well as proving that it can actually build the reactors in a factory at a cost to make them viable. However, Rolls-Royce is working to find locations for reactors. In September, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Czech nuclear engineering firm Škoda JS to look at sites in the Czech Republic and other parts of central Europe. Rolls-Royce this month said it was prioritising four sites of old nuclear reactors in the UK to install the new SMRs. They were Trawsfynydd and Wylfa in north Wales, a site near Sellafield in Cumbria, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. East will hand over the reins of the company to the ex-BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic in January, although the SMR effort is being headed internally by Tom Samson, who last week told a parliamentary committee that the company wanted to begin formal funding talks with the UK government. Ineos and Rolls-Royce declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T22:23:10Z","webTitle":"IAEA to inspect future nuclear-powered submarines built in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog will insist on inspecting Australia’s future nuclear submarines before and after deployments as part of a “watertight” agreement to ensure no fissile material is diverted, the agency’s chief has said. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the agency and the partners in the Aukus nuclear sharing agreement – the US, UK and Australia – will hold further negotiations on how to make sure it does not conflict with their non-proliferation obligations. The Aukus deal exploits a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty that allows nuclear fuel used for non-explosive military uses like naval propulsion to be exempted from IAEA inspections. As one of the ways of limiting the possibility that fissile material could be diverted to making weapons, nuclear fuel will be delivered to Australia in welded power units which would be installed in submarines to be assembled by Australia and ready by the 2040s. Grossi said that in negotiations with Australia, the IAEA would insist that its inspectors would be allowed to check the amount of nuclear fuel in the sealed units before and after the submarines put out to sea. “We have to check before it goes in the water, and when it comes back,” Grossi told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. “This requires highly sophisticated technical methods, because there will be welded units, [but] our inspectors will want to know what is inside and whether, when the boat comes back to port, everything is there and there has not been any loss. It’s the first time something like this will be done.” “We are going to be very demanding on what they are planning to do. So the process starts now. And the proof of the pudding is in the tasting,” Grossi said. Grossi is due to report on progress on the non-proliferation agreements related to the Aukus deal to the member states on the IAEA’s board in June. “We are going to put together a solid watertight system to try to have all the guarantees. If we cannot do that, we would never agree,” Grossi said. Arms control advocates have generally welcomed the precautionary measures adopted by the Aukus partners, but have expressed concern that the precedent it sets could encourage other states to use the NPT loophole potentially to use the pretext of developing nuclear naval propulsion as a way of hiding work on weapons. “If it was the case that country X wants to do this, they will have to do the exact same thing if they want to stay within the law,” Grossi said. “They will have to come to us. They will have to inform us what they are planning to do, and they will have to open a process of consultation and negotiation.” China has strenuously objected to the deal and its foreign ministry has alleged that the Aukus partners had “coerced” the IAEA into accepting it. “Countries have strong feelings about it,” Grossi said, but he added: “Nobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T04:07:17Z","webTitle":"‘A form of self-destruction’: Japan weighs up plan to expand nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Look carefully through the trees, and it is just possible to catch sight of Onagawa nuclear power plant from its visitors’ centre, perched on a hill surrounded by thick woods. The plant’s supporters may have had its remote location, on a rugged peninsula in Japan’s north-east, in mind when they campaigned to bring nuclear power – and the promise of subsidies – to the town more than 40 years ago. Despite its seclusion, the plant is now in the political spotlight, as Japan prepares to again put its faith in nuclear power, more than a decade after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. In a sweeping change to the country’s energy policy, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced plans to build next-generation reactors and restart those left idle after the 2011 triple meltdown, in an attempt to end Japan’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and help meet its net zero target by 2050. Kishida’s “green transformation”, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the current maximum of 60 years, underlines Japan’s struggle to secure an affordable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and a power crunch that has triggered warnings of potential blackouts in Tokyo during this summer’s heatwave. Most of Japan’s nuclear power plants have remained offline since the Fukushima meltdown, and previous governments indicated they would not build new reactors or replace ageing ones, fearing a backlash from a shaken and sceptical public. Japan plans for nuclear to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030, compared with about a third before Fukushima. In 2020 the figure was less than 5%. Just 10 nuclear reactors among more than 30 have been restarted since the post-Fukushima introduction of stricter safety standards. If Kishida gets his way though, seven additional reactors will be restarted after next summer, including the No. 2 unit at Onagawa, which sustained structural damage from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami but escaped a catastrophic meltdown despite being the closest atomic plant to the quake’s epicentre. ‘A threat to the safety of local people’ The restart has been approved by Japan’s nuclear watchdog and given “local consent” by Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi – the prefecture where Onagawa is located. But many residents argue that contingency plans for potential accidents would put lives at risk. “The evacuation plans won’t work … they are a threat to the safety of local people,” says Masami Hino, one of 17 residents living within 30km of the plant who last year launched a legal action to block the restart, now scheduled for early 2024. In the event of a serious accident, 1,000 residents living within 5km of the plant would leave immediately, while 190,000 people within a 30km radius would evacuate in stages, according to the official blueprint. “There will be huge traffic jams, and we won’t be able to escape,” says Hino, who cited one expert simulation – dismissed by local authorities – showing that it could take up to five days for everyone to make it to safety. “If there is an accident it is ridiculous to think that people will leave in an orderly way,” he said. “They will just get out as quickly as they can and then get stuck for days without food, water or access to toilets.” Critics say an evacuation in the wake of an accident would clog the area’s narrow, winding roads, leaving people at risk of exposure to radiation. Most would leave in private cars, but others would have to board buses. The plant’s operator, Tohoku Electric Power, and local authorities would provide almost 1,000 staff to screen people for radiation exposure before directing them to temporary shelters. “How can Tohoku Electric and the prefecture guarantee that an evacuation would go smoothly after something like a major earthquake? It’s impossible,” says Mikiko Abe, an independent member of the Onagawa town assembly who has spent 40 years campaigning for the plant’s closure. “Instead of planning for an evacuation, wouldn’t it be better to live safely in a place where there’s no need to even think about fleeing our homes?” Kishida’s response to energy insecurity and the climate crisis has won the backing of Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), who said restarting more nuclear plants in Japan – one of the world’s biggest consumers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) – would free up more LNG and help ease Europe’s energy supply fears during the winter. Domestic opposition to a bigger role for nuclear in the energy mix appears to be weakening. A poll by the Nikkei business paper in June found that 53% of respondents agreed with putting reactors back into service if their safety could be assured – the first time that support for restarts had exceeded opposition since the 2011 triple disaster. While pro-nuclear members of the Miyagi prefectural assembly have helped resist calls for a referendum, a poll in April by the local Kahoku Shinpo newspaper found that 56% of residents were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed the restart. “All of Japan’s nuclear power plants are on the coast … and this is a country that has earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes,” says Tsuyoshi Suda, a member of local anti-nuclear group Kaze no Kai, as he looked at the plant – complete with a newly built 29-metre high seawall – from a nearby beach. “For Japan to keep putting its faith in nuclear power plants is like a form of self-destruction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain’s urgent need to commit to nuclear power | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"bodyText":"For a moment last week, our cash-strapped government seemed ready to abandon a project that many experts believe is central to our plans of achieving energy independence and net zero emissions. According to the BBC, the Treasury had indicated the proposed new nuclear reactor Sizewell C was on a list of major construction projects that were under review for possible cancellation. Its days could be numbered, it was suggested. The threat has since been denied by Number 10. The new atom plant in Suffolk will go ahead, it has insisted. For a nation that hopes to wean itself off its fossil fuel addiction and its dependence on natural gas imports, this is good news. The UK’s future prosperity depends on its ability to generate electricity, independently and at low cost and nuclear power is expected to play a critical role in ensuring this happens. The trouble is that these plans have very shaky foundations, as was revealed last week when uncertainties about Sizewell C first surfaced. Britain has pledged to close all its coal power plants by 2024 while those that burn oil and gas are to be phased out by 2035. After that, a mix of renewables and nuclear plants is expected to fill this capacity, lighting and warming our homes, running our factories and keeping our trains and electric cars moving. For their part, renewables are doing well, with wind and solar plants providing healthy chunks of power for the UK grid. This is not the case for the nuclear component of this energy package, however. Just as the nation’s fossil fuel plants are being closed down, reactors have been providing less and less power for the nation. In the 1990s, atomic power generated 25% of Britain’s electricity. By 2020, this figure had dropped to 16% and it will continue to decline as more of our ageing nuclear plants are closed. Of the six reactors currently in operation, five are destined for closure by 2028. One additional new reactor, Hinkley Point C, should be in operation by then, leaving Britain with two reactors and limited fossil fuel provision – in addition to renewable sources – to supply power for the nation. Unless new reactors are built, by 2050 British nuclear capacity – the proposed cornerstone of the nation’s energy supply for the future – will be a third of what it is today. Solar and wind power will no doubt do their bit but on a freezing cold, windless, winter evening, the UK’s lack of a central generating capacity will be cruelly exposed. Blackouts will be inevitable. The proposed Sizewell C reactor will therefore be welcome, though on its own the plant will be insufficient for the nation’s needs. Britain will require at least half a dozen such reactors to provide the gigawatts of electricity on which it will depend to fend off a future that lacks power to run our homes and operate our factories. The problem is that a new nuclear plant takes around a decade to build once it has been approved. By that arithmetic, time is now desperately tight if the United Kingdom is to have the numbers it requires to generate the power the country is going to need. Nuclear energy is certainly not without flaws. Construction costs and waste storage are two clear examples. However, the government has committed the nation to atomic power. Having done so, it is now obliged to act with a speed that will provide the country with sufficient nuclear electricity – and keep the lights on over the next two decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T19:14:06Z","webTitle":"Germany delays exit from nuclear power to offset energy shortfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s planned exit from nuclear power by the end of this year has been officially delayed in order to shore up energy supplies during an expected shortfall this winter, the economic minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Tuesday. The decision follows a shortage in supplies of electricity coming from France due to the fact that more than half of its nuclear power stations are offline, Habeck told journalists in Berlin. He said that the resulting gap in electricity supplies was being “observed with concern”, with Europe’s energy network in danger of being put under too much strain, potentially leading to power cuts. The electricity that Germany is not able to acquire from France is being compensated for with electricity produced by gas-fired power stations in Germany. But this in turn involves using up valuable supplies of gas that Germany is trying to save before winter arrives. Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations were due to be turned off at the end of this year, the end of an 11-year process. The decision to withdraw from nuclear power was made by the government of Angela Merkel after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Habeck had long resisted calls for the power plants in southern Germany – Isar 2 and Neckarwestheim 2 – to be extended as Germany coped with the effect of Russia slowing down, and then turning off completely, its gas supply via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 earlier this month. But his arguments against keeping the plants in operation became increasingly difficult to defend. A majority of Germans, despite being in favour of moving away from nuclear power, has said it is in favour of extending the plants’ use temporarily. Habeck had announced earlier this month that the plants would be put into a standby mode but would effectively stay offline unless needed. His decision amounts to an awkward U-turn, though Habeck said it was a reaction to the current situation, including what he called an escalation of the situation in Russia, “which is developing fairly dramatically”, and that he was resistant to populist demands. Habeck said that the necessary changes to the law covering the extension of the plants would be voted on in the Bundestag at the end of next month. Reacting to security concerns, and whether nuclear plants may be open to hacking attacks and terrorist threats, Habeck said the government was well aware of the concerns and was “doing its utmost” to secure them. German and Danish authorities were examining evidence on Tuesday suggesting that the Nord Stream pipelines 1 and 2 may have been deliberately damaged on Monday night in an act of sabotage, after dramatic drops of pressure in them and evidence of gas leaking into the Baltic Sea with possible explosions. Fingers have inevitably been pointed at Russia as a possible culprit. The incident has heightened concerns over the vulnerability of energy infrastructure in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T18:25:50Z","webTitle":"Wood burning stoves and the harm done by inflating the risk of nuclear power | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","fields":{"bodyText":"Your article on the harmful effects of burning wood (‘Eco’ wood burners produce 450 times more pollution than gas heating – report, 8 December) highlights a broader problem with risk management in public health. Very different values are placed on human life, depending on the specific risk. The level of air pollutants considered acceptable by the World Health Organization is already dangerous, increasing mortality by 2%. In contrast, the level of radioactivity considered acceptable is 100-500 times below levels that cause a similar increase in mortality. What this means is that a life lost to air pollution is valued 100- to 500-fold lower than a life lost to exposure to radioactivity. It is partly because of this difference, and the resulting regulatory regimes, that coal-fired power stations are much cheaper to build than nuclear power stations, even though they are at least 500 times more dangerous. It is only because of concerns about the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change that countries are now considering alternatives to coal, including nuclear power. If we had, from the outset, valued lives lost to air pollution the same as lives lost to radioactivity, we would have been building nuclear power plants rather than coal-fired power plants for the past 40 years. Many millions of lives would have been saved, and the climate emergency might have been avoided. Anton van der Merwe Oxford • Your article about wood burning stoves seems to be yet another example of individuals being made to feel responsible for the world’s environmental woes while governments and business pay little more than lip service to such issues. The wood that I burn is collected within a five-mile radius of my home, and I would guess that most wood burned domestically is similarly local. By contrast, Drax power station, about 15 miles from me, burns millions of tons of woodchips imported from forests in North America and elsewhere, brought here in huge, polluting tankers. But because it is called “biomass”, it attracts billions of pounds in government subsidies. While I am concerned about pollution, I will be continuing to burn biomass, without subsidy, for the foreseeable future.

Scientists have used eye and earwitnesses accounts, along with data from tide gauges, satellites, evidence of broken windows and other sources, to calculate that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which occurred on 15 January 2022 and was felt around the world, likely involved five blasts. The last of them released energy equivalent to about 15 megatonnes of TNT. That is around 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and puts the volcanic event on a par with the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the US: the Castle Bravo bomb detonated at Bikini Atoll in 1954. The team, based at institutions in the US and New Zealand, added that the volcanic event, which occurred 65km (40 miles) from the country’s main island, involved both eruptions – which resulted in huge volcanic plumes being thrust into the stratosphere – and explosions of steam, which caused sonic booms and were the main cause of the related tsunami. The researchers’ computer simulations of the event, based on a combination of data sources, suggest the western coast of Tofua Island experienced waves of up to 45 metres in height, a result they say is backed up by signs of vegetation scars at the same altitude captured by satellite and drone data. The eruption brought reports of people experiencing the ground and buildings shaking for hours as far away as Fiji – nearly 500 miles away. It is thought that six people died as a result of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic event, including four people in Tonga and two in Peru who drowned as a result of abnormally large waves caused by the volcanic activity. The team say the huge waves in parts of Tonga would have been expected to result in a larger death toll – yet this was not the case. “The main factors that led to this, we suggest, are the quirk of the location, a worldwide pandemic, and increased evaluation drills and awareness efforts carried out in the years prior,” they write in the journal Science Advances. Tofua is uninhabited and other areas that experienced large waves were sparsely populated, while tourist resorts were closed because of Covid. “The main settlements in all of Tonga safely face Nuku’alofa Lagoon, the best possible scenario to duck the full brunt of a mega-tsunami,” the authors note, adding that other inhabited islands sit atop a carbonate platform where shallow waters damped down the waves. The new study follows research published last year that revealed that the Tonga volcano eruption had the highest plume ever recorded, with an ash cloud that reached 57km (35 miles) in height. Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh of the University of Bath, who was not involved in the new study but has also carried out research into the event, said the latest work offered the most detailed modelling of the Tonga tsunami so far by benefiting from a diverse observation dataset. “Modelling tsunamis from volcano eruptions is a challenging task and this has been nicely done by [the team],” he said. “It is interesting that the results are consistent with our previous study on this event, where we reported a maximum tsunami wave height of 90m.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T16:39:35Z","webTitle":"German chancellor rejects calls to reverse nuclear power plant closures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","fields":{"bodyText":"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has rejected calls for his government to commit to a longer-term extension of the life of the country’s nuclear power plants and insisted that Europe’s largest economy would have enough energy to get through the winter. Scholz shut down criticism from the opposition conservative alliance and at least one leading economist, who have described his coalition’s decision to keep two remaining reactors in emergency reserve rather than letting them produce electricity, as “madness” while the government refuses to reverse its long-term plan to close down the last remaining plants. Criticism about the nuclear roadmap is also coming from within Scholz’s government. His coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, has urged Scholz to overturn the 2011 ban on nuclear power introduced by Angela Merkel as a reaction to the Fukushima disaster. In a heated parliamentary debate on Wednesday morning, Scholz defended his government’s strategy to tackle the energy crisis. Facing fierce criticism from the opposition, he said his government was confronting problems created by the previous administration under Merkel – in which he served. The crisis, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has been exacerbated in recent weeks by Moscow’s reduction of gas supplies to Germany, which was followed a week ago by a complete halt. Moscow has cited maintenance issues linked to sanctions imposed by the west. Scholz accused Friedrich Merz’s conservative alliance (CDU/CSU) of refusing to accept responsibility for its role in the crisis, calling it “the party which holds complete responsibility for the fact that Germany made decisions to withdraw both from coal and from atomic energy, but never had the strength to enter into anything else”. He also accused the conservatives of failing to embrace renewable energy and actively campaigning against it. “You were incapable of bringing about the expansion of renewable energies. You led defensive battles against every single wind turbine,” he said. By trying now to save as much gas, electricity and oil as it can before winter kicks in – in part with the construction of LNG terminals and expanding renewable energy – Scholz said his government was “solving problems that the union failed to recognise as such when it was in power”. Scholz said Germans would “rise above themselves” and deal with the coming winter with “with boldness and bravery” and said that Germany was close to its goal of becoming independent from Russian gas exports. Gas storage facilities were 86% full on Wednesday. Merz accused Scholz’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, of “pandering to environmental lobbyists” and squandering the chance to find solutions to the energy crisis by seeking what he called a “lazy compromise” by refusing to allow Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations to continue operation for the next two to three years. On Monday Habeck had announced that two of them would remain “on standby” supported by the necessary staff, equipment and security, but would not be producing electricity unless needed. Merz said the decision was irresponsible, arguing that continuing running the plants would help secure energy supplies and that the increased electricity production would help control the market price. “The ignorance shown to this topic is written all over your face,” he said to Habeck, calling the last existing nuclear power plants “the most modern and safe reactors in the world”. In Wednesday’s Bundestag debate, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right AfD, accused the government of leading Germany to financial ruin with its policies, including a €65bn (£56bn) package announced on Sunday, aimed to ease household finances. “You have every reason to fear a heated autumn and winter,” she said, in reference to figures on the right and left who have called for protests against high living costs. She said people had “every right” to take to the streets. Amira Mohamed Ali, parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke, accused the coalition government of having “no social conscience”. She urged the government to approach Russia in an attempt to bring it to the negotiating table and end its hostilities in Ukraine. The instability of nuclear power is one of the main reason for not relying on it, the economics ministry argued when it presented its plans on Monday. Currently only 28 of 56 plants in France are on the grid, due in part to the shortage of cooling water linked to this summer’s drought, meaning Germany has had to supply its neighbour with electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T05:38:03Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Korea’s nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has said North Korea intends to have the world’s most powerful nuclear force as the leader was again pictured with his daughter while inspecting troops and an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s “ultimate goal is to possess the world’s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the century”, Kim said in an order promoting dozens of military officers involved in the launch last weekend of a new ballistic missile, state media reported on Sunday. He described the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as the “world’s strongest strategic weapon” and said it demonstrated North Korea’s resolve and ability to eventually build the world’s strongest army, which would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people. State media also showed Kim being accompanied on a military review by his daughter, whose existence had never been publicly confirmed before last weekend’s Hwasong-17 test. Ju Ae is estimated to be about 12 or 13 years of age, which means that in about four to five years she will be preparing to attend university or go into military service, Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said last week. State media news agency KCNA described her as Kim’s “most beloved” or “precious” child, a more honorific title than her previous description of Kim’s “beloved” child on its dispatch the previous week. Her second appearance will raise the prospect that leadership of the totalitarian state could pass to a fourth generation of Kims. Kim is believed to have as many as three children – two girls and a boy, experts said. Some observers believed one of those children was seen in footage of celebrations for a national holiday in September. In Sunday’s report, Kim was also quoted as saying North Korean scientists had made a “wonderful leap forward in the development of the technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles” and were expected to expand and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Kim was pictured in photos posing with scientists, engineers and military officials involved in the test. According to state media, those workers pledged to defend the “absolute authority” of the party and Kim, and vowed that “our missiles will fly vigorously only in the direction indicated” by Kim. Capable of reaching the US mainland, the launch of the Hwasong-17 on 19 November prompted the US to call for a United Nations security council presidential statement to hold North Korea accountable for its missile tests, which are banned by security council resolutions. North Korea’s powerful standing committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly awarded the Hwasong-17 missile the title of “DPRK hero and gold star medal and order of national flag 1st class”, state news agency KCNA reported in another statement, using the initials of the country’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “[The missile] clearly proved before the world that the DPRK is a full-fledged nuclear power capable of standing against the nuclear supremacy of the US imperialists and fully demonstrated its might as the most powerful ICBM state,” KCNA said.

Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but admitted that his forces had also been “badly damaged”. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, arrived at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday. He has described the situation there as very dangerous, and told Russian media outlets during the visit that “the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” The Danish energy agency says that an object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. The US has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, according to Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Germany at a crossroads: what a nuclear power station tells us about its energy dilemma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","fields":{"bodyText":"On a slope above the river Neckar in south-west Germany, about 25 miles (40km) from Stuttgart, stands the village of Neckarwestheim, its red terracotta roofs surrounded by vineyards and farmers’ fields, with streets leading to a central market square. So far, so typical for a rural community in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. However, this settlement of 4,200 residents has one defining characteristic: it is located right next to one of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations. The challenges facing this picturesque village illustrate how the energy crisis is affecting Europe’s largest economy, as Russia’s weaponisation of the gas supply has complicated Germany’s planned transition away from nuclear. On a crisp, clear autumn day, clouds of steam rise from the Neckarwestheim nuclear plant’s pressurised water reactor, pale against the hill at whose feet it stands. For those prepared to live with a reactor as a neighbour, its arrival in the mid-70s heralded a golden age. The site’s first reactor stopped producing power in 2011, while the second has been operational since 1989. “Everyone’s dreams came true,” says Jochen Winkler, the mayor of Neckarwestheim, from his office overlooking the main square of the village, which will celebrate its 900th birthday in 2023. In more recent times, the village has flourished; its population has doubled over the four decades the power station has been there. Winkler reels off a list of the amenities enjoyed by residents, from a sports hall and a cultural centre to subsidised childcare and even, once upon a time, “welcome money” paid to the parents of newborns, all thanks to local business taxes collected from the power station. Its owner is EnBW – a majority state-owned and publicly traded energy company, whose name stands for Energy Baden-Württemberg. “We had an income equivalent to that of communities which are three or four times our size,” says Winkler. But this is coming to an end, and Neckarwestheim II is living on borrowed time, limiting the local authority’s largesse. Along with Germany’s two other remaining nuclear power stations, it was supposed to be turned off by the end of the year, undergoing the final stage of an 11-year phase-out process initiated by Angela Merkel’s government after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, the urgent need to ensure winter energy supply as Russia throttled flows of gas into Europe led the federal government in Berlin to grant a stay of execution. All three operating nuclear reactors – Neckarwestheim, Isar II in neighbouring Bavaria, and Emsland in the north-west close to the Dutch border – are now permitted to run until the middle of April next year. Neckarwestheim’s contribution to Germany’s electricity is not insignificant: it generated 11bn kWh of electricity in 2021. The reactor provides a sixth of the total electricity consumption in the industry-heavy state – home to significant manufacturing operations including several car plants – or two-thirds of the total electricity demand of the state’s 5m households. “People who are afraid of or have a problem with nuclear power don’t live here. New citizens who have a problem with it don’t move here,” says Winkler. That statement certainly holds for Melita Marinkovic, out walking her puppy with her 12-year-old son, who has just moved here from Ludwigsburg, 15 miles south. “If there was a problem with the reactor, they would also be affected in Ludwigsburg,” she says. Like many of her neighbours, she thinks it’s a shame the power plant is being turned off: “It’s a good source of clean energy.” Residents’ views contrast with prevailing public opinion in Germany, where the existing anti-nuclear movement gained prominence after the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, as fears grew about the risks of nuclear power. Despite Germany’s temporary extension, opponents and environmental groups continue their demonstrations. Sporting an anti-nuclear badge on his jumper, Frank Wagner, from the mid-Neckar federation of citizens’ action groups, fears the current nuclear extension is just the thin end of the wedge. “This step shows us that the dam has been breached, which makes it quite easy to say in the coming months, ‘Oh, we’ve still got an energy shortage, we need the nuclear power plants for longer,’” Wagner says. He is also concerned that no location has yet been found for the permanent storage of Germany’s nuclear waste; the discussions are expected to last nearly 30 years. Dr Andre Baumann, Baden-Württemberg’s undersecretary of state for the environment, climate and energy, insists that the April extension will be the last. The Green politician, whose party returned last year to national government as part of a three-way coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Free Democrats (FDP), is adamant that no new fuel rods will be bought for Neckarwestheim, which would be necessary to keeping it running beyond April. For some, April is too late. After a previous year’s safety check at the reactor revealed cracks in pressure generator heating pipes, two local people decided to take their complaint to court. Their case will be heard later this month. The reactor’s owner, EnBW, says the plant has a “very high level of safety, also in international comparisons”. It adds that a previous court ruling found there was no reason to intervene in the operations of the reactor. The state government, with responsibility for nuclear oversight, says it is also satisfied that the plant can run safely. Apologising for the cool temperature in his office – the environment ministry has set its thermostats to 19C – Baumann says: “We mustn’t forget what’s important. We have to continue saving energy. “We have to adapt our energy system for the future. That means renewables, renewables, renewables. The setup costs are considerably lower than for new nuclear, coal or gas plants.” But the Energiewende, or energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, of which Germany was an early adopter, appears to have stalled in recent years. Many complain that plans to transport more wind power generated in the blustery north to the energy-hungry industrial south hit obstacles as far back as 2014. While the phase-out of nuclear and fossil fuels has been planned for years, the war has forced national energy policy to swerve in the other direction. Germany is racing to finish five terminals to receive liquid natural gas (LNG), and last week signed a 15-year deal with Qatar to receive new flows of LNG from 2026. Coal also continues to play a role. A recent lack of wind has prompted Germany to burn more of it, accounting for 45% of all energy generation. This was up from 31% in the first half of 2022, according to official statistics, when almost half (49%) came from renewable sources. Some analysts are concerned that the final shutdown of nuclear, which accounted for 6% of total electricity generation in the first six months of the year, will also leave a gap. In Neckarwestheim, the authorities have developed two solar installations, but Winkler says the process of obtaining permits for new developments is lengthy and time-consuming. Dr Gottfried Kazenwadel’s is the fourth generation in his family to farm crops and grow wine nearby. The chair of the local agricultural association is generally in favour of the nuclear switch-off, and like many Germans, would prefer the country to accelerate the development of renewable energy. He jokes that the village’s name was often left off the packaging for local agricultural produce. “Neckarwestheim was always in the news,” he says, “especially when the second reactor was built, which wasn’t necessarily good for marketing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:30:43Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer pledges ‘good, union jobs’ amid energy row with GMB","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","fields":{"bodyText":"Keir Starmer will pledge to put “good, union jobs” at the heart of Labour’s energy policy during a speech to one of its biggest donor unions after its general secretary criticised a proposed ban on oil and gas expansion. He will speak at the GMB’s annual conference on Tuesday, a day after he tried to calm a growing rift with its leadership over Labour’s energy policy. In a speech pledging to put workers at the heart of the party’s planned transition to green energy, the Labour leader will also seek to portray the prime minister as London-centric and overly concerned with banking. “If the City of London races ahead while the rest of Britain stagnates, as long as there was a hint of growth on his spreadsheet, Rishi Sunak would think that’s fine. But it’s not,” Starmer will tell the GMB congress in Brighton. “If you leave this many people behind, a nation cannot grow fairly. We can’t do it with low wages. We can’t do it with insecure jobs and bad work, with a stand-aside state that doesn’t fight for the future, without a proper industrial strategy.” Starmer – who is likely to be challenged on his opposition towards Labour MPs joining picket lines – will also pledge that Labour in government will work with unions, strengthening their role in society and urging businesses such as Amazon to recognise them. “We can create a new business model for Britain, one which creates economic security and grows not just our productivity, but our hope and our optimism. Labour in government will work with unions. We will always see the fight for working people as our driving purpose.” His appearance comes amid discontent among Labour’s union base over a pledge to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power. The party is proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said on Sunday that Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. In an apparent attempt to reassure union critics, Starmer stressed on Monday that “oil and gas will be part of our energy mix for many, many years to come”. Speaking during a visit to the Hinkley C nuclear power project in Somerset, he said: “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to seize the jobs of the future. Oil and gas will be part of that because, where there are existing licences, they will go on to the 2050s.” However, only a couple of hours later Smith used a speech to the Brighton conference to reiterate his criticism, urging Labour to focus on a “mix of energy sources” if it gains power, including oil and gas. He said that – while the union wanted a Labour government – he disagreed with its energy policy. “We have to fix and secure our energy supply if we are to face down threats from authoritarian regimes in the world and find a workable way to achieve net zero,” Smith said. The Unite union has also criticised Labour’s stance. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, said last week that the UK needed a properly planned transition that would “guarantee jobs, pay and conditions for all the tens of thousands of workers in the North Sea and supporting industries”. Starmer’s plans have received significant support from a range of high-profile groups, including other trade unions, environmental campaigners and even the Women’s Institute. Last year, Unite and the GMB each gave Labour about £1.2m. Starmer said on Monday that Labour talks to the GMB “all the time”. Energy policy is expected to be a key battleground for Labour in the run-up to the next election. The energy crisis, provoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has fuelled debate over Britain’s energy security and plans for green jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:22:06Z","webTitle":"Russia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","fields":{"bodyText":"The Belarusian ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, has said that Russia has begun moving tactical nuclear warheads for storage to Belarus, adding that it was possible that the weapons had already arrived in his country. “We had to prepare storage facilities and the rest over there [in Belarus]. We’ve done all of that. This is why the relocation of nuclear munitions began,” Lukashenko said during a summit of the Eurasian Economic Forum in Moscow. Asked if the weapons had already arrived, he said: “Maybe. I will go and take a look.” The remarks came hours after Russian and Belarusian military officials signed a pact that provides for Moscow to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, marking a shift in the Kremlin’s nuclear posture that could raise the stakes of any future instability in Belarus. The plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on foreign soil is Russia’s first since 1991. The Kremlin has defended the decision saying that it is being provoked by western powers supporting Ukraine. Russia has said it will maintain control over the tactical nuclear weapons, which may be launched on Iskander-M missiles or from Su-25 planes, both of which Belarus has in its arsenal. Belarus borders three Nato countries and has missiles that could reach several capitals. The US also has about 100 such weapons stationed at bases around Europe. The transfer will further align Russia and Belarus’ militaries as Russia seeks a closer alliance with Minsk, which some have predicted will lead to Belarus’s loss of sovereignty. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the two countries would look for other ways to integrate their militaries. That decision came as Russia is bracing itself for a potential Ukrainian counterattack that could put Moscow on the defensive in its 15-month-old war. The head of the Wagner group said his Russian paramilitary organisation had begun to withdraw from the city of Bakhmut and would hand all its positions over to the regular Russian army by 1 June. Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Vladimir Putin, made the announcement during a visit to the ruined city, telling tank crews and other commanders that they would receive new orders soon and should withdraw to the rear. “We’ll hand over our positions, ammunition, everything including dry rations, to the troops,” meaning the Russian army, he said. Then, relishing another chance to ridicule the military, he said he would leave them two of his fighters in case things get “too hard”. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said on Thursday that Russia had begun to replace Wagner units with regular troops on the outskirts of Bakhmut, but that Wagner fighters remained inside the city. Russia recently claimed to have finally captured the city after nearly 250 days of fighting – a statement Kyiv disputes. Most analysts expect Ukraine to launch a counterattack, potentially threatening the Russian military’s hard-fought gains in Bakhmut and other areas of the front. Prigozhin has grown extremely critical of the Russian military, accusing Shoigu and other senior military officials of depriving his troops of shells and other ammunition. He said Wagner lost more than 20,000 men in the battle for Bakhmut. The mercenary group includes thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons. A Ukrainian official on Thursday suggested the counteroffensive would not mark a significant change shift of gear. “This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon,” wrote the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. Russian militias aligned with Ukraine also launched a cross-border raid earlier this week, setting up chaotic battles in the Belgorod region in some of the first sustained fighting on Russian territory since the beginning of the war. Ukraine has denied any connection to the fighters. A Ukrainian official on Thursday told Reuters that Kyiv had no connection to a “strange and pointless” drone attack against the Kremlin earlier this month. Video showed several unmanned aerial vehicles flying over the Kremlin walls before exploding in a flash of flight, causing damage to a building facade. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed the attack was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units.

Yevgeny Prigozhin made the comment in a recorded message posted on his Telegram channel on Sunday morning. Six members of Ukraine’s State Emergency Service have been killed by shelling in the southern region of Kherson, officials have said. According to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the Russian military dropped the shells from a drone near a populated area on Saturday. Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on the nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with life in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. The Russian nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Air raid alerts sounded for several hours overnight into early Sunday over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine. Officials said air defence systems shot down a number of drones, including one over Kyiv’s airspace. Five people were injured in a strike on the city of Balaklia, local authorities said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Russia has claimed that its defence systems shot down 22 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea overnight on Saturday. Writing on Telegram, the ministry of defence said that “during the night, 22 Ukrainian strike unmanned aerial vehicles were detected over the Black Sea by means of air defence.” Ukraine launched more than 10 drones on the Crimean peninsula overnight, including three on the port of Sevastopol, a Russian-installed official said early on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the situation in the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was becoming “increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous”. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman was killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. A gas pipeline and power lines in the Russian border region of Belgorod were damaged in overnight shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, according to the local governor.

Dutton told the Minerals Council on Wednesday that Australia needs a “frank debate” about nuclear energy, suggesting that it has a “wonderful opportunity to add value” to its uranium resources. The comments sparked a demand from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time for the Liberals to nominate “where the plants are going to be”. On Wednesday Dutton confirmed that he appointed Ted O’Brien as shadow energy minister in part because a committee inquiry he chaired in 2019 recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The Coalition is still reviewing its energy policy to develop an emissions reduction target before the next election and study nuclear energy to develop a “proper base of information”, according to comments Dutton made in the party room in August. On Wednesday the Liberal leader said “the imperative on all of us to create affordable and reliable and, where possible, emissions-reduced energy necessitates that we at least have a conversation about nuclear”. “[About] how that technology can play into the energy mix in the future? I think especially since Australia is home to one third of the world’s deposits of uranium. We have a wonderful opportunity to add value to that resource.” Dutton noted that former Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke “was strongly in favour of nuclear energy and couldn’t get it through the left of his party”. “John Howard to this day is very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as an option ... that crazy rightwinger in Canada, Justin Trudeau, is embracing small modular reactors.” Dutton posed the question: “If you don’t like coal and you don’t like gas, unless you believe clean hydrogen is about to be a reality, then what else firms up renewables? And I don’t know the answer to that question beyond nuclear.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton suggested nuclear energy could also help Australia “power up irrigation and open up thousands of square kilometres of export opportunities” before concluding the government should “at least allow” the community to have a debate about it. In August the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said “it is by far the most expensive form of energy”. “I mean, this is economic illiteracy from an opposition searching for relevance,” he told ABC News Breakfast. “[Nuclear] is slow to deploy. It couldn’t be deployed in Australia until 2030. “The CSIRO has made it very, very clear renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Nuclear is the most expensive. Why with rising energy prices you would put in the most expensive form of energy available is beyond me.” Later on Wednesday, the Liberals pursued Albanese in question time over his pre-election claims that Labor’s energy policy, including more renewables and upgrading the grid, could help save households $275 on their power bill. Albanese replied that the government stands by the modelling supporting the claim, and that Labor’s policy was based on the systems plan of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which identified it would “promote investment in renewables which is the cheapest form of energy”. Albanese said after “22 failed plans” the Coalition now wants “to go towards nuclear energy”. “And they can say, if you like, where the plants are going to be. I’ll look forward to their review, letting us know … [because] we know they have to be near urban areas and water.” While Labor raised the spectre of campaigning on the location of putative nuclear power plants, Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous voice to parliament “sight unseen”. “We have no idea what it means for the mining sector,” Dutton told the Minerals Council earlier. “We don’t know whether a voice that doesn’t represent the elders that you negotiate with or that your agreement is with in a particular location, now, they might be usurped and [the voice will] exercise a veto, right? That would damage your employees, that would damage your business.” Earlier, Dutton said it was an “inconvenient truth” for climate activists that “decarbonisation will require more mining”, due to critical minerals’ importance in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles. “I take some delight knowing it must keep them up at night.” Dutton said the Liberals don’t support “locking in” the 43% emissions reduction target in legislation because the “inflexible position” might disadvantage Australia if competitors did not meet their targets and it would make it “harder if not impossible” for government agencies to fund resources projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T20:43:02Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: cooling pond at Zaporizhzhia plant at risk after dam collapse – report ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","fields":{"bodyText":"The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant’s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse of the dyke around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst-case scenario and that there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but they warned of the dangers of sabotage by Russian forces who are occupying the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro River and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds that are used to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel at the site and the much bigger cooling pool used as a water reserve. “We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 [metres], after which there will not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station,” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine’s hydro power corporation, said on Thursday. In the wake of the dam disaster, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that “it is vital that this cooling pond remains intact”. “Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity,” he said. He later added that water from the Kakhovka reservoir was still being pumped to the power plant to cool reactors and other areas, though levels are at values earlier thought to make it impossible. The plant can also rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months’ worth of water, Grossi said. The IRSN report suggests that the integrity of the dyke around the pond could be in danger of collapse even without Russian sabotage. “A drop in the Dnipro’s water level could lead to basin leakage, or even to the collapse of the surrounding dyke, due to the pressure exerted by the water contained in the basin,” it said. It added that Energoatom had conducted stress tests after the Fukushima nuclear disaster following a tsunami in 2011. Those tests, it said, estimated that the dike can “withstand a Dnipro level of 10 metres in the vicinity of the power plant”. “This water level and the watertightness of the retention basin will be closely monitored over the coming days,” the report said. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou told the Guardian. Asked about the IRSN report, an Energoatom official said: “If the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir drops to less than 10 metres, the dam on the cooling pond may collapse, but not completely. Only the upper part may collapse. “But even then, the amount of water that will remain will be enough to keep the plant in a cold mode.” The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said on Thursday that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough “to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation”, but warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. “The very fact that the Russians blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station demonstrates that the Russians have no qualms about creating man-made disasters on earth,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukrainian television. “They can do the same on the territory of Zaporizhzhya NPP [nuclear power plant]. The consequences will be very bad.” “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. “We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant’s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.” Edwin Lyman, a physicist and director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “Anything that challenges the integrity of the cooling pond would cause complications and require alternate means of getting water to the spray ponds, as the paper points out. “My main concern at the moment is the increasing fragility of the site and the uncertainty regarding the ability of the reduced and stressed personnel to cope with a long-term emergency situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"Time for the government to tell the truth about nuclear power | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK is sadly becoming habituated to an officially sponsored attrition of truth about nuclear power. Despite intensifying propaganda, even government data shows this military-backed technology to be, in reality, an expensive, slow, unreliable, risky and unpopular way to deliver affordable, secure, zero-carbon energy. The gap in efficacy and competitiveness between nuclear and other options is continually growing. Supporting nuclear, rather than energy efficiency, wind and solar, slows down climate action, bleeds taxpayers, forgoes jobs and forces unnecessarily large and regressive burdens on consumers. Yet firehosing scarce public resources at ailing nuclear initiatives proceeds unabated. The nuclear fuel fund announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Tuesday is yet another among uncounted nozzles pointed variously at research, liability, insurance, training, finance, regulation, planning, non-proliferation, security, waste management, grid codes, etc. One notable feature of this most recent example of a worsening syndrome is that in the opening lines introducing this initiative, the BEIS says: “Nuclear is the only form of reliable, low-carbon generation which has been deployed at scale to date.” Whatever side is taken amid the complexities, the manifest falsity of this starkly unqualified statement is extraordinary. As the government’s own data also shows, the costs of managing variable supply are rapidly diminishing and are already far smaller than the competitiveness gap between nuclear and renewables. Current renewable contributions to UK electricity far surpass the peak achieved by nuclear. When did it become acceptable in British public life that a supposedly democratic government should so seriously misrepresent reality in a formal policy document? In a period when stakes are unprecedentedly high for climate, economy, energy security and hard-pressed households, it is time to renew reasoned scientific and democratic debate in this field and prevent this national self-harm by unaccountable special interests.

The decision by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, which had been repeatedly delayed, was finally announced on Wednesday and went against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate. French energy company EDF wants to build the 3.2 GW, two-reactor plant next to its existing site at Sizewell B, which began operating in 1995. However, the proposals have faced fierce opposition from local campaigners, who have argued against the project because of the environmental impact and the cost to energy billpayers. Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision. Planning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes. The approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents. The Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plant’s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. However, it is understood the UK government is keen to ease CGN out amid concerns over Chinese involvement with sensitive assets. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. Boris Johnson’s government put £100m of funding behind the project in January to support its development. Carly Vince, the project’s chief planning officer, said: “Sizewell C will be good for the region, creating thousands of opportunities for local people and businesses. It will boost local biodiversity and leave a legacy Suffolk can be proud of.” Julia Pyke, the director of financing for Sizewell C, said: “Energy costs will be lower with nuclear in the mix, so today’s decision is good news for billpayers. The tried and tested funding arrangement we are proposing means that, by paying a small amount during construction, consumers will benefit in the long-term. “Sizewell C will give a big boost to jobs and skills in nuclear supply chain companies across the country. It will strengthen the UK’s energy security and play a key role in our fight against climate change.” Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “The wrong decision has been made but it’s not the end of our campaign to Stop Sizewell C. Not only will we be looking closely at appealing this decision, we’ll continue to challenge every aspect of Sizewell C, because – whether it is the impact on consumers, the massive costs and delays, the outstanding technical questions or the environmental impacts – it remains a very bad risk.” Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “The construction of the proposed development will be damaging and it has been granted with insufficient consideration for the effects on nature as described by the government’s own experts. This is a ludicrous decision for an interim government to make.” Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, called the project a “red herring energy solution” as the UK attempts to move towards a low-carbon energy system. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the decision “significantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear capacity in Britain”. Hinkley Point C in Somerset, also backed by EDF, has been beset by delays and cost over-runs. The French government said on Tuesday it was prepared to pay €10bn (£8.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF amid concerns over its finances. Ministers in France want to keep a handle on soaring energy bills. Johnson has set a target of making investment decisions on eight new nuclear projects by the end of the decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-01T08:00:27Z","webTitle":"The Days review – this nuclear disaster drama is no Chernobyl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","fields":{"bodyText":"It feels borderline immoral to criticise The Days, a serenely measured and thorough dramatisation of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and its aftermath. The resourcefulness and courage of the men on duty at the power station at the hideous moment when calamity struck, who stayed for a week afterwards working to avoid a much worse catastrophe, deserves our deep respect. But as a drama, The Days is too respectful: its desire not to leave anything out might result in tired viewers abandoning their posts. One of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history took place under the sea off Japan’s east coast on 11 March 2011, rupturing the mains electricity supply to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. When a subsequent tsunami flooded the station – situated only 10 metres above sea level – it nullified the site’s emergency diesel generators. Now completely without power, the plant’s reactors could no longer be cooled – only an improvised damage limitation exercise would avoid a total meltdown. Fukushima was the worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl, and The Days is the first true-life dramatisation of a nuclear accident since Chernobyl, the deservedly acclaimed miniseries aired by Sky/HBO in 2019. That show was a stunning re-creation of specific events with a thick layer of more universal drama on top, as it explored not just the culture of lying and cover-ups that riddled the failing Soviet Union, but the tendency of hierarchical institutions everywhere to stifle the morals and independent thinking of individuals working within them. The Days, unfortunately, only really has the “stunning re-creation of specific events” part. Yes, there are scenes where senior managers and politicians give bad instructions because they are afraid of political blowback, concerned with their public image or too wedded to normal protocol, but they are few in number and don’t offer any surprising insights. Instead, many lengthy sequences recall the moments in Chornobyl when men volunteered to complete essential tasks, knowing that doing so would expose them to potentially fatal levels of radiation. Once the tsunami has arrived – the awesome destructive power of the sea crashing incongruously through dry-land structures is superbly rendered, and prompts a haunting miniature disaster movie featuring men stuck in a rapidly filling basement – the plant manager, Yoshida (Koji Yakusho), has to perform a terrible plate-spinning feat. He has several reactors that require ventilation, the pumping in of water, or both. As quickly as he and his team conjure a clever scheme to avert an explosion here, the readings are hitting the red zone there. Yakusho is excellent as a man who morphs slowly from a happily pottering pen-pusher, triple-checking everything with calm dedication, to a stubbly firebrand kicking over waste bins and disregarding direct orders because he can see what needs to be done, hasn’t slept for 80 hours and no longer has time for anyone’s bullshit. He is trapped in a steadily deteriorating nightmare, but the nature of it – more or less the same thing goes wrong, over and over and over, a little bit worse each time – kills The Days as a drama. Episode two centres on valves that need opening by hand, deep in the innards of a pitch-dark, increasingly irradiated building littered with debris and mud. “Please, select the staff members who will go inside,” says Yoshida to the control room supervisor, both of them tacitly aware that what he means is, decide which of your men might die. The scene where this choice is made is starkly moving, but that impact lessens as we see variations on the same scenario: something very similar takes place in episode seven, and in virtually every instalment in between. After a while it’s hard to keep track of which characters are stoically, heroically donning hazmat suits and stepping into the darkness – some of them ought to have been ruthlessly edited out. The Days also becomes a drama by numbers: much turns on this gauge not going above 600 kilopascals, that device requiring 125 volts, these dosimeters reading 85 and 97 millisieverts when a minute ago they were below 20 and so on, rather than a well-drawn human making the decision that defines them. The script is too busy ensuring it dutifully notes all the relevant facts to create any memorable characters outside Yoshida himself – evidently the show is meant as a tribute to the man, who died of cancer two years after the disaster, and on that level it admirably succeeds. It also has the feel of paying homage to the prime minister, Naoto Kan (Fumiyo Kohinata), whom we see in the grip of table-slapping frustration at waffly answers from nervous underlings. It’s an emotion that could be directed at The Days itself: when something is this important, ditch the fine details and get to the point. The Days is on Netflix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T10:14:30Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian dam collapse ‘no immediate risk’ to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-ukraine-dam-collapse-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-iaea","fields":{"bodyText":"The collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and the draining of the reservoir behind it does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant further upstream, but will have long-term implications for its future, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement on the Telegram social media platform saying the situation at the plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, was “under control”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said in a statement: “our current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.” But there are long-term concerns, both over safety and the possibility of the plant becoming operational again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C so it would be easier to restart if conditions allowed, and to supply winter heating to the neighbouring town of Energodar. Oleksiy, who left after Russian forces occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should be shut down and that the plant had sufficient resources to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was at 16.6 metres (54.5ft), “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] where water can be maintained above the reservoir level, and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is a senior research associate on the project on managing the atom at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down-staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. In his statement, Grossi said that the cooling pond should last “for some months” but it was imperative it was not damaged in fighting. The water is used to cool not just the reactor cores, but also the spent fuel and the diesel generators used for safety systems. “Absence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,” he warned. Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T09:38:50Z","webTitle":"Australia will have ‘unequivocal’ control over nuclear-powered submarines, insists chief adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce insists Australia will retain full operational control over the submarines, while potentially having US or British engineers on board to provide technical advice. The comments follow renewed debate in recent weeks over whether the flagship project of the Aukus pact – which relies on support from the US and the UK – will lead to an erosion of Australian sovereignty. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether the submarines could be “operated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navy”, and whether that effectively meant “sovereignty would be shared with the US”. But the head of the taskforce advising the Australian government on the acquisition of at least eight submarines, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, used an interview with ABC TV on Monday evening to assert Australian control. “When we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capability,” he told the 7.30 program. “We will be commanding and controlling, under the Australian government direction, that nuclear-powered submarine.” Mead allowed for the possibility Australia would need advice from foreign engineers – but said that would not limit Australian command and control. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Yes, we may have US or UK seariders on board to assist,” he told the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. “We would expect anyone, whether it be a foreign engineer or an Australian engineer, to provide advice. Ultimately the commanding officer of that submarine – the Australian – would have command and control over the reactor, over the submarine, unequivocal.” Mead continued to argue that the nuclear reactors powering the submarines – to be supplied from overseas – would be “welded shut” and would not need refuelling during the life of the boat, so Australia would not need to manufacture nuclear fuel. But Mead said the plan would require Australia to send personnel to US “design facilities”. That would enable Australia to understand “every element of detail of that reactor”, he said. Mead did not rule out the possibility that Australia might build its own nuclear reactors in the future, although that would be a decision for government. “We are not envisioning that at the moment, we haven’t gone into that at the moment,” he said. Like the defence minister, Richard Marles, Mead expressed confidence that the plan to be announced soon would ensure there was no capability gap between the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class diesel-electric submarines and the entry into service of nuclear-powered boats. But he did not provide specifics. Mead also described the purpose of nuclear-powered submarines as being to “put the greatest question of doubt in the enemy’s mind” and “if necessary, respond with massive firepower”. Marles used a speech to parliament last week to declare that acquiring nuclear-powered submarines would “dramatically enhance” Australia’s sovereignty, rather than undermine it. Marles, who is also the deputy prime minister, said “the reality is that almost all of Australia’s high-end capability is developed in cooperation with our partners”. Marles said Australia would “always make sovereign, independent decisions on how our capabilities are employed”. In the wake of that speech, Turnbull tweeted that it was “quite a different thing to have a major platform that cannot be operated without the supervision/support of another country”. Turnbull said on Monday evening: “I think the question which has not been answered is: could the submarines be operated if US technical advice/support were withdrawn? The entire resources of the Australian news media have been unable to pin the government or the navy down on that.” Paul Keating, the former Labor prime minister has previously raised concerns about increased reliance on US support and suggested Australia’s sovereignty was being “wilfully suborned”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-18T14:55:32Z","webTitle":"Energy fears weaken German taboos over nuclear power and speed limits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s energy crisis has led the coalition government to toy with ideas that have long been seen as politically taboo, such as extending the life of unpopular nuclear power plants and – perhaps even more divisive – imposing a speed limit on the autobahn in the hope it will reduce fuel usage. As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation. Central to the debate is also how Germany hopes to maintain its climate goals, particularly after a recent decision – backed by the Green economics minister – to reignite highly polluting coal-fired power plants for a limited time. The proposal gaining ever more traction and making its mark in newspaper editorials and late-night television debates is for the country’s remaining three nuclear power plants, which are due to close at the end of the year, to be kept running, a move staunchly opposed by the Green party since it came into existence in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the FDP has not publicly signalled that it is ready to give up its enduring opposition to a speed limit on the autobahns, but the opposition Christian Democrats, under pressure from their close allies, have hinted they may be prepared to consider backing a temporary limit. Germany’s last three remaining nuclear power stations generate enough electricity to heat about 7m homes, or to cover just under 6% of the country’s electricity needs. Talk of keeping them open remains speculative, but comments from both sides of the debate suggest they might move towards a compromise. The Greens’ co-leader, Ricarda Lang, said on Sunday that it was not the right time to think of prolonging the life of the plants, but she said that owing to the energy crisis and the impact it was having on lower-income families, her party had to be ready to consider all options. “At every moment in this crisis we need to react according to the current situation and to examine every measure. That’s what we’ve done in the past … and that’s what we’ll continue to do,” she said on German television. She said the Greens’ main concern was the impact of higher energy bills. “We have to prevent a wave of poverty,” she said. In response, Jens Spahn, a parliamentary deputy of the Christian Democrats, which along with the FDP has long opposed a speed limit, said: “If the Greens said they would let nuclear power run for another half a year, then I believe we should also be ready to talk about the speed limit.” He told Germany’s breakfast TV programme Morgenmagazin that at a time of national emergency, “everyone has to be prepared to jump over their own shadows”. Experts have said the flippant way in which the two issues are being discussed does not reflect the complexities behind them. The two issues are said to be to Germans the equivalent of what gun ownership is to Americans. The phase-out of nuclear power plants in Germany was triggered by the Fukishima accident in Japan in 2011, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to renewed debate. A government report concluded that prolonging their use was not advisable as it would “only make a small contribution to energy security” and would “increase costs elsewhere”. It said the challenge of refuelling them would mean they would not deliver electricity until autumn 2023, and they would have to run between three and five years longer in order to make investments in staff and infrastructure pay off. It also said security measures to protect the plants, including from air attack, meant it was not feasible to consider them as a short-term solution. And all that is before any likely legal challenges are taken into account. Introducing a speed limit on the parts of the motorway that have none would be easier, in theory. Advocates say it would increase safety and reduce emissions. A 130 km/h (80 mph) limit could decrease CO2 emissions by 1.9m tonnes a year, according to the German environment agency. Opponents argue it would not make the roads safer – most deaths occur on country roads, not motorways – and insist the freedom to speed has to be clung to as it is one of the few areas of German life which remain relatively unregulated. FDP voters are among the strongest supporters of no speed limit and keeping nuclear power, while Green voters are almost equally in favour of a speed limit and ditching nuclear power. And just as the Greens argue that a speed limit would reduce emissions, FDP members are liable to argue that keeping open the three nuclear plants would save about 30m tonnes of CO2 annually. ADAC, which represents about 21 million German drivers, has said about 50% of its members are in favour of the introduction of a limit and 45% are against."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-20T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power stations’ decommissioning cost soars to £23.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","fields":{"bodyText":"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s seven ageing nuclear power stations has nearly doubled to £23.5bn and is likely to rise further, the public accounts committee has said. The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunterston B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, their report said. Failures in the government’s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional £10.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UK’s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade. The government has recently agreed that once the stations have been defuelled by EDF, which involves the removal of all the spent fuel from the reactor core and cooling ponds, ownership of the stations will be transferred to the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to complete decommissioning. “The pace at which the stations can be defuelled could have a big impact on the costs, between £3.1bn and £8bn depending on the time taken,” the inquiry report said. “Successful defuelling will depend on all parties being ready and working together, including the NDA being ready to receive and dismantle the volume of fuel arriving at Sellafield. Any delays in the defuelling process could result in costs increasing substantially. “The handover agreement does not appear to sufficiently ‘incentivise cost efficiency and ensure a smooth transfer of defuelled stations to the NDA’.” The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer £132bn to decommission all the UK’s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UK’s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from £12.6bn in 2004-05 to £23.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. “There remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,” the report said. “The cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.” There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors – which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations – had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online. • This article was amended on 20 May 2022 to refer correctly to Hunterston B power station, not “Hunstanton B”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T18:06:22Z","webTitle":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","fields":{"bodyText":"We are now closing this live blog. Here is a summary of today’s events: Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region – one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, a study finds. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said. The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to around 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the UK’s ministry of defence said. Russia was one of a small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s state funeral in London today that included Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, has criticised Russia after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Reuters reports that in a video posted on social media, he told Luhansk People’s Republic leader Leonid Pasechnik in a phone call that “our actions should be synchronised”. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Lambrecht said the 10 howitzers already supplied by Germany and eight from the Netherlands “have proven themselves in battle.” She said: Ukraine is full of praise of the system and has expressed a desire for more howitzers. In order to further support Ukraine in its brave fight against the brutal Russian attack, Germany will grant this request.” Lambrecht said the Panzerhaubitze 2000 model howitzers recently underwent refurbishment. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said, adding: “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraine’s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his “special military operation” in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv. Over the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river’s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. On Monday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. You can read the full report here. More on the mass grave in Izium. Reuters reports that Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said around 450 bodies are believed to have been buried at the site in a forest on the outskirts of Izium, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region. A hearing in Moscow to decide on the future of the Jewish Agency’s activities in Russia has been postponed for four weeks after lawyers for the charity, which facilitates immigration of Jewish people to Israel, asked for time to submit amendments to the agency’s scope of operations. Russia’s justice ministry first recommended in June that the Jewish Agency - a quasi-governmental body - be shut down for violating Russian privacy laws. A hearing in August was delayed by the Basmanny city court to 19 September, and delayed again today for another four weeks. Israel has been caught in a delicate balancing act since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February: the country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next-door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and forceful diplomatic action. Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agency’s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations. About 24,000 Russians have arrived in Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency. Around 165,000 people with Jewish heritage were estimated to live in Russia at the beginning of 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and how expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Russia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the world’s wheat supply. Researchers in the United States and Uruguay modelled the likely impact of the conflict on wheat and maize prices over the coming 12 months, looking at a variety of scenarios for the study published in Nature Food. One model found that if Russian grain exports were halved and Ukrainian exports significantly reduced during that time, maize would be 4.6% more expensive and wheat 7.2% more expensive - even assuming that other exporters could step in and plug the gap. The researchers said the price increase would persist as long as exports remained restricted, Agence France-Press reports. To close the supply shortfall, the study found that other major producers would need to expand their grain-growing areas significantly. Were all grain exports from Ukraine to cease, Australia would need to expand its wheat area by 1%, China by 1.5%, the European Union by 1.9% and India by 1.2%, according to the model. This land-use change would lead to just over a billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent added to the atmosphere, the study said. Lead author Jerome Dumortier, a researcher at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Indianapolis in the US, said: The cropland expansion resulting from the war in Ukraine is occurring at the expense of more carbon emissions,” said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned in July that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had combined with the lingering trade impacts of Covid-19 to create an “unprecedented global hunger crisis”. Figures from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization show food prices are currently more than 10% higher than they were a year ago. Although Moscow and Kyiv reached an agreement in July to resume some grain exports, there are fears that the conflict could lead to years of elevated food prices. Dumortier said that it was not currently clear whether other grain producers were able to meet global demand, meaning prices could rise even further than predicted in the models. “There are drought conditions in South America, Europe, and China, and export restrictions from various countries,” he told AFP. “Given those hindrances to full adjustment, commodity prices may be higher than what is estimated in the paper.” Ukraine’s first lady said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Olena Zelenska, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, was among hundreds of heads of state and dignitaries from around the world gathered in Westminster Abbey for the service on Monday. She represented her nation at the ceremony on behalf of her husband, as he continues to organise the fightback against Russian invaders, PA News reports. Zelenska said the Queen’s attention to Ukraine “was an important signal of support”. She wrote on Twitter: She wished us better times and shared our desire for freedom. We will always remember it with deep gratitude.” On Sunday, Zelenska visited Westminster Hall for the Queen’s lying in state to pay her respects to the Queen. She was pictured bowing her head as she stood alongside Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal and Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko. Earlier she met the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. Zelenska travelled to the UK after her husband last week signed a book of condolence for the Queen. The UK’s ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, said she was “deeply honoured” by the president’s gesture. She added: Grateful to the president for taking the time to do this given all else that is happening in (Ukraine) at this time.” Ukrainian troops have been taking part in a major counter-offensive against Russia’s forces. Zelenskiy appeared to be a fan of the Queen, having been given a biography of the Queen by Boris Johnson during the then-prime minister’s visit to Kyiv in June. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said on Monday. Reuters reports that the ministry said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail on to the grounds of the Russian embassy in Ottawa. The ministry also said “aggressive” demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. Here is a summary of events so far: The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s funeral in London today including Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. A selection of recent pictures from the agencies My colleagues Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report on the Ukrainian recapture of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region, with liberated Ukrainians telling of life under occupation. Until last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayor’s office in the town of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region. There was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin “leader”, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkove’s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian. Strezhko’s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraine’s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators. Shevchenkove’s acting military administrator, Andrii Konashavych, pointed to the chair where the pseudo-mayor had sat in the council building. On the wall was a portrait of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine’s national poet who gives his name to the town. What happened to the Putin photo? “We tore it up,” Konashavych said. Why was there no picture of President Zelenskiy? “Presidents come and go. Shevchenko is eternal,” he replied. Read the full report here. The Kremlin said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian president Vladimir Putin, described the “strengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russia’s foreign policy.” During a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of China’s Communist party, Patrushev said: In the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.” After the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping, Patrushev’s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to: …expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.” The Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized a need to expand cooperation on cybersecurity and bolster contacts between their law enforcement agencies on fighting terrorism. The statement didn’t offer any further details of prospective cooperation. Putin met with Chinese president Xi Jinping last week in Uzbekistan, their first encounter since the Russian leader invaded Ukraine in February. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting said Xi promised “strong support” for Russia’s “core interests.” Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships. Party insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”. Read the full report here. The Associated Press has a preview of this week’s meeting of the UN general assembly: Facing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europe’s first major war since World War II — a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War. The many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fuelled tide of misinformation and hate speech — all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year. For the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighbouring Russia. Its invasion not only threatens Ukraine‘s survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said the strategic divides — with the west on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other — are “paralysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face”. He pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but to the war’s impact on the global economy. Escalating food and energy prices are hitting the world’s poorest people hardest, and nations are “being devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest” instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the UN charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. Scholz, whose two-day trip will also take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will become the latest Western leader to meet with the crown prince. Bin Salman has been regarded as a pariah in the West due to his suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But he is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels after Russia cut gas supplies amid soaring tensions over its invasion of Ukraine. Agence France-Press reports: Scholz, accompanied by a business delegation, will visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he will meet with the crown prince and - if his health permits it - King Salman, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He did not go into detail about the reasons for Scholz’s Gulf visit but said he would be “very surprised” if the topic of energy was not discussed. The spokesman also offered assurances that “the murder of Mr Khashoggi will certainly figure in discussions”. It is the latest sign of bin Salman’s international rehabilitation - in July, French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with him in Paris, and US President Joe Biden visited the kingdom. On Sunday, Scholz will head to the UAE and meet with President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and in the afternoon will hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. German economy minister Robert Habeck already visited Qatar and the UAE in March in an effort to find alternatives to Russian gas, which Germany has traditionally depended on heavily. Russia’s decision to cut off supplies has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, with consumers and businesses facing soaring bills as winter approaches. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have sentenced an employee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - the world’s largest regional security organisation - to 13 years in jail on treason charges, Russian news agencies reported Monday. “A panel of judges found Dmitry Pavlovich Shabanov guilty … and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LNR). Shabanov, who was detained in April, is accused of passing confidential information to foreign intelligence services, Agence France-Presse reports. According to separatist authorities, Shabanov was recruited in 2016 by a former officer of Ukraine’s SBU security service and an agent in Ukraine of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Between August 2021 and April 2022, he collected “information on the movements of military equipment as well as units of the Lugansk People’s Army” and “sent them to the CIA agent”, the separatists said. The OSCE has “unequivocally” condemned the charges against Shabanov and Mikhail Petrov, another OSCE staffer detailed in April, describing the allegations as “totally unacceptable so-called ‘legal proceedings’”. The OSCE mission, which has been deployed in the conflict zone since 2014, left the separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk in the wake of Russia’s offensive in Ukraine earlier this year. Here is what we know so far regarding the more than 440 graves that have been uncovered in a forest near Izium in eastern Ukraine. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), some of the bodies recovered had their hands tied. Others showed signs of having suffered violence. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the discovery of a mass grave in Izium after it was recaptured from the Russians. At one burial site, more than 440 graves dating between March and September 2022 were discovered. Investigators have exhumed the bodies of at least 17 Ukrainian soldiers from one site. A cross over the grave bore the inscription: “Ukrainian army, 17 people. Izium morgue.” The authorities say there are more than 440 tombs because the last number entered on the crosses is 445. Some of the crosses are made from varnished wood and also carry names and dates. Investigators say about 100 bodies have been exhumed. Ukrainian officials suspect that some of the dead were tortured by Russian forces during their occupation of the north-east Kharkiv region. At least two of the bodies recovered were found with their hands tied, AFP journalists said. One of the two “had their hands tied, their jaw broken and two stab wounds in the back”, a member of the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office told AFP on condition of anonymity. The remains have been identified as that of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer fighter, the official added. Civilians who died during fighting in March for control of the city have also been exhumed. Around 10 teams – each of around four people, including representatives of the prosecutor’s office – have been at work investigating following the discovery of the graves. Emergency service workers in white overalls were handling the exhumations. Kharkiv prosecutor Yevgen Sokolov, who is leading the investigation, said he did not have an exact number for those thought to have suffered violent deaths. Of the bodies so far exhumed, he said “most have wounds from shelling and explosions”. Others had suffered “injuries from sharp objects and showed signs of violent death”, he said. Sokolov said one combatant had had “his hands tied behind his back” and another was found with “rope around the neck and broken limbs”. He also said a body was exhumed “with multiple stab wounds”. “At this point, we don’t have bodies with bullets in their skulls but there is still a lot of work to be done,” he said. If the weather remained mild, he estimated it would take another week to finish exhuming the bodies. Europe’s imports of thermal coal in 2022 could be the highest in at least four years and may rise further next year, analysts said on Monday, highlighting the extent of the energy crisis following sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. European imports of thermal coal this year could rise to about 100m tonnes, the most since 2017, according to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, while commodities pricing agency Argus expects shipments to reach a four-year high. “Europe is going back in time,” Rodrigo Echeverri, head of research at Noble, told a conference. European governments have outlined new measures on how they will cope with potential energy shortages this winter, with Russian gas flows still running at severely reduced rates amid the Ukraine war. Reuters reports that Spain has drawn up plans that could force energy-intensive industries to shut at peak demand times. France said it was preparing to send gas to Germany from October, while Berlin said Europe’s powerhouse was still in talks on state aid for ailing utility Uniper. Russia, which had supplied about 40% of the European Union’s gas before its February invasion of Ukraine, has said it closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – once one of Europe’s major gas supply routes – because western sanctions hindered operations. European gas prices have more than doubled from the start of the year amid a decline in Russian supplies. The sharp drop in Russian fuel exports has left governments scrambling to find energy resources, but also to warn that power cuts could happen, amid fears of recession. In France, exports of natural gas to Germany could start around 10 October, the head of France’s CRE energy regulator said, following an announcement by president Emmanuel Macron that the two EU neighbours would help each other with electricity and gas flows amid the crisis. CRE chief Emmanuelle Wargon told FranceInfo radio: Gas was (until now) only flowing from Germany to France, so we did not have the technical tools to reverse the flows and we did not even have a method to regulate prices.” Wargon added that “exceptional” measures this winter could include localised electricity cuts if the winter is cold and EDF’s plans to repair corrosion-hit nuclear reactors are delayed. “But there will be no gas cuts for households. Never,” she said. Spanish industry minister Reyes Maroto said that obliging energy-intensive companies to close down during consumption peaks is an option on the table this winter if required. The companies would be compensated financially, she said adding there is no need to impose such closures now. And Finns were warned they should be prepared for power outages. National grid operator Fingrid said: As a result of great uncertainties, Finns should be prepared for power outages caused by a possible power shortage in the coming winter.” Finnish power retailer Karhu Voima Oy said it had filed for bankruptcy due to a sharp rise in electricity price rises. German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Monday that he was still looking at ways to ensure gas prices remained affordable for people while awaiting recommendations from a group of experts. When asked about a possible cap on gas prices Lindner said: We have developed this commission, but proposals within the federal government are also being considered further, so it has not been completely outsourced.” The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank said: The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying.” It also warned of a “broad-based and prolonged decline in economic output”. The likely slump was above all down to “supply-side constraints”, namely reduced deliveries of energy in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. Moscow has drastically reduced it supplies of gas to Europe and kept the Nord Stream pipeline shut since the end of August, heaping pressure on Germany’s economy. Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy imports with 55% of its gas coming from Russia before the outbreak of the war. The economy would likely shrink “slightly” in the third quarter of the year, the Bundesbank said, before a “marked” drop over the last three months of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. The Russian gas supply stop meant that the situation regarding gas markets was “very tense”, it said. Germany could “avoid formal rationing” of the fuel, but necessary reductions in consumption would lead companies to limit or pause production, the central bank predicted. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on the Telegram messenger app, Donetsk’s separatist mayor Alexei Kulemzin said that 13 civilians including two children had been killed in the strike on Donetsk’s Kuybyshevsky district. He said that the number of wounded was being confirmed. Donetsk city has been controlled by the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic since 2014. The Ukrainian army continues to hold positions on Donetsk’s outskirts, and the city has come under artillery fire repeatedly in recent months. The Guardian is unable to verify battlefield reports. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. About 450 bodies, most of which Ukraine says are those of civilians, have been found in mass graves near Izium after Russian troops were this month forced out of the Kharkiv region, much of which they had controlled since the first weeks of their military campaign in Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said investigators at the site had found evidence of torture, including bodies with hands tied, and accused Russian troops of committing war crimes. Asked on Monday about Zelenskiy’s statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “It’s the same scenario as in Bucha. It’s a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story.” Russia previously rejected claims that its troops had committed war crimes in Bucha, outside Kyiv, after evidence of civilians being killed while the town was controlled by Russian troops came to light after Russia’s withdrawal at the end of March. (Via Reuters) Last week, Zelenskiy accused Russia of “leaving death everywhere” after the discovery of the Izium site. Men in white overalls began digging out bodies last Friday as part of a mass exhumation at the site, reporters with the Reuters news agency said, and 20 white bodybags could be seen. Reuters reported that several bodies had rope tied around their necks and hands. Ukraine’s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, has described the Russian missile strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant – see earlier post here – as an act of “nuclear terrorism”. (Via AP) Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian can reveal. The Football Union of Russia has written to the governing body accusing Oleksandr Petrakov of discriminating against Russians and failing to remain politically neutral. Denis Rogachev, the deputy secretary general of the FUR, cited comments carried in two newspapers – Italy’s Corriere dello Sport and Russia’s Sport Express – as evidence of Petrakov’s guilt. In a letter to Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body, Petrakov is accused of breaching codes of conduct by calling for Russians to be banned from international sport and talking about his hopes of joining the armed forces. Full story here. The US president, Joe Biden, used an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes programme on Sunday night to warn Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. When asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader was mulling such a move, he said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Biden praised the Ukrainians for their gritty fight against the Russian invasion and said: “They’re defeating Russia”. Asked how to define victory for Kyiv, he said: “Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely.” But given the scale of human suffering and destruction inflicted in resisting the Russian onslaught, “it’s awful hard to count that as winning”, he added. Reuters has more information on the Russian strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the early hours of Monday: Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. A blast took place 300 metres away from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings shortly after midnight, Energoatom said in a statement. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Energoatom said: Currently, all three power units of the PNPP (Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant) are operating normally. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff It published two photographs showing a crater it said was caused by the blast. In one of the pictures a man stood in the crater to give a sense of its size. Commenting on the strike on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine‘s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: The invaders wanted to shoot again, but they forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before it’s too late. There was no immediate Russian reaction to Ukraine’s accusations. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces in recent weeks. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia - which is Europe’s largest and lies about 250km (155 miles) east of the Mykolaiv site - was shut down earlier this month due to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend one of the four main power lines at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russian troops have struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Reuters reports. According to Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, a blast early on Monday took place 300 metres from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. There is a realistic possibility that the increase in losses was partially a result of the Russian air force accepting greater risk in a move to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances, the defence ministry said in its daily intelligence on Twitter. Russian pilots’ situational awareness is often poor, it said. “There is a realistic possibility that some aircraft have strayed over enemy territory and into denser air defence zones as the frontlines have moved rapidly.” (Via Reuters) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s funeral in London today, as AFP reports: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – under a travel ban to the UK due to sanctions – had already said he would not attend. But not inviting any Russian representative to the Queen’s funeral was “particularly blasphemous towards Elizabeth II’s memory” and “deeply immoral”, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow said on Thursday. Russia and Belarus have embassies in London and their presidents sent King Charles III messages of condolences. Other countries with no invitations are Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Good morning. This is Sam Jones taking over now from my colleague Virginia. Ukrainians flee shelling of Kupiansk as Russian forces try to slow advances On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. As Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report, cars packed with families streamed out of the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine recaptured just over a week ago as part of a stunning counter-offensive. Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, sits on either side of the river. It is on the new frontline after Ukrainian forces on Friday crossed to the right bank. They are now poised to push further into Luhansk province, which the Kremlin and its local proxies have controlled entirely since June, and partly since 2014. Here’s the full story. Russian pop star speaks out against war in Ukraine The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” Read more here. Milley: “Not going too well for Russia” The top US general on Sunday said it was still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine and called for vigilance among US troops as he visited a base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort, Reuters reported. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Some recent images from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Russian attacks in east and south repelled, says Ukraine military Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region, said this meant the “de-occupation” of his region was “not far away”. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. “Putin’s souring relationship with the military command and the Russian (MoD) may explain in part the Kremlin’s increasing focus on recruiting ill-prepared volunteers into ad-hoc irregular units rather than attempting to draw them into reserve or replacement pools for regular Russian combat units,” the ISW said. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Virginia Harrison and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s just after 8am in Kyiv and these are the main developments: The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. “Perhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly address on Sunday. “But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.” In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” it said on Sunday. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium”, adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice”, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T04:32:55Z","webTitle":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Japan is considering building next-generation nuclear reactors and restarting idled plants in a major policy shift, 11 years after the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant rocked the country’s dependence on atomic energy. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said he had directed a government panel to look into how “next-generation nuclear reactors equipped with new safety mechanisms” could be used to help Japan achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. His “green transformation” council is expected to report back by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday. The change of direction, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors, have highlighted Japan’s struggle to secure a stable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and soaring energy costs. Successive governments have been forced to lower Japan’s dependence on nuclear since the March 2011 disaster, when a powerful tsunami destroyed Fukushima Daiichi’s backup electricity supply, causing three of its six reactors to suffer meltdowns. Most of Japan’s nuclear plants have remained idle ever since, while the government said it would not build new reactors or replace ageing reactors, fearing a public backlash. If realised, Kishida’s plans would mark a dramatic reversal of that stance. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has vastly transformed the world’s energy landscape … Japan needs to bear in mind potential crisis scenarios,” he said at an energy policy meeting this week. “To overcome an imminent crisis caused of a power supply crunch, we must take the utmost steps to mobilise all possible policies in the coming years and prepare for any emergency.” The economy and industry minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said it was “extremely important to secure all options to redesign a stable energy supply for our country. From that perspective, we will also consider all options regarding nuclear power.” Kishida conceded that the government would have to win support from the public, which turned against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Officials believe voters have become more receptive to nuclear power due to rising fuel costs and after an energy crunch in Tokyo during a recent heatwave. The country is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. “It is the first step towards the normalisation of Japan’s energy policy,” said Jun Arima, a project professor at the Tokyo University’s graduate school of public policy. Seven reactors are currently in operation, with three others offline for regular safety inspections. Dozens of others are still going through a relicensing process under stricter safety standards introduced after the 2011 disaster, which some experts blamed on the “nuclear village” of operators, politicians and regulators. A bigger role for nuclear in Japan’s energy mix could see seven additional reactors being restarted after next summer, including two at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, the biggest nuclear plant in the world. Restarting the plant would be particularly controversial, since it is run by Tokyo Electric Power, the same company that operates Fukushima Daiichi. The 2011 disaster sent huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Some areas near the plant remain off-limits, while others have only recently reopened to residents. The government will also consider extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the legal limit by excluding the period they remained shut down – in some cases several years – when calculating their operating time. Plants can operate for up to 40 years in principle, but can continue generating electricity for another 20 years if they undergo safety upgrades and pass screenings conducted by regulators. Japan has set a target for nuclear power generation to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030. Before the Fukushima meltdowns, about a third of its power generation came from nuclear, but in 2020 the figure was less than 5%.

Two separate legal challenges are being lodged on Tuesday at the European Union’s general court in Luxembourg – one by Greenpeace and another by a coalition including Client Earth and WWF – after the classification of fuels in the so-called taxonomy, a guide for investors intended to channel billions into green technologies. The EU executive, argues Greenpeace, acted unlawfully when it designated gas and nuclear as bridge technologies in the taxonomy, which is intended to help meet the bloc’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Client Earth, along with three other NGOs, is challenging the inclusion of gas, which it says breaks the EU climate law that sets a legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The cases are the latest legal action against the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”. Last year a lawsuit was launched by Austria and supported by Luxembourg. Eight national and regional Greenpeace organisations including France, Germany and EU office in Brussels are asking the court to rule the inclusion of gas and nuclear invalid. Nina Treu, the executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “The taxonomy was meant to be a tool to meet the 1.5C target [on global heating] and make the European Union climate neutral, fostering social and economic restructuring for the European economy by shifting funds. Instead of hindering greenwashing, it has become a tool for greenwashing.” Gas and nuclear had been included because of “politically motivated lobbying”, Treu said. Greenpeace will tell the court that gas cannot be considered a “transition fuel” because any gas-powered plant that comes online today will still be running beyond 2050. The environment group will also say the construction of new nuclear plants – which usually take one to two decades to build in Europe – will delay the move away from coal power, hinder development of renewables, risk accidents and create pollution. “Nuclear is dangerous, expensive, vulnerable to climate change and too slow to stop the climate breakdown,” Treu said. Greenpeace has hired the lawyer Roda Verheyen, who acted for the group in a landmark case that resulted in Germany’s climate protection laws being ruled inadequate by the country’s constitutional court in 2021. Verheyen said the inclusion of gas and nuclear was not in line with the EU’s original taxonomy law. “The European Commission has violated the very idea of the taxonomy regulation. This is especially obvious as including nuclear activities does pose significant harm to the environment, which is expressly prohibited by the regulation.” The lawsuit was “essentially an enforcement claim”, she said. “Observe your own law. Actually carry through with the European green deal,” she said, referring to the EU’s flagship climate plan. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The campaign groups are challenging one of the delegated acts. The separate legal challenge by the coalition including Client Earth and WWF covers the inclusion of gas but not nuclear. Anaïs Berthier at Client Earth said the European Commission had violated a requirement to make science-based policy and broken the EU climate law that required policymakers to carry out checks to ensure all actions by the bloc were consistent with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050. “Labelling fossil gas as ‘sustainable’ is as absurd as it is unlawful,” said the coalition, which also includes the NGOs Transport &amp; Environment and Bund. “It goes against the EU’s own scientific advice and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the EU’s climate action. Fossil gas is not clean, not cheap and not a secure source of energy.” A judgment is expected in 2025, although participants expressed the hope the court would act faster. “There is confusion in the market, because the current law infringes European law,” Verheyen said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-04T07:50:01Z","webTitle":"US hails progress in getting Australia nuclear-powered submarines ‘at the earliest possible date’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia and the US have made “significant progress” towards getting Australia a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines “at the earliest possible date”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Saturday. The federal government is set to announce its Aukus submarine plans by the end of March, amid mounting concerns that the US could struggle to provide them, and a push for President Joe Biden to fast-track research into submarines that use non-weapons grade uranium. Austin met the defence minister, Richard Marles, in Washington on Saturday (Australian time) to discuss the Aukus pact between Australia, the US and the UK, as well as regional security and other issues. They also talked about the upcoming public release of the defence strategic review during a bilateral meeting at the Pentagon. Austin said that, at a December meeting last year, he and Marles had agreed to deeper defence cooperation, to strengthening coordination on regional priorities, and to increasing climate change resilience. “We also pledged to find new ways to work closely with Japan, as we pursue a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, as a region where all countries can chart their own course and all states respect international rules and norms and where all disputes are resolved peacefully,” Austin said. “All of this is yet another reminder that our unbreakable alliance is capable of great things. It has, indeed, endured for generations, and it remains vital to regional peace and security.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Before the meeting, he said the discussion would help the nations “make further progress in our alliances and trilateral reach with Aukus”. “We’ve already made significant progress on developing the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability at the earliest possible date,” he said. Marles called it an “excellent meeting”. He also conceded building up the nuclear workforce was “one of the real challenges we face”, according to the Nine newspapers. Another challenge was America’s bureaucracy around exports, which could delay the transfer of technology. The US and UK would benefit from the Aukus deal as well as Australia, he said, calling it a “three-way ecosystem”. The meeting took place just before a second Chinese spy balloon was spotted. The Pentagon tracked the first as it flew over the US mainland, then confirmed a second one had been seen over Latin America. US officials made it clear they did not believe China’s claim it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, and there was immediate diplomatic fallout, with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, delaying an imminent trip to China. Marles said China had questions to answer over the intrusion. According to the Australian Financial Review, Marles said he did not know more about the balloon than what was already public, and that he was unaware of anything similar ever flying over Australia. “There are a lot of questions associated with it, which I think everyone has. We all want the answers to those questions from China,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T18:47:13Z","webTitle":"Russian strikes risked ‘nuclear catastrophe’, says Ukraine energy chief; Moscow says 50 PoWs freed – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","fields":{"bodyText":"Here are all the key developments in the Ukraine war from today: In a interview with the Financial Times, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) said. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expects the three nuclear power plants will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. I’m closing the blog now for the day but it will reopen again tomorrow morning. Thanks again for following. The Financial Times has an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure and plunge it into darkness would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a “war of strength and resilience”. Pushing back against western fears of escalation, Ukraine’s president insisted there would be no lasting resolution to the war unless Russia withdrew from all the territories it was occupying. Moscow has stepped up a bombing campaign against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure since last month, hoping to force Kyiv to make concessions despite its advances on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said: We must return all lands . . . because I believe that the battlefield is the way when there is no diplomacy. If you can’t get your land back entirely, the war is simply frozen. It’s a question of time before it resumes. On Wednesday, Russia launched 70 missiles against infrastructure targets across Ukraine, leaving about 80 per cent of the country in the dark and without water. All 15 of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors were taken offline because electricity became unstable. Speaking in the presidential office, which was also out of water supply, Zelenskyy said: It was the kind of incident that hasn’t happened for I don’t know how many years, maybe 80, 90 years: a country on the European continent where there was totally no light. The state superbly fought back. Energy workers, the state emergencies’ ministry, deminers, everyone worked to fix and restore power and provide at least a bit of water. This is a war about strength, about resilience, it is about who stands stronger. Zelenskyy also appealed to Ukraine’s western partners to provide more air defence equipment to help protect critical infrastructure, as well as diesel supplies for emergency generators and additional gas to help offset power shortages. The president said the attacks targeting civilian infrastructure showed Moscow had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. Kyiv has been pushing back at perceived pressure to show its openness to an eventual negotiated solution to the war. Some western partners are concerned that any attempt by Ukraine to take back Crimea — annexed by Russia in 2014 and which it deems crucial for its security — could lead to a dangerous escalation by Moscow, possibly even the use of nuclear weapons. As Ukrainian forces have made advances against Russian troops in the south and east, Ukraine’s military aims have hardened: it is seeking the return of territory occupied since February and land occupied in the 2014 Russian assault. Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fate of Crimea was rising on the international agenda. I understand that everyone is confused by the situation and what will happen to Crimea. If someone is ready to offer us a way regarding the de-occupation of Crimea by non-military means, I will only be in favour. If the solution [does not involve] de-occupation and [Crimea] is part of the Russian Federation, no one should waste their time on this. It’s a waste of time. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has said. Reuters reports: The Hague-based organisation, created in the wake of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, opened an office in Kyiv in July to help Ukraine to document and track down missing people. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from their family members, or had died and had been buried in makeshift graves. The process of investigating the missing in Ukraine will last years even after fighting stops, Holliday told Reuters in an interview. The 15,000 figure is conservative when considering that in the port city of Mariupol alone authorities estimate as many as 25,000 people are either dead or missing. He said: The numbers are huge and the challenges that Ukraine faces are vast. Besides which they’re fighting an ongoing war as well against the Russian Federation. What is key now is setting in place all the correct measures to ensure that as many persons can be identified. The vast majority of missing persons, those deceased, are victims of war crimes, and the perpetrators need to be held responsible. By storing DNA samples on a database and seeking matches with relatives, the ICMP accounted for more than 27,000 out of 40,000 persons reported missing during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In Kyiv, the ICMP has started to collect DNA samples and is ramping up capacity for a multi-year process that will also help prosecutors build war crimes cases. The Guardian’s video team have published footage of medics at a hospital in the Ukrainian capital carrying out a cardiac operation on a child despite the city’s blackouts amid Russian missile strikes. According to Borys Todurov, the surgeon who filmed the operation, it was already under way when the electricity supply was suddenly cut. He said: This is how we perform heart surgery today. European Union governments remain split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with more talks possible on Friday if positions converge. Reuters reports: The EU states failed to reach a deal on the price level for Russian sea-borne oil on Wednesday because a Group of Seven nations (G7) proposal for a cap of $65-70 per barrel was seen as far to high by some and too low by others. The European Commission, the Czech EU presidency, the United States and G7 presidency Germany were all engaged in talks on Thursday to bridge differences and reach a deal before the price cap is due to come into force on 5 December. Diplomats said that six of the EU’s 27 countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7. Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit. Lithuania and Estonia back Poland. Cyprus, Greece and Malta, countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose most if Russian oil cargoes are obstructed, argue the cap is too low and want compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. One EU diplomat said: There are a lot of bilateral talks going on now at very high levels. There will be a meeting of representatives of all EU countries once there is progress. There is no point in calling another meeting if there is no change. The first reactor of Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant has been reconnected to the country’s power grid, regional governor Serhiy Hamaliy said. The Khmelnytskyi plant disconnected from Ukraine’s grid on Wednesday after Russian strikes on the country’s power system, Ukrainian officials said. Meanwhile, Russia’s Transneft said that pumping of oil through the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline had resumed at 6pm Moscow time, the TASS news agency reported, citing a company spokesperson. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Orban told a briefing after a meeting of the Visegrad Group in Slovakia that his government had already decided that Hungary would support Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato accession and that the country’s parliament would set this item on its agenda at its first session next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. US President Joe Biden has confirmed that a price cap on Russian oil being proposed by the United States and its western allies is “in play”, adding that he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the issue. He made his comments to reporters during a Thanksgiving holiday visit to a fire station on Nantucket Island. Reuters has the full detail on the prisoner of war swaps: Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow have confirmed. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured. Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said on Telegram that Ukraine received 48 soldiers and two officers, among them marines, infantrymen, border guards and members of the territorial defence. He said: We have managed to bring back 19 defenders of Mariupol ... as well as 15 prisoners (of war) from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and seven from Zmiiny Island. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed head of the part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region that is under Russian control, said earlier that a prisoner swap with Kyiv was taking place, involving 50 prisoners on each side. Kyiv and Moscow have so far swapped over 1,000 prisoners of war since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in February. The Ukraine Solidarity Project, a group of European and Ukrainian activists who target brands with ties to Russia, has unfurled a 400m2 banner outside energy drink company Red Bull’s headquarters in Salzburg depicting Vladimir Putin riding the company’s famous bull logo. The banner reads “Red Bull gives Putin wings” in reference to the company’s decision not to pull its products from Russian supermarkets. Red Bull was given a failing D grade by the Yale School of Management’s Russia business policy ranking for having postponed future planned investment and marketing while continuing “substantive business” in Russia. The Ukraine Solidarity Project said: It really matters that Red Bull is still on sale in Russia. It’s one of the world’s biggest brands and its decision to stick with Putin’s Russia is highly significant. Companies that sell their products there are paying taxes to the Kremlin and signalling that they’re comfortable with the illegal invasion of Ukraine. They need to pull out. As things stand, Red Bull gives Putin wings. Russia’s defence ministry has announced that Ukraine has released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured, in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides. Earlier today, the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said Russia would also release 50 captured Ukrainians. Romania is willing to continue supplying neighbouring Moldova with electricity as Russian shelling in Ukraine hits its energy supply, but insufficient interconnections are a challenge, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis has said. “Up until now we have delivered everything we were asked for,” Iohannis told reporters after meeting Lithuania’s president in Vilnius. “But outages happen because … Romanian-Moldovan interconnections are completely insufficient. Most of the power Romania is offering passes through Ukraine.” Romanian power producers started selling electricity to Moldova at a capped price in October, Reuters reported. Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said earlier this week the EU state was providing between 80% and 90% of Moldova’s electricity needs. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Russia’s attacks on civilian infrastructure are an intolerable, inhumane crime. Putin may plunge the people of Ukraine into cold and darkness with his missiles. He will never break their will for freedom and our support,” she added. A meeting of Nato foreign ministers is scheduled to take place in Bucharest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Reuters reported. A G7 foreign ministers meeting held in Germany earlier this month on Baerbock’s initiative focused on how to support Ukraine through the winter in the face of Russian attacks on its power grid. Ukrainian cities were plunged into darkness this week after a barrage of Russian missiles triggered one of the worst nationwide power outages of the war yet. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel said she had aimed to convene European talks with Vladimir Putin the year before his invasion of Ukraine but in the end did not see any possibility of influencing the Russian president at the end of her term. Merkel told the Spiegel news magazine in an interview published on Thursday that she and French president Emmanuel Macron had planned to hold an independent talk format with Putin within the European Council in 2021, her last summer in office. “But I no longer had the strength to push through because, after all, everyone knew: she’s leaving in autumn,” she said. Merkel, who retired from politics after 16 years in power following Germany’s September 2021 election, officially handed over the reins to Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats in December that year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden met the Russian leader in June 2021. Referring to her farewell visit to Moscow in August 2021, Merkel, who speaks fluent Russian, told Spiegel: The feeling was very clear: ‘In terms of power politics, you’re through.’ For Putin, only power counts. The leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic have publicly criticised Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, over the war in Ukraine. Reuters reports: Unity within the Visegrad Group, set up in 1991 as the region emerged from decades of communist rule, has been sorely tested by the war, with Orbán opposing harsher European sanctions on Russia including on energy supplies. By contrast, Hungary’s three Visegrad neighbours – which also include Slovakia – are among the EU’s toughest critics of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, said as he headed for a meeting of Visegrad leaders in Slovakia on Thursday: This is not the best of times for the (Visegrad) format, and Hungary’s different attitudes are significantly influencing and complicating the situation. I make no secret of the fact that the views of the Hungarian prime minister, some of which can even be described as provocative, do not help this cooperation to proceed as well as in the past. This week Orbán further annoyed his neighbours by wearing a scarf to a soccer match that depicted some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, prompting Kyiv to summon the Hungarian ambassador to lodge a protest. Fiala said on Wednesday the “Greater Hungary” scarf – which also showed territory now in Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia as part of Hungary – would be discussed at Thursday’s summit gathering in the Slovak city of Kosice. Poland, an ally of Hungary in their past disputes with the EU over the rule of law and human rights, has also turned more critical of Orbán because of his stance on Ukraine. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, criticised Hungary’s failure so far to ratify Sweden and Finland’s application to join Nato. He said: I will tell (Orbán) directly that for Poland this is one of the most important changes in international law, that is the accession of Finland and Sweden. We can’t allow the Visegrad Group to fall apart. It is a structure which protects the interests of our countries against other interest groups from western Europe. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief has said. Reuters reports that Petro Kotin, head of nuclear power company Energoatom, said the vast nuclear power station in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, which has been out of commission since September, had also been disconnected from the grid on Wednesday and became reliant on backup diesel generators. He added that the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since soon after Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago, had been reconnected to the grid by Thursday morning and that the backup generators were turned off. He said in a written statement: There is a real danger of a nuclear and radiation catastrophe being caused by firing on the entire territory of Ukraine with Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, and a huge risk of damage to nuclear plants. Russia must answer for this shameful crime. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Each side has blamed the other for shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant complex. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. In a broadcast clip circulating on social media for its controversial comments, Lukashenko said that “everything is in Ukraine’s hands now if they don’t want a huge number of people to die”. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Advisor to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Anton Gerashchenko, tweeted that this was “theatre of [the] absurd”. Hungary has obtained an exemption from the EU’s proposed Russian oil price cap during talks in Brussels, according to the country’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó. Szijjarto said at a briefing in Brussels broadcast on his Facebook page that the European Union’s current proposal says that oil deliveries though pipelines would be exempt from the price cap, which means it would not affect Hungary if the proposed cap is adopted later. A snap from Reuters suggests that Russia and Ukraine will each exchange 50 prisoners of war today, according to the Russian-installed leader in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, who posted on the Telegram messaging service. More details to follow. Russia does not plan to supply oil to countries supporting a price cap on Russian oil, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Ukraine’s leadership could “end suffering” in Ukraine by meeting Russia’s demands to resolve the conflict. Peskov was asked whether Russia was worried about the effect on the civilian population of its strikes on energy infrastructure, which have caused repeated mass blackouts. Peskov said Russia attacked targets of military, not “social”, relevance. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the next few hours. If there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line at rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Rachel Hall will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, initially said he received Germany’s offer with “satisfaction”. But following Russia’s heavy barrage of Ukraine on Wednesday, Polish leaders said it would be better if the defence systems were placed in western Ukraine. The head of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, called Germany’s offer “interesting” but said he believed “it would be best for Poland’s security if Germany handed the equipment to the Ukrainians, trained Ukrainian teams, with the caveat that the batteries would be placed in Ukraine’s west”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Warsaw, Vasyl Zvarych, thanked Błaszczak, saying on Twitter that Ukraine needs as many air defence weapons as it can get. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. “We are working hard to hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine and I can announce today that we are working full speed on a 9th sanctions package,” von der Leyen told a news conference. “And I’m confident that we will very soon approve a global price cap on Russian oil with the G7 and other major partners. We will not rest until Ukraine has prevailed over Putin and his unlawful and barbaric war,” she said. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Meanwhile, Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Reuters reported: The sources said the talks were being mediated by the Gulf Arab state and did not include the United Nations despite the UN’s central role in negotiating the ongoing initiative to export agricultural products from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Ammonia is used to make fertiliser. However, the talks aim to remove remaining obstacles in the initiative extended last week and ease global food shortages by unblocking Ukrainian and Russian exports, they added. The sources asked not to be named in order to freely discuss sensitive matters. The Russian and Ukrainian representatives travelled to the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on 17 November where they discussed allowing Russia to resume ammonia exports in exchange for a prisoner swap that would release a large number of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately establish what progress was made at the talks. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the plant, which both Ukraine and Moscow have accused each other of shelling, Reuters reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. “The government continues to be committed to take part in financial support to war-gripped Ukraine,” the government said in the decree. “So it calls on the finance minister to make sure to provide the €187m that would be Hungary’s share in the €18bn EU loan to be granted to Ukraine.” The decree, signed by Orbán, also says that the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, should start talks with Ukraine to work out an agreement needed for the financial assistance. To secure the funds for the loans, which Ukraine will have to repay within 35 years, the European Commission would borrow on the capital markets. However, proposals for the package will need to be approved by the European parliament and the EU’s 27 member states and Hungary said it would not take part in joint borrowing. Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television.

The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. The temperature plunged below zero degrees Celsius overnight in a city that had 2.8 million residents before the war and where it is already snowing and the streets are icy, Reuters reported. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said electricians and repair workers were doing everything to get the power back on “as fast as possible” but the recovery would depend largely on the overall energy “balance” of the nationwide grid. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s staff, said power supplies had been restored in the Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia regions. In the south, the Mykolaiv region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim, appealed to Ukrainians to be as frugal as possible in their use of power. “Consumption has been growing this morning [which is logical], there isn’t enough capacity in the system to switch it on for more consumers!!,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “The energy system is united like we all are! If you’ve turned off a few unneeded lights, that’s really important!!!” Ukrainian servicemen shoot towards Russian positions on the frontline near Kherson, southern Ukraine. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Among those fighting the Russians in Bakhmut are a unit of Chechen fighters, who hope a Ukrainian victory could spark political crisis in Russia and bring down the powerful pro-Moscow leader of Chechnya. Further south, Russian forces were digging in on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, the general staff said, shelling areas on the west bank including the town of Kherson, which was recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I have the honor to inform you of the end of my mission as permanent delegate of the Russian Federation to Unesco,” Russian ambassador Alexander Kuznetsov said on Tuesday in a letter to the members of the World Heritage Committee obtained by AFP. The resignation will allow the committee to “quickly appoint a new president” and resume its activities, a UN diplomat told AFP. Russia’s position as chair of the committee had sparked an outcry among other members following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The committee had been due to meet in June in the Russian city of Kazan, but 46 countries, including France and the UK, boycotted the event. The meeting was supposed to update the landscapes, monuments and cities included in the body’s list of heritage sites. Unesco regulations dictate that replacements for a resigning committee chair are to be appointed by the country that follows in alphabetical order in English. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s energy ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops off nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger report from Kyiv: Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said: “It’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war. “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link: Hello, my name is Helen Sullivan and you’re reading the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations Security Council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror. This is all against our energy infrastructure... Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered,” Zelenskiy said via video link to the council chamber. At least 10 people were killed in the strikes, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said, including a two-day-old infant.

UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:37:36Z","webTitle":"EDF cuts output at nuclear power plants as French rivers get too warm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","fields":{"bodyText":"The French energy supplier EDF is temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as heatwaves push up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. The majority-state-owned company, Europe’s biggest producer of nuclear energy, said it would extend output cuts at several power stations on the two rivers as the hot spell continues – but that a minimum level of output would be maintained to keep the grid steady. EDF warned of potential output cuts at its nuclear power plants Tricastin, St Alban and Golfech in coming days due to high temperatures in the Rhône and Garonne rivers. It started imposing production restrictions in mid-July at Tricastin, St Alban and Bugey on the Rhône and Blayais at the mouth of the Garonne amid sweltering temperatures. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the company was lowering production “for a few hours” where possible but not shutting the reactors completely. After the 2003 heatwave, France’s nuclear safety authority (ASN) set temperature and river flow limits beyond which power stations must reduce their production, to ensure the water used to cool the plants will not harm wildlife when it is released back into the rivers. Temperatures in southern France are expected to reach 40C over the next two days, according to the forecaster Météo-France. Since 2000, production losses due to high river temperatures and low river flows have represented an average of 0.3% of annual production. However, half of EDF’s 56 nuclear reactors are offline due to planned maintenance and work to repair corrosion which was delayed by the pandemic, just as Europe faces an energy crunch following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the maintenance work, EDF estimates its power output this year will be the lowest in more than three decades. The company issued its fourth profit warning of the year last Thursday when it reported a first-half loss of €5.3bn. The French government, which owns 84% of EDF, is in the process of buying out minority shareholders to take full control of the business. The production cuts mean that France, traditionally an energy exporter, is relying on imports from countries such as Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the UK. EDF is buying electricity at high market prices, after Russia’s war in Ukraine sparked an energy crisis, leaving European countries scrambling to find alternative supplies. Another strain on EDF’s finances comes from a power tariff cap imposed by the government to shield consumers from soaring energy prices. The latest power cuts threaten to push energy prices even higher after they were sent spiralling by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T18:50:51Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant reconnected to energy grid as UN warns ‘one day our luck will run out’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN gave an urgent warning regarding Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being disconnected. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday killed at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. A close ally of Alexei Navalny has resigned his post at the opposition leader’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) after it was revealed that he had signed letters calling for the EU to drop sanctions against several UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs. Leonid Volkov confirmed he had signed and sent a 2022 letter to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, in which he called for Brussels to relax sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and business partners German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichev, in a scandal marked by infighting among Russia’s contentious liberal and opposition circles. “This letter was a big political mistake,” wrote Volkov in a post on Thursday where he uploaded the October 2022 letter to Borrell. “Worse, by doing this, I exceeded my authority – I signed it not in my personal capacity, but on behalf of the organisation. I did not inform my colleagues, and, therefore, I also put them [on the letter].” Volkov said he would resign from ACF International’s board and “take a break from my public socio-political activity”. The organisation had earlier published a list of 6,000 “bribetakers and warmongers” it said should be issued with sanctions by western countries. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has expressed concern over the recent power outage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Thursday, power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. During a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of directors held in Vienna, Rafael Grossi criticised the organisation’s complacency in preventing such incidents from happening, noting that its primary role was to ensure nuclear safety. ‘What are we doing to prevent this happening? We are the IAEA, we are meant to care about nuclear safety,’ Grossi told its board of directors in a meeting on Thursday in Vienna. ‘Each time we are rolling a dice,’ he said. You can watch the video here: The German chancellor has said that Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a group of German reporters, Scholz said: “Unfortunately, I see no willingness at the moment,” Scholz was quoted by NBR as saying, adding Ukraine must decide what conditions it is ready to accept for peace. Scholz said that energy supply in Europe’s biggest economy would be sufficient next winter and that the German economy was heading for growth rates last seen in the 1950s and 1960s due to heavy investment in climate protection. Reuters has reported that Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states who are deemed “most hostile” to Moscow. Reuters reports: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - ruled from Moscow during the Cold War but now members of the European Union and NATO - have been among the strongest critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the move was a response to what it called active lobbying by the three Baltic republics for more sanctions against Russia and to their “interference in our internal affairs, inciting Russophobic sentiments”. Last year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began restricting the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus in response to what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. You can read the full report below: “Russia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,” military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius told reporters. “We estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today,” he added. He noted that the assessment depended on the perspective that no foreign country would provide military aid to Moscow. Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to “cause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,” he said. He spoke alongside his counterpart from civilian intelligence at a presentation of their annual report. Beyond estimates of Russian resources, the report also suggested that Russia’s mobilisation last year showed that support for the war in Ukraine “is not as big as the regime’s propaganda tried to make it seem”. “Dissatisfaction with the regime’s policies is currently taking a passive form: mostly avoiding mobilisation, complaining about poor provision and disarray in the army,” the document said. It also raised the possibility that Russia’s failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation and a sudden deterioration of the economic situation “would have negative consequences for the stability of the regime”. Lithuania, a member of both the European Union and NATO, has been a major backer of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February last year. Serhii Andrushko, a Ukrainian reporter, has said that his country’s struggle for freedom also includes another kind of war - against high-level corruption - which experts think could have more success now as Kyiv strives for European Union membership. Reuters reports: Last month, the Radio Liberty correspondent confronted candidates on camera vying to become Kyiv’s next top anti-corruption official about their personal finances and political ties. That might seem less urgent when soldiers are dying every day, but part of Ukraine’s battle includes shedding any perceived similarities to Russia. “Particularly its attitude to corruption,” Andrushko said. According to Transparency International’s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked slightly better than Russia but still well below the global average. So reporters like Andrushko say they are working to keep their rulers honest, a job some experts and media insiders said could have more impact now that Kyiv is under pressure to prove it can clean up its act as it seeks membership in the European Union. They said a major political shake-up seen earlier this year, when more than a dozen officials were dismissed amid a flurry of critical domestic press coverage, could be a taste of things to come if Ukraine’s investigative journalists continue. Their focus also shows civil society is embracing its role as a government watchdog even as the war grinds on. “Media are becoming more influential because they’re appealing to the more acute sense of justice among citizens,” said researcher Petro Burkovskyy, of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank. They will need to choose stories wisely and back up their reporting, he added, since being sloppy or overly critical can invite public scepticism or even accusations of being unpatriotic. Many journalists are also turning their attention to uncovering Russian war crimes and assets in Ukraine. Here is some more detailed reporting on Ukraine’s national grid being reconnected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station today. Reuters reports: Back-up diesel generators - a last line of defence to prevent meltdown from overheating reactor fuel - kicked in after external power was lost to the plant early on Thursday, but they have only enough fuel to power it for 10 days. Ukraine blamed Russia for the loss of power to the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Officials in the part of the Zaporizhzhia region which is occupied by Russia called it a “provocation” by Kyiv. The incident renewed fears of an accident at Europe’s largest atomic power station, nearly four decades after the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but national grid operator Ukrenergo signalled that repairs had been carried out quickly. “Specialists of ‘Ukrenergo’ have restored the power supply of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant), which was interrupted by today’s missile strikes,” it said in a statement. “The ZNPP is switching from diesel generators to receiving electricity for its own needs from the unified energy system of Ukraine.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of compromising safety by shelling the site of the plant, forcing power cuts during air strikes and flouting safety measures. Russia has denied shelling the site, and has accused Ukraine of being behind the shelling. “The risks of disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP are significantly increasing, and our ability to react to them, to avoid them are significantly decreasing,” Oleh Korikov, acting chairman of the Ukrainian state nuclear safety watchdog, told a news briefing on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, also expressed alarm after confirming the back-up generators had kicked in. Calling for a protection zone around the plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the watchdog’s Board of Governors: “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out.” IAEA monitors are currently on site and Grossi has been pressing both sides to establish a demilitarised “safe zone” around the station. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. In the past year, the comedian turned politician has appeared via satellite during the Grammy awards and Golden Globes and within film festivals such as Cannes and most recently Berlin. Last month marked the one year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine. Zelenskiy had secured Mike Simpson, a top power agent at major agency WME, after his client Aaron Kaufman co-directed Ukraine documentary Superpower made with Sean Penn, who loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskiy last year. The actor called it “a symbolic silly thing” but after Ukraine wins the war against Russia, he could bring it back to him. He had previously promised to smelt an Oscar if the Academy didn’t let him speak. “There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelensky] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” he said. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. EU countries plan to pool demand and sign their first joint gas contracts in the coming months, to help fill storage caverns ahead of peak winter demand as Europe replaces Russian gas. “Ukraine has indicated that on top of their own domestic production, they might need, for a secure winter, another 2 billion cubic metres,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told a news conference on Thursday. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who leads the EU’s joint gas-buying, held a video call with international gas suppliers on Wednesday. Sefcovic said Europe was on track to expand its capacity to regasify liquefied natural gas to 227 billion cubic metres by 2024, up from 178 bcm now, as countries swap Russian gas for other supplies. Participating in the EU scheme could help Ukraine to stave off gas shortages. Of the 27.3 bcm of gas Ukraine used in 2021, domestic production accounted for about 19.8 bcm, imports were 2.6 bcm and 4.9 bcm of gas was taken from underground storage. Initial estimates from state-owned energy firm Naftogaz suggest Ukrainian gas production was around 18 bcm in 2022. Ukraine uses little gas to produce electricity, but relies on the fuel for heating and industry - sectors vulnerable should Russian strikes damage infrastructure. Ukraine does not import gas directly from Russia, but Ukrainian pipelines still carry some Russian gas to Europe. Russia has bombarded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent months, and on Thursday launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Kadri Simson said she would convene an emergency video call with Ukraine and EU energy ministers on Thursday to discuss the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, after Kyiv said Russian attacks had severed the plant from the power grid and forced it onto emergency diesel power. Russian strikes hit targets across a sleeping Ukraine early on Thursday. The capital, Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, were some of the places struck by a barrage of missiles, knocking out power to several areas. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv and the strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the European Union is completely ignoring any talks on the need to carry out an investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts, Reuters reports. Russia has repeatedly asked to be allowed to join the investigations into the blasts, which ruptured three of the four pipelines of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas links that connect Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Earlier today the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described it as “incomprehensible” that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the south command of the Ukrainian armed forces has claimed to have destroyed a Russian self-propelled artillery installation on the Kinburn spit. The claim has not been independently verified. The Kinburn spit is a stretch of land that stretches out from Kherson oblast to the west, and is opposite the southern coast of Ukraine that runs from Odesa to Mykolaiv. It is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed. Petr Pavel, a former Czech army chief and high-level Nato official, took the oath of office to start his five-year term as Czech president on Thursday. Pavel beat populist former prime minister Andrej Babiš in a January election on pledges to firmly anchor the central European country in the European Union and Nato, a turn away from the policy of predecessor Miloš Zeman, who had tried to boost relations with Russia and China. Pavel, a social liberal who campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, has tried to convey a message of unity after the divisive Zeman, who retired after 10 years in office on Wednesday. Reuters reports Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties, but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has fully supported continued aid for Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s invasion. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine was reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid on Thursday, Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Energoatom had said earlier on Thursday that power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said she believed that Russia’s latest assault on the country was an attempt to make citizens feel as though the country was “not safe” to continue living in. Sovsun added that she thought the primary purpose of the attacks was to “make sure everybody feels scared” after a period of relative safety in the country’s capital, Kyiv. Reuters reports that local security services in the Moscow-backed breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova said on they had thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt against the region’s leader, according to Russian state news agencies reported. Reuters reports: Kyiv rejected the claims as a Kremlin “provocation”, the latest in a series of allegations, claims and counterclaims over escalating tensions in the territory, wedged along Ukraine’s south-western border with Moldova. It was not immediately clear whether the Transnistrian officials had provided evidence to support their claim. “The ministry of state security informs about the prevention of a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine, a crime was being prepared against a number of officials. The suspects have been detained,” the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted the ministry as saying. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that the accusation “should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin”. It added: “Lies and provocations are the weapons (Russia) actively uses. But today the entire world sees the true face of the aggressor country and does not believe the statements of Russia or its satellites.” Transnistria, a mainly Russian-speaking territory which borders Ukraine, broke from Moldova’s control in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is dependent on Russian support. Its allegiance to Moscow and location on Ukraine’s western border have been a constant cause of concern since Russia invaded that the war could spread to the region. Last month, Russia accused Ukraine of planning to invade Transnistria after staging a ‘false flag’ operation there, a claim Kyiv denied. Moldova also rejected Russia’s claim. Moscow also said it would view as an attack on itself any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers stationed in Transnistria. In a statement this morning about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time – let me say it again sixth time, that ZNPP has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Let me remind you - this is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.” He added: “What are we doing? How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on. I am astonished by the complacency. What are we doing to prevent this from happening? Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out”. You can read an explainer regarding the significance of the power plant here: The South Korean company Hyundai Motor Co is in talks with a Kazakhstan company over the sale of its manufacturing plant in Russia, it has been reported. Reuters reports: Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of hi-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of western manufacturers since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. The local government in St Petersburg has been negotiating with Kazakhstan to sell Hyundai’s Russia plant, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a Tass report. Yonhap reported that negotiations to sell Hyundai’s plant in St Petersburg to an auto-related company in Astana, Kazakhstan, are in the final stage, citing an unnamed source. The deal could be signed as early as June, it said. Hyundai suspended operations at its Russian factory last March. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Intense fighting has continued in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The below graphic shows the Russian military advances within the region. A residential building in Lviv oblast has been targeted by Russian missiles. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of the Lviv oblast administration, released drone footage showing the aftermath of the attack on Thursday. A fifth person had died in overnight strikes, the governor said. Reuters has reported more details on the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday, killing at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Reuters reports: The first big volley of missile strikes since mid-February shattered the longest period of comparative calm since Moscow began a campaign to attack Ukraine’s civil infrastructure five months ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile that destroyed a village house in the western Lviv region, according to emergency services. Drone footage from the area, some 700 km (440 miles) from any military battlefield, showed a flattened home surrounded by badly damaged buildings. Another civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson. In the capital Kyiv, residents were awakened by explosions. A seven-hour air strike alert through the night was the longest of the Russian air campaign that began in October. “I heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,” said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms. “It’s very frightening. Very frightening. The child got scared and jumped out of bed,” she said. “How can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans, I don’t know what to call them. They are frightening the children, their mental state will be disrupted.” Moscow says its campaign of targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure far from the front is intended to reduce its ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which President Vladimir Putin regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which NATO has no answer. Ukraine said the missiles had knocked out the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, severing it from the Ukrainian grid. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster there caused by fighting. Moscow said the was being kept safe on diesel backup power. “Everything is absolutely normal: the specialists at the plant are working quite professionally, the automation has started up,” Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of Russian state energy firm Rosenergoatom, said on state TV channel Rossiya 24. “There is no threat or danger of a nuclear incident. There is more than enough fuel and, if necessary, it will be supplied to the plant.” Alessio Mamo has been at the scene of today’s strike on Kyiv for the Guardian. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. In a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, UN secretary general António Guterres told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tobi Thomas will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Another series of air raid sirens have just sounded across Ukraine, including in Odesa and Kherson in the south, Lviv in the west and Sumy in the north. The air raid alert in Kyiv overnight lasted for seven hours, as a total of 81 missiles were fired at targets across the country by Russia. Reuters reports that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia and other countries had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multibillion-dollar pipelines last September. He added it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. German prosecutors confirmed yesterday that investigators had searched a boat that may have been used in the bombings. Earlier today our First Edition newsletter carried some analysis of the situation, with Archie Bland speaking to our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh. Here is what they had to say about the range of people who might be considered responsible for the attack: While the consequences for European energy supplies have not ultimately proven severe, there are wider implications, Sabbagh said. “Technically this is an attack in international waters, but it’s within the Nato sphere. It’s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.” If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine. If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US – particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany. And evidence of Moscow’s culpability “would be a new frontier in Russian aggression,” Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies “would further unite the west against Putin”. You can read more of that analysis here: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage – and who may be responsible Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. “We have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,” Reuters reports the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told a meeting of EU lawmakers. EU countries plan to sign their first contracts to jointly buy gas by this summer. The Kremlin said on Thursday that there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the Black Sea grain deal, and that there were currently no plans for a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The deal, which allows grain to be safely exported from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade, expires on 18 March, but cannot be extended if Russia objects. Moscow has already signalled it is unhappy with aspects of the deal, as it seeks to expand the markets for its own agricultural products. Ukraine has said it will seek to extend the deal for at least a year, and wishes the port of Mykolaiv to be included. Kyiv said Russian shelling killed three people on Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, as Moscow unleashed a wave of missile strikes overnight. “Russian terrorists shelled Kherson in the morning. They hit … a public transport stop. Three people died as a result of the shelling,” AFP reports Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. In its report Tass writes: Assassination attempts on a number of officials of Transnistria were prepared on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service (SBU), the ministry of state security of the republic reported. Suspects of preparing an assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria were detained and are giving confessions. The impending assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria is qualified as a preparation for a terrorist attack. The prosecutor of Transnistria said that the SBU was preparing a terrorist attack using a car bomb in the center of Tiraspol. The claims have not been independently verified. Transnistria, which attempted to break away from Moldova in the early 1990s, borders Ukraine’s west and has Russian troops stationed there. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. “I think it is time to make a decision,” Reuters reports Nad said on Facebook. “People are dying in Ukraine, we can really help them, there is no room for Slovak politicking.” The governor of Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, has given further details of the strike that has killed five people. In a message on Telegram he posted to say: Today, around 4 o’clock in the morning, an enemy missile fell in the Zolochiv district during an air raid. Three men and two women who were at home at that moment died. The fire destroyed three residential buildings, three cars, a garage and several outbuildings. The fire was extinguished. The demolition of the destroyed buildings has already been completed. 28 rescuers, five units of special equipment and a canine team were involved in the work. Drone footage shows the aftermath of the strike. The regional governor said air defences shot down missiles over Lviv, but “I cannot say exactly how many missiles were destroyed over our region, the relevant services have asked not to make this information public” and he urged the public not to release details. Kozytskyi went on to say: As usual, during the day, internally displaced people arrived in our region by evacuation trains, and people also left by train to Przemyśl [in Poland]. In the districts of Lviv oblast, humanitarian aid was collected and handed over to soldiers on the frontlines and to residents of frontline settlements, cars were sent to the defenders. Our foreign partners transferred aid to the communities of the region. Everyone lived yesterday, doing good deeds and getting closer to victory in their place. But we woke up to sirens, and news about the dead. We will never forget this day. We will never forgive. And we will direct all our efforts to revenge and the return of justice. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes on Ukraine as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. In a tweet he said: Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, leading to loss of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. No military objective, just Russian barbarism. The day will come when Putin and his associates are held accountable by a special tribunal. Reuters reports that Nato member Denmark has confirmed that Troels Lund Poulsen will continue to act as acting defence minister in the absence of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Ellemann-Jensen, 49, was briefly admitted to hospital in February after making a trip to Ukraine and has been on an indefinite period of sick leave. At the time he said in a Facebook message: “I have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending me a signal that it’s time to take a break, if not it’s going to end badly.” Here are some more of the images to come out of Kyiv today. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his official Telegram about the night’s events, writing: It’s been a difficult night. A massive rocket attack across the country. Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia regions. Attacks on critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families. All services are working. The energy system is being restored. Restrictions were imposed in all regions. The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done. We thank the guardians of our skies and everyone who helps to overcome the consequences of the occupiers’ sneaking attacks. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has posted this summary to Telegram of the latest news to emerge from the overnight strikes. It reports: In Kyiv, the alarm lasted for about seven hours. Two people were hospitalised due to falling rocket fragments. Five people were killed in the Zolochiv district of the Lviv region due to a rocket hitting a residential area, one person was killed and two were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Energy infrastructure and industrial enterprises were also damaged in the region. About 15 strikes were made in Kharkiv and the region, two people were injured. Critical infrastructure was targeted. Metro and electric transport are not working. In Kirovohrad oblast, Odesa oblast and Zhytomyr oblast, energy infrastructure facilities were hit. Also, according to preliminary information, there are hits in Vinnytsia. At night, electricity restrictions were applied preventively in all regions to reduce risks to the system. Emergency power outages were used in regions where infrastructure was damaged. Kharkiv region and Zhytomyr region are partially de-energized. Kharkiv is completely without electricity. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some more images from the scene of the strike in Kyiv. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has announced that a fifth person has been killed in overnight strikes. He posted to Telegram to say: The number of people killed as a result of the fall of the rocket in the Zolochiv district has increased to five. The body of another man, born in 1963, was discovered under the rubble. Sincere condolences to the relatives. Ukraine’s air force has issued a statement via Telegram on the wave of attacks from Russia overnight. In it, it claims that “the defence forces of Ukraine destroyed 34 cruise missiles … as well as 4 ‘Shahed-136/131’ unmanned aerial vehicles”. It claims that a total of 48 Kalibr-type cruise missiles had been fired by Russia. It described the attack as featuring “81 missiles of various types” in total, and that “the launches were carried out from 10 Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighters, six MiG-31K aircraft and three Kalibr KR carriers in the Black Sea”. It adds: “As a result of organised countermeasures, 8 Kh-31P and Kh-59 guided air missiles did not reach their targets. It is worth noting that the armed forces of Ukraine do not have means capable of destroying Kh-22 and Kh-47 ‘Kinzhal’ and S-300.” The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that energy company DTEK has reinstated power in Dnipropetrovsk. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has provided this update via Telegram on the situation overnight in his region. He wrote: The enemy launched a massive rocket attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. At least 15 arrivals of S-300 missiles were recorded. Critical infrastructure objects are hit. In addition, a civil infrastructure object was damaged in the city of Kharkiv. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn, with one of them hospitalised, and that an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. He added that during the previous day, multiple settlements had been shelled with the result that “houses and commercial buildings were damaged, fires broke out”. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires of the aftermath of strikes on Kyiv overnight. That’s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’ll be handing over to my colleague Martin Belam shortly. Here is what happened overnight, as Russia launched mass strikes across a sleeping Ukraine: Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he won’t meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “Residents of Lviv oblast, an air alert lasted for four hours this night … In Zolochiv district, an enemy rocket fell in a residential area. A fire started. It has already been extinguished,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them.” Three residential buildings were destroyed. Kozytskyi posted a video of the damage: More now on Zaporizhzhia. The statement from state energy company Energoatom says: On the night of 9 March, the enemy delivered another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. “As a result of shelling, the last line that fed the ZNPP was damaged. Now the station works on diesel generators. The Russians are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. And this is the day after the negotiations with the UN on the demilitarization of the ZNPP,” said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Also, as of 6,30am on 9 March, shelling of energy facilities was recorded in the Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr regions. Here is our wrap of the attacks overnight: Volleys of Russian missiles struck targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second city of Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also hit, but no casualties were immediately reported. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitschko has just confirmed that one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents are now without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. It is currently 8am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of what has happened overnight: Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were registered in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. Power supply has been cut pre-emptively to about 15% of Kyiv residents, he said. The strikes cut Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant off from the power grid, the company Energoatom announced on Thursday morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s National Grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Zelenskiy said he won’t meet with Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is a photo from Svyatoshyn in Kyiv, where missile strikes set cars alight: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been off from the Ukrainian power grid, the power company Energoatom announced this morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Missile strikes in Zhytomyr have left people in the city without water, according to the mayor. Air sirens are sounding in Mykolaiv, the governor, Vitalii Kim, has just said on Telegram. Electricity supply has been cut for 15% of people in Kyiv, the mayor, Vitalii Klychko, said. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klychko has confirmed that there has been another explosion in the city, this time in Svyatoshyn district. He said that there were two people injured. “Another explosion in the capital. Svyatoshyn district. All services go to the place. Cars are burning in the yard of one of the residential buildings. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters! Two injured in Sviatoshyn district. Medics provide assistance on the spot.” The CEO of Ukrainian power company Yasno, Serhii Kovalenko, has said that emergency power cuts have been put in place due to the mass strikes. “Morning. Emergency blackouts are used due to the enemy attack. This is a preventive step, as you all remember,” he said. It is currently 7.20 am in Kyiv. The Kyiv Independent reports that, according to one of its journalists, another loud explosion was heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago. “This is nowhere near over,” The British Ambassador to Ukraine has just said on Twitter. Maxim Tucker of the Times has posted a video of what he says is smoke rising from Kyiv thermo-electric power station this morning: New Voice of Ukraine journalist Euan MacDonald said that the Kyiv explosion was “near Troyeshyna on left bank of Dnipro (there’s a heat-power plant nearby). Must have been a big bang if I heard it 10km?” Kyiv’s mayor has reported that Russia has struck Kyiv during its latest mass strikes accoss Ukraine. “Explosions in the Holosiiv district of the capital. All services follow in place. More details later,” Kyiv’s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram a few minutes ago. Reporters in Kyiv said they heard a loud explosion at around 6am. The explosions are part of a pre-dawn wave of mass strikes by Russia launched before dawn on Thursday. Maxim Tucker of the Times posted a video of what he said was smoke rising from a thermo-electric power station in Kyiv: Explosions were also reported in Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. Air raid sirens sounded across the country. Ukrainian newspaper Dzerkalo Tyzhnia is also reporting an explosion in Kyiv, as well as blasts heard in the city of Sumy, and a drone spotted above the western Lviv region. The Kyiv Post is reporting that one of its journalists has heard explosions in the city amid air raid warnings. The Guardian has not verified this independently. Asked by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer whether the US will send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets Zelensky said, “The fighter jets issue is difficult. We’re waiting for this decision to be taken.” “We really need this and really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots, and President Biden told me that it will be worked upon … I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend our skies,” Zelensky said. Zelenskiy invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in the interview with CNN. When told of the invitation McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. Zelenskiy said that his children are still in Ukraine. “My daughter joined the university and she studies there, and my son is attending school in Ukraine,” he said in his CNN interview. “They’re both in Ukraine. They’re very much like other Ukrainian kids. We live with sirens.” “We want victory. We don’t want to get used to war, but we got used to the challenges. Everyone wants one thing: to end the war,” he said. Zelenskiy appeared on CNN this evening in the US, in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word”. “We don’t have any confidence in him,” Zelensky added. “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is more detail on what local officials have said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. “As a result of a mass missile strike, an energy infrastructure site was hit in the region as well as residences,” Marchenko said on Telegram. He said anti-aircraft units had downed some missiles and new attacks could follow. “Fortunately, there are no casualties. Electricity restrictions are in effect.” Kharkiv region Governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by about 15 strikes. “The enemy made about 15 strikes on the city and region,” he said on Telegram. “Infrastructure was again among the targets. Information on casualties is being clarified.” Another strike was reported in the central city of Dnipro and in the western towns of Lutsk and Rivne, far from the front lines in the year-old war. Air raid sirens are sounding across the country before dawn this morning. BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa wrote on Twitter, “It’s 3 am in Ukraine. Russia won’t let Ukrainians sleep tight tonight. Lots of drones and rockets fired in all possible directions in Ukraine … This is the terror civilians’ve been living through for more than a year already.” Analysts and Ukrainian leaders had expected mass missile strikes during the week of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 24 February. The Kyiv Independent reports that explosions have been heard in several cities and regional communities, but we are waiting for confirmation from local officials. The newspaper listed the cities and regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk among those where explosions were heard. Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, Reuters reported, citing regional officials. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Residential areas had also been hit, but no casualties were reported. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. It’s 5am local time in Kyiv, and we have reports of strikes across Ukraine, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. We’ll have more news shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war: The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said. The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN. Zelensky has also called for “democratic success” in Georgia where thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day, against a controversial “foreign agent” bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said in his evening address to the nation. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m, the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish. German officials announced that they searched a ship in January that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation. Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T10:22:36Z","webTitle":"Aukus nuclear submarine deal loophole prompts proliferation fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","fields":{"bodyText":"The Aukus scheme announced on Monday in San Diego represents the first time a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight. On Tuesday, the Chinese mission to the UN accused the US and UK of “clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT”, adding that “such a textbook case of double standard will damage the authority and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation system”. “The nuclear submarine cooperation plan released today by Aukus is a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region,” the mission said. The IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday that Australia, the US and UK had informed it of the deal, but reiterated that the “legal obligations” of the three countries to non-proliferation were “paramount”. “Ultimately, the [IAEA] must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project,” it said. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, supports the steps taken by Aukus, Kyodo News reported. The government said the nuclear-powered submarine procurement plan was explained to Kishida in a phone call with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Tuesday. The Aukus partners have held intensive discussions with the IAEA about the plans and taken steps to limit the risk. Early on in the talks, the idea was floated that paragraph 14 might not be invoked at all, and the nuclear fuel would be kept under IAEA safeguards. However, the IAEA was not prepared to have its inspection standards watered down to the extent that the agency would not be able to determine the timing of a visit, and the Aukus partners were squeamish about letting an international team of inspectors onboard their state-of-the-art submarines. To mitigate the proliferation risk, the Australians have agreed not to have a training reactor on their territory, but to train their submariners in the US and UK instead. Australia will not enrich or reprocess the spent nuclear fuel, and the fissile material provided by the US and UK will come in welded units that do not have to be refuelled in their lifetime. Australia has undertaken not to acquire the equipment necessary to chemically reprocess spent fuel that would make it usable in a weapon. “Since day one of this effort, or consultation period, we have prioritised non-proliferation,” a senior US official said. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said he believes the Aukus partners “are committed to ensuring the highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met”, and noted his “satisfaction with the engagement and transparency shown by the three countries thus far”. “I do think the three countries are quite serious about trying to mitigate the harm to the non-proliferation regime. I think they’ve done a very good job engaging with the IAEA,” James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. “But I still think there is real and concrete harm done. “The primary problem with Aukus was always the precedent set, that Australia would be the first country that would remove nuclear fuel from safeguards for use in naval reactors,” Acton added. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-17T22:37:48Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s inexorable hard power crushes Real Madrid | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","fields":{"bodyText":"It was at around 70 minutes, shortly after Toni Kroos had followed Luka Modric off the pitch, that the edges of the night began to sharpen a little and this Champions League semi-final took on a perfect clarity. Manchester City were going to win and Real Madrid were going to lose and no tweak or tactic, no switch or substitution, was going to change that fact. Real seemed to realise it too. Perhaps they were only 2-0 down but they were also bruised and broken, scarred and scared, tired of running into dead ends filled with blue shirts. Vinícius Junior had long since stopped trying to beat Kyle Walker and had instead resorted to dribbling past as many players as possible, like kids do in the playground. The fouls became more deliberate and more desperate. Even the Spanish radio commentators at the back of the press box had given up shouting and exhorting in favour of low, funereal voices and the odd illegible hand gesture. On the biggest stage, in their favourite competition, the most dominant club in Champions League history had been placed under intolerable levels of stress, and simply detonated. It finished four-nil, and perhaps that flattered Madrid a little. Ultimately only the flailing fingertips of Thibaut Courtois prevented this from becoming a total humiliation, the sort of scoreline that eventually earns a game its own Wikipedia page. It was probably City’s greatest performance under Pep Guardiola, a kind of footballing perfection, a museum piece, not merely a lesson but a scolding, sport as scorched earth strategy. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. What does remain? Certainly very little of this great Madrid side. Everyone knew this was a team in need of a transitional phase, a shift from the old to the new. Nobody expected it to happen in a single night. Modric – horrible performance – went off on 63 minutes. Kroos – not much better – departed a little later. Karim Benzema looked old. Will any of them ever play a game of this magnitude again? Maybe, but not together. At the point when Madrid most needed mobility and energy, they were left trying to press and disrupt the world’s best passing side with myth and aura alone. For once the numbers told much of the story. At the time City scored their first goal they had completed 196 passes to Madrid’s 30. It took 14 minutes for Rodrygo to have his first touch of the game. During the first half City had 196 touches in the final third; Madrid had 10. This wasn’t just dominance. There was a sadistic scorn to it too, the way City took their set-pieces as quickly as possible, the way Pep Guardiola threw a strop at every backward pass. City didn’t just beat Madrid, they barely acknowledged them. With the greatest of respect to Matteo Darmian and Edin Dzeko, it feels safe to assume that City will finally slake their Champions League thirst against Internazionale in Istanbul next month. They are so clearly the best team in the world at this point that it already feels a little passé, a little obvious, to say so. Nor should we imagine that City have only just started playing at this level. The last team to beat them over 180 minutes in this competition was Tottenham. On a long enough x-axis, City were always going to cross the winning post at some point. And so one of the world’s richest states spends years trying to hire the world’s greatest coach, succeeds, and then gives him literally everything he needs. Every other club in the world, with the exception of Paris Saint-Germain, has to operate within the constraints of finance or fortune. Every other club in the world has flaws or problem areas that they can’t address right now, but hope to at some point in the future. Guardiola, by contrast, gets the staff he wants, the players he wants when he wants them, gets their replacements ahead of schedule. So you don’t just sign Erling Haaland, you sign Julián Álvarez to give him a rest. Kalvin Phillips arrives for £45m, doesn’t play all season, and it’s fine. You decide – and just reflect on the breathtaking audacity of this for a second – that you need an upgrade on Phil Foden, and so up pops Jack Grealish. If someone accuses you of breaking the rules, you hire the world’s greatest lawyers to shoot them down. This is perfection, but not so much the perfection of great art as the perfection of a finely-executed military campaign, the perfection of unlimited wealth, the perfection of political strength, the perfection of a pointless mile-high crystal pyramid in the middle of the desert. No academy players and no Mancunians started for City last night. Does this matter? Does anything matter? Nobody should begrudge City fans their joy at this point. This has been their journey and their success as much as anyone else’s, and with a little perspective they may even realise that they are not as hated as they sometimes assume. Rather, the overwhelming sensation here for the neutral is indifference, a shrug at the inexorable inevitability of hard power. Everybody in this sport is tainted a little, and even on this unlevel playing field City fans have earned their moment of consummate triumph. By the same token, nobody else is obliged to feel anything about it whatsoever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-local-communities-jamie-driscoll-north-tyne-mayor","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T16:11:40Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says he wants to empower local communities.

All opposition leaders are localists until it matters. Keir Starmer said in January he wanted to “take back control” for local communities. The Labour leader wants them to have more say over jobs, transport, energy, climate change, housing, culture, childcare and finance. He wants to liberate what is now recognised as the most centralised state in Europe. So why, now, has the Labour leader decided that the people of the North of Tyne area will not be permitted to reselect their current mayor, Jamie Driscoll, to stand for Labour at the next election? Why did he agree in March that his predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, should not be reselected as MP for Islington North? Whatever the perceived misdeeds of these two politicians, surely these are matters for their respective communities to decide on. Come to that, I notice in the past few weeks that, despite his devolution speech, Starmer wants no devolution of power over council tax rises, local housing decisions or the siting of wind turbines, among other things. Nor will he tolerate any nonsense from Scottish people about “taking back control” of Scotland. He may want to move on “from slogans to solutions”, but whose solutions? Starmer, his advisers tell us, wants to show he is in charge. He wants to alter Labour’s chemistry, changing the party from a regional and ideological coalition that includes the left and the centre into a personal hegemony. He wants to cleanse it of any association with the eras of Ed Miliband or Jeremy Corbyn and restore the firm hand of Blairism. As Tony Blair saw off Militant and clause IV when he was party leader, so today Starmer is seeing off those with whom he disagrees by vetting candidates’ lists. Nothing in democratic politics is as wayward as the transition from opposition to power. The first requires making wild promises to an electorate, the second requires refashioning them in the harsh reality of high office. Starmer is right to see Blair’s leadership of Labour in the years 1995-97 as possibly the most successful example of a political opposition since the 1940s. He delivered a genuinely reformed Labour party, stripped of its old ideological baggage, “new” and fit for government. In power, Blair’s stance on localism was much the same as Starmer’s is now. He saw elected mayors as a way of sidestepping local Labour old guards and reviving democracy. But he allowed John Prescott to stall their modest introduction and Gordon Brown at the Treasury to limit their power. Blair then maintained Margaret Thatcher’s clampdown on local finance, in much the same way that David Cameron later took control of planning and housing targets. All power centralises, but when a constitution fails to protect local democracy, power centralises absolutely. Starmer’s January speech was certainly passionate. He promised a bill in his first term to instigate “a decade of national renewal”. He would “devolve sweeping powers to local communities” and grant a new “right to request powers” beyond even those he had listed. This was to be “no catchphrase interchange” but a recognition of the desire of communities “to stand on their own feet”. Those who have laboured long in this vineyard find such phrases desperately tired. Though Starmer was all for “communities” – a word that might imply Women’s Institutes, local fetes and Dad’s Army – he never mentioned local government or local councils, as if these were the bogey words of localism. In a democracy there should be no distinction between communities and democratic institutions, yet the Labour leader did not seem capable of admitting this. So could communities really regain control of their children’s education, as they did before Thatcher? Could they fix business rates and domestic taxes to meet their description of local need? Could they recover power over local development, so communities could decide how their area looked and changed? All these powers have passed from local councils to London in the past 30 years. Will Starmer really return them? In 2019 the Institute for Public Policy Research concluded its study of regional wealth across Europe. It found that Britain had the widest division between its capital and its regions of any comparable country. This disparity appeared in the amounts that people earned, the levels of economic productivity, the availability of local services – pretty much everything. A senior Treasury official admitted recently to the Institute for Government that this was probably “the most centralised government in the developed world”. It is two years since the all-party parliamentary group on devolution reported on lockdown. The report concluded that when lockdown decisions were delegated to devolved nations and local councils, they had proven “more flexible, effective and responsive” than those decided in Whitehall. The reason was simple: “the widest range of social and economic factors are often only visible to leaders rooted in the local community”. Big national challenges needed “place-based responses”. It apparently takes a parliamentary group to discover this. We might hope that Starmer got the point, and that he really does want to “stop power being hoarded by Westminster”. The trouble is that is what they all say, until they are doing the hoarding. Even before he finds himself in Downing Street, Starmer cannot bring himself to respect the local diversity that has long been Labour’s strength. He cannot allow his party to let the people of the north-east choose who it is they want to lead them. It is a very bad start.

A second “pillar” to the three-part deal covers the sharing of advanced military technologies, including quantum computing and artificial intelligence. New Zealand has not been offered the chance to join pillar one, nor would it accept, due to its anti-nuclear position. Little said any Aukus membership “could not compromise our legal obligations and our moral commitment to nuclear-free”. “[Aukus membership] would be about the kind of technology … needed to protect defence personnel,” he said. “Usually domain awareness, so surveillance technology, and radio technology that allows us to do that.” Little met this month with Kurt Campbell, the US national security coordinator for the Indo-Pacific region. During her visit to Beijing last week, Mahuta said, Chinese officials made clear their concerns. “They acknowledged our position on the matter. We’re not a part of those arrangements,” Mahuta said. New Zealand has other concerns about Aukus, including that it may jeopardise the treaty of Rarotonga, which designates large areas of the Pacific free of nuclear weapons. “Our concern is not to see the militarisation of the Pacific, that the treaty of Rarotonga be upheld, and that’s the basis upon which our assurances from Australia have been gained in relation to those arrangements,” Mahuta said. China is strongly against Aukus, with foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin outlining China’s “severe concern and firm opposition”. It is not clear whether China holds the same concerns regarding non-nuclear parts of Aukus. Last week, the New Zealand opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Gerry Brownlee, raised his own concerns about whether Aukus might make it harder for Anzac forces to operate together. On Tuesday, he walked back his comments, saying he was “certainly not” trying to criticise the deal. “Australia will make decisions for Australia,” Brownlee said. Little said foreign or local voices against the deal would not be a factor in potential membership. “We as a country and the leaders of the day have to make an assessment about our long-term best interests and what is a rapidly changing world and a rapidly changing region.” The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark has said it is not in New Zealand’s interests to be associated with Aukus.

It may not be entirely reassuring to learn, then, that a landmark global study has found that while the idea of generational divides is largely overblown, the so-called generation Z are evidently clear-eyed in their desire for power, achievement, hedonism and stimulation. Born between 1997 and 2012, gen Z is the largest generation in the world, with an annual purchasing power of $100bn globally. They will make up 27% of the global workforce by 2025 as they take over the reins of the world economy from millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), gen X (1965 to 1981), boomers (1946 to 1964) and the silent generation (1925 to 1945). No such age cohort is homogenous, and the differences between the generations were largely found to be comparatively small. However, the values driving gen Z are said to have stood out in a survey of 36,000 people in 30 countries, commissioned by the strategic communications consultancy BCW. When it comes to being very successful and people recognising their achievements, 44% of the age cohort said it was important to them. This compared with 37% of millennials who felt the same, 23% of gen X, 13% of boomers and 14% of the silent generation. A similar proportion (43%) of gen Z said it was “important to them to do things that can give them pleasure” and that they “seek every chance they can to have fun”. The proportion fell to 38% of the millennials and 27% of gen X. About a third (32%) of gen Z said it was important to be rich, compared with 26% of millennials and 16% of gen X. A similar ratio of gen Z said they wanted to have an exciting lifestyle – compared with 32% of millennials and 20% of gen X. Lisa Story, BCW’s chief strategy officer, said the increased focus on the individual evidenced by the results was a continuation of a trend that could be seen across the century and which had been potentially exacerbated by the rise of social media. She said: “If you look at the values [of gen Z] – power achievement, hedonism, stimulation – that’s a really interesting set because typically, people aren’t that comfortable with saying that they have those values. “So that is unusual. The fact that gen Z is largely living its life in a very public environment in which your social status [is public], the degree to which you’re successful, whether that is in a general lifestyle sense or whether it’s do with your work, I think that probably does create an environment where those values are very much more in play than they would have been without that technology and that platform.” The suggestion that those in gen Z are hedonistic might seem counterintuitive to some, with reports suggesting that British youngsters, for example, are eschewing alcohol. Story suggested that those in the younger age range may have a different understanding of pleasure than the older generations. She said: “The values are consistent, but they’re very different for different people in different environments. So, to be hedonistic, might be about … [for instance] going for a really good run and meeting friends for a juice at the end of it.” BCW’s report – Age of Values 2023, one of the largest studies of its kind – was based on Prof Shalom H Schwartz’s theory of basic universal values that serve as guiding principles for all human behaviour. The online survey took place between December 2022 and April 2023. The report suggests that people around the world remain above all else to be social animals “hard wired to cooperation with each other and avoid dispute or discord”. The top three values with which respondents indicated an allegiance were benevolence, universalism (the principle of tolerance for all) and security. Only a quarter of people said they strongly agreed that their governments’ policies and programmes aligned with their own values. Regionally, only 14% of people in southern Europe, 15% in northern Europe and 17% in the English-speaking world (Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US) believed they were in sync with their government. In the UK just 12% of people firmly believe that their government shares their values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","fields":{"bodyText":"It is 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed: Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he told the news agency. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. That is all for today. Thank you for reading along. We will be back bringing you the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed that a team of independent inspectors can travel to the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow’s forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant in south Ukraine not to disconnect the facility from the grid and potentially cut supplies to millions of Ukrainians. The United States Defence Department on Friday announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. “We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that’s what we’re doing with this package,” a senior US defence official told reporters. The official said Ukraine’s forces have made good use of the now 19 packages of arms the United States has provided since Moscow invaded on February 24. Swiss prosecutors have been asked by an Ukrainian NGO to investigate an alleged attack on a Swiss photojournalist by Russian troops in Ukraine earlier this year, AFP reported on Friday. The NGO Truth Hounds asked Switzerland’s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to probe an attack on Swiss freelance journalist Guillaume Briquet in southern Ukraine in March as a possible war crime, according to the Swiss-based Civitas Maxima group that helped it file the complaint. In a statement to AFP, the OAG confirmed that it had received the complaint and said it would “now be examined according to usual procedure”, stressing that a complaint did not automatically mean it would launch an investigation. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Kramatorsk, which is in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russia has submitted a letter to the United Nations Security Council warning of planned “provocations” by Ukraine at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a diplomat. The letter repeated Russia’s previous claim that Kyiv was planning a “provocation” at the plant on Friday, TASS reported. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia in March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. The plant has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. The United States is poised to announce it will provide Ukraine with nearly $800m (£678m) in new military aid on Friday, including at least a dozen surveillance drones, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press to discuss the aid ahead of its public release. They said the bulk of the aid package will be additional Howitzers (long-range weapons) and ammunition. Two officials confirmed the new inclusion of portable, long-endurance drones which are launched by a catapult and can be retrieved. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. France has now released a statement on Macron’s call with Putin. It says the French president “once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” and argued for the IAEA experts to attend the plant “as soon as possible”. Putin, the Élysée says, supported this idea. The statement continued: The two presidents will talk to each other again in the coming days on this subject, after discussions between the technical teams and before the deployment of the mission. Russian president Vladimir Putin and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have just finished a phone call about the situation in Ukraine, Moscow has said. In a Kremlin readout of the call, reported by Reuters, Putin said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which he blamed on Kyiv, created the risk of “large-scale catastrophe”. Reuters adds: Both presidents agree on the need to send a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the plant. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron about continuing obstacles to supplying Russian food and fertiliser products to world markets. The UN, Ukraine and western officials have all expressed concerns about Russia’s maintenance of the nuclear plant. The Kyiv Independent reports that it is the first time Macron and Putin have spoken since May. Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on Friday that it was taking punitive measures against a string of foreign IT companies, including TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. In a statement, Roskomnadzor said the measures were in response to the companies’ failure to remove content that it had flagged as illegal, and would remain in place until they complied. It did not specify what measures would be taken. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2m roubles (£28,635) and the messenger service Telegram 11m roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. On 29 July, the media watchdog targeted Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, and demanded that its website and print edition be stripped of its licence. Ukraine’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Friday. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. Western officials said on Friday they were concerned whether water cooling can be maintained at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently held by the Russians, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. The existing reactor cooling system, critical to the safety of the site, relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. One Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the issue we are concerned about is water cooling of the nuclear reactors” and that it was “a situation we should all be watching very closely”. But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site “able to operate and mitigate against this”. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost after an earthquake and a tsunami overwhelmed the back-up generators on site. The loss of cooling was enough to lead to a partial reactor meltdown. The western official said that fighting around the plant was considered a far lesser risk because nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impacts with thick walling. “They are built to be able to cope with a civilian airline crashing into them,” the official said, and added that “direct fires” such as artillery was “not our immediate concern”. But they would not comment on whether they believed Russia was deliberately staging forces at the site, or was preparing a false flag operation, other than to note that “both sides are contesting the information environment”. Social media videos appeare to show Russian forces basing themselves on the site. Olexander, a former worker at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station wrote an account of living in Enerhodar, a satellite city for the plant, for the Guardian. I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But they are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. Read the rest of the piece here: The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh reported on Friday that “significant efforts” are being made “to understand if Ukraine can mount a successful counter attack in the south”. Tweeting from a “western officials” briefing, Sabbagh added that “such attacks are not without risk”. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not to cut the nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so. “Obviously the electricity from Zaporizhzhia is Ukrainian electricity … This principle must be fully respected,” said the UN secretary general during a visit to the port of Odesa in southern Ukraine. The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeting live from a briefing on Friday, said the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. He added, from the briefing, that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “should be able to withstand most direct military fire. Built strong enough to resist impact of a civilian airliner. Concerns focused around whether the plant suffers a loss of cooling due to the loss of back-up electricity.” Concerns around shelling near the plant, the largest in Europe, have been growing since it was taken over by Russian forces in March. It is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. A former mayor of a Russian city has been appointed to head a Russian-installed government in north-east Ukraine, the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Andrei Alekseyenko resigned as mayor of Krasnodar on Thursday. He will now head a new Russian-appointed council of ministers in the Kharkiv province, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a decree by the local Russian-installed administration. Russian officials have previously said that occupied areas of Ukraine will never return to Kyiv’s control, and that referendums on their accession to Russia may be held in the autumn. Ukraine has called them “pseudo-referendums” and vowed to prevent them. Italian newspapers have issued front-page warnings of alleged Russian interference in the upcoming election on Friday. This comes as a response to comments from Russia’s former president urging Europeans to “punish” their “stupid” governments, AFP reports. The former president and current deputy chair of Russia’s security council, Dmitry Medvedev, on Thursday called for Europeans to be “not only outraged at the actions of their governments ... but to hold them to account and punish them for their obvious stupidity”. “Act, European neighbours! Don’t remain silent! Demand accountability!” he said on Telegram. Following Medvedev’s comments, la Repubblica and il Messaggero front pages on Friday wrote of Russian “interference”, while the Corriere della Sera said Russia was “agitating” political waters ahead of the vote due to be held on 25 September. Rishi Sunak has called on the G20 to bar the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from its summit until Moscow halts the war in Ukraine, his spokesperson told Reuters on Friday. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are said to be attending G20, which will be held on the island of Bali in November, according to earlier reports from Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. “Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep,” a spokesperson for the former chancellor told Reuters. They added: “We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine.” Sunak is currently trailing behind the foreign secretary, Liz Truss , in polls in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. In a televised debate on 25 July, Truss said it would be important to confront Putin in front of Russia’s allies. She said:, “I would go there, and I would call Putin out.” As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It’s 11am in the UK and 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything that’s happened so far today: The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases, after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. According to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reports. There were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”, a report by the Institute for the Study of War, has found. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in the Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The head of Kharkiv Oblast police, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said there are currently 19 people confirmed dead, including a child, and 20 injured, with the death toll expected to rise after Russian rockets struck two hostel dormitories. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. The summit, initiated by Ukraine, will be available to watch live on Nato’s website. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Russians have realised that Crimea is “not a place for them” and hinted more attacks could lie ahead. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. According to the Kyiv Independent, Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to the head of the Russian occupation government in Ukraine’s Crimea, posted on the social media app Telegram that the Russian military had destroyed a target in the city of Kerch, which is linked to Russia’s Krasnodar Krai via the strategic Crimean Bridge. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office, said on 17 August that the Crimean Bridge should be destroyed. The Kyiv Independent reports that according to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats. A new report from the The Institute for the Study of War, a non-profit research organisation in the US has found there were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as the chief of Russia’s radiation, chemical and biological defence forces, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, claimed on 18 August in a briefing that “Ukrainian forces are preparing for a provocation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the provocation is meant to coincide with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres’s visit to Ukraine”. It is 9am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov said a residential building was damaged and another building caught fire. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting about 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Multiple rocket launchers and generally inaccurate area weapons have caused devastation across large parts of the city. Russian forces continue to conduct local raids and probing attacks against Ukrainian forces, the ministry added. They are probably trying to force Ukraine to maintain significant forces on this front, to prevent them from being employed as a counter-attack force elsewhere.” Studying in Kryvyi Rih in the 1990s, Ukraine’s wartime leader often skipped class to focus on his standup, our correspondent Luke Harding reports from Zelenskiy’s hometown. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,” Andrii Shaikan, rector of the state university in Zelenskiy’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, said. Read the full story below. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Indonesia is chairing the Group of 20 major economies and has faced pressure from Western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin over his country’s invasion on Ukraine, which his government calls a “special military operation”. Jokowi has sought to position himself as mediator between the warring countries, and has travelled to meet both Ukraine’s and Russia’s presidents. This week, Jokowi said both countries have accepted Indonesia as a “bridge of peace”. Leaders of major countries, including US president Joe Biden, are set to meet in Indonesia’s resort island of Bali in November. Indonesia has also invited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Guardian correspondent Luke Harding came upon a mural of outgoing UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, while reporting in the southern Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, the home town of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The design – created by a collective from Odesa – shows a mop-haired Johnson giving a thumbs up. The mural’s artist, Anastasia Scherba, said she was grateful to Johnson for supporting Ukraine and giving it weapons. “He’s cool,” she said Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent newspaper cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov reported that Kharkiv’s Kyivskyi, Osnovyanskyi, and Nemyshlianskyi districts were affected. A residential building was damaged and another unspecified building caught fire as a result of the shelling. One person has been reported injured so far. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to have hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. “As of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv … and 42 people have been injured,” Synehubov said, describing the attacks as “an act of terrorism”. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. At least four explosions hit near the major Belbek airbase, north of Sevastopol in the occupied Crimean peninsula. The pro-Russia governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said: “There is no damage. No one was hurt.” Air defences were also activated near Kerch, the city at the Crimean end of a bridge to mainland Russia, which is a strategically vital supply route that many in Ukraine would like to see destroyed. Local media said a Ukrainian drone was shot down. Amid fears that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, world leaders have called to urgently secure the site. The UN secretary general called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added: We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl.” Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant they control. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN secretary general’s visit to Ukraine, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When António Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. Jeremy Fleming, the intelligence head, said both countries have been using their cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine. In an op-ed in The Economist on Friday, he wrote: So far, president Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west. Although that’s cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world. Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The country’s use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.” Fleming said Russia had deployed WhisperGate malware to destroy and deface Ukrainian government systems. He also said Russia has used the same playbook before on Syria and the Balkans and said online disinformation is a major part of Russia’s strategy. However, the GCHQ has been able to intercept and to provide warnings in time, he said. Without going into much detail, Fleming said the UK’s National Cyber Force could respond to Russia by deploying a UK military unit that employs offensive cyber tools.

Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. The Russian military announced that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy took over a major news conference after becoming irked by a interpreter’s failure to translate his comments properly into English. Zelenskiy acted after the interpreter cut short his remarks during an event with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and United Nations secretary general António Guterres. Zelenskiy confirmed that Ukraine has not changed its position on peace negotiations, saying talks with Russia are only possible if Russian forces leave illegally occupied territory in Ukraine. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russians, its government said. Estonia’s foreign minister also defended his country’s decision to bar Russian tourists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T11:15:43Z","webTitle":"UK arm of EDF returns to profit as household electricity prices soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK arm of the French energy company EDF bounced back to profit last year, making more than £1bn, as it was boosted by the rising cost of wholesale energy, which allowed it to sell the electricity it generated at a higher price. The firm made a pre-tax profit of £1.1bn in the UK last year, before one-off items, a recovery from a loss of £21m a year earlier. EDF, which runs Britain’s nuclear power stations, said the profit was related to stronger operational performance of its nuclear fleet, and higher energy prices. The company is building Britain’s newest nuclear reactor, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which has been hit by delays and climbing costs. The cost of the project was originally set at £18bn, before it was later put at £25bn to £26bn. On Friday, EDF said that £25bn to £26bn remained the estimated cost based on 2015 calculations but “the estimated nominal cost at completion could reach £32.7bn” because of inflation. The company, which is mostly state-owned but is being fully nationalised in France, is the UK’s fourth-largest energy supplier, providing gas and electricity to more than 5m UK households. EDF said Britain’s cap on energy bills hit earnings at its energy supply business, which made a loss of £200m. The company said this was because it cost it more to buy energy to supply to its residential customers than the price it was allowed to charge them under the energy price cap. The UK profit was a rare bright spot for EDF in its annual results, which reported a record net loss of €17.9bn (£16bn) for the whole group in 2022, as its nuclear output plunged to a 34-year low after a record number of outages at its reactors in France. Stress corrosion cracks were found in pipes in the cooling systems of some reactors. The group’s net debt rose to almost €65bn last year, up from €43bn a year earlier. EDF’s chief executive, Luc Rémont, who was appointed by the French government last November to turn the company around, said: “Today, our priority is to put EDF back on track.” EDF said it invested £2.6bn in the UK in 2022 in its nuclear, renewables and customer businesses. The company said it was investing more than £13bn in the UK between 2023 and 2025, largely in the Hinkley Point scheme. It is also planning to invest about £2bn in its existing nuclear fleet and renewables projects this year. It welcomed the UK government’s decision last November confirming that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk would go ahead, and which will be developed by EDF. The government has taken a 50% stake in the project, which will be the second of a new generation of UK nuclear power reactors, after Hinkley Point C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Did Vietnam peace protests stop Nixon using nuclear weapons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","fields":{"bodyText":"A new documentary about demonstrations against the Vietnam war in late 1969 argues that the hundreds of thousands who filled the streets in Washington and almost every major US city convinced Richard Nixon to abandon a plan to sharply escalate the war, including the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons. The Movement and The “Madman” will air on PBS on Tuesday. Produced and directed by the veteran documentarian Stephen Talbot, it evokes a peak moment of 1960s activism – and the “absolute disconnection” between what Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, were “deciding to do and the human costs of it, whether it’s to our own soldiers or [Vietnamese] civilians”. Those costs “had absolutely no part of their thinking” said the historian Carolyn Eisenberg. “They don’t care.” Talbot’s sure eye for searing images is matched by a perfect ear for songs. His soundtrack includes anti-establishment hymns by Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Jimi Hendrix and Judy Collins, plus the essential anti-war anthem, I-Feel-Like-I’m Fixin’-to-Die Rag, which became world famous after Country Joe McDonald performed it at Woodstock in summer 1969. The one thing the documentary does not do is provide any convincing evidence that the demonstrations prevented the use of nuclear weapons. “It is a serious look at how one major demonstration was organized,” said Thomas Powers, author of The War at Home, a history of the anti-war movement; The Man Who Kept the Secrets, a widely admired biography of the former CIA director Richard Helms; and seven other books. But as far as the idea that “a real danger of the use of atomic weapons was prevented [by the Vietnam Moratorium] – I think that’s just plain wrong”, Powers told the Guardian. Talbot responded that declassified documents about Operation Duck Hook, which laid out options for Nixon, included the possible use of nuclear weapons as well as the mining of Haiphong harbor and the bombing of dykes that would have caused massive civilian casualties. As to whether Nixon seriously considered the nuclear option, Talbot said: “I literally don’t know and I don’t think anyone could say for sure. But it was on the table.” The “madman” of Talbot’s film is Nixon. One thing that is not in dispute is that the president worked hard to convince the North Vietnamese and the Russians he was crazy enough to do anything, including pulling the nuclear trigger, if Hanoi refused his demands to withdraw from the south. As Stephen Bull, a former Nixon aide, explains in the film, his boss wanted the Russians to “think that he was a madman. However, my personal observation was, it was a bluff. He was never going to use nuclear weapons, but he wanted the threat to be out there to force them to the table.” Powers likened Nixon’s threats to use nuclear bombs to Vladimir Putin’s current threats to use such weapons against Ukraine – which Powers doesn’t think are serious either. Talbot agreed that was a possibility. In his memoirs, Nixon wrote: “Although publicly I continued to ignore the raging anti-war controversy, I had to face the fact that it had probably destroyed the credibility of my ultimatum to Hanoi.” The other thing the demonstrations almost certainly accomplished was the passage of a law, signed by Nixon in November 1969, which created a draft lottery. On 1 December 1969, every draft-eligible young man born between 1944 and 1950 was assigned a number based on his birth date, from one to 365. The following year, the Pentagon announced that no one with a number higher than 195 would be drafted. A year later that number dropped to 125, then to 95 the year after that. Since everyone in the streets in 1969 was demonstrating in no small part because of an acute desire to avoid dying in what they considered a pointless conflict, the lottery had an immediate effect in reducing the number who felt a sense of urgency about the war. If you had a high enough number, your life was no longer in danger. After the very first lottery, more than a third of those previously subject to the draft no longer felt any imminent jeopardy. So there was less self-interest to propel the anti-war protests. Talbot agreed that the lottery was a direct result of the anti-war demonstrations, and said he included it in an earlier, longer version of his film – but it did not make the final cut. In fall 1969, he was a senior in college. He went to DC to make his first film, March on Washington, which became his senior thesis when he attended Wesleyan University. “I used clips from my first student film for this documentary,” he told the Guardian. The truth is, while the Vietnam demonstrations did reduce the dangers of the draft, there is almost no evidence they shortened the war. When Nixon took office, 31,000 Americans had been killed in Vietnam, plus hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. By the time the last American combat troops left in March 1973, two months after the draft was abolished, 58,220 US soldiers had died – plus as many as 2 million Vietnamese civilians and 1.3 million Vietnamese soldiers.

The war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan will dominate G7 discussions this week, but the host, Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, is expected to carve out time to push for a pledge on nuclear weapons when leaders meet in Hiroshima, the first place on Earth targeted by an atomic bomb. The leaders began to arrive on Thursday, before an expected visit on Saturday to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, which contains exhibits showing the scale of the tragedy that unfolded after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people by the end of the year. Kishida, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other G7 leaders are expected to see displays including a simulation that reproduces the wave of destruction that followed the bombing, with the human cost represented by mundane items such as ripped school uniforms, the blackened contents of a bento lunchbox, and a tricycle whose three-year-old owner would die within 24 hours. The need to reference the dangers of nuclear weapons has intensified since Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima in 2016. Vladimir Putin has refused to publicly rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, while North Korea continues to develop more sophisticated missiles theoretically capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US mainland. What has Kishida said in the run-up to the summit? He spoke of his desire for “a world without nuclear weapons”, although campaigners point to the failure by Japan – part of the US nuclear umbrella – to sign a 2021 UN treaty banning the possession and use of nuclear weapons. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said of the planned group visit to the peace museum. Biden ‘confident’ of reaching deal with McCarthy to avoid US debt default Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said yesterday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach. Speaking at the White House, Biden said: “I’m confident that we’ll get the agreement on the budget, that America will not default. We’re going to come together because there’s no alternative way to do the right thing for the country. We have to move on.” On Tuesday, Biden and McCarthy met for an hour at the White House, a meeting the president called productive. Biden, who has faced some criticism for his handling of the issue, is due to travel to the G7 summit in Japan but has cut the trip short to pursue a debt ceiling deal. Plans to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia were postponed. A failure to honour US debts could have catastrophic effects on the US and world economies. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has indicated that without agreement default could come as early as 1 June. Republicans want sharp spending cuts. Democrats say Republicans should agree to a “clean” debt bill, the sort they repeatedly passed under Donald Trump. But Biden also seemed ready to make compromises, including some work requirements on federal programs, though not on healthcare. What has Biden said in response to the criticism? The president said: “I’ll be in constant contact with my team while I’m at the G7 and be in close touch with speaker McCarthy and other leaders as well. What I have done in anticipation that we won’t get it all done till I get back is, I’ve cut my trip short in order to be [here] for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader.” What has McCarthy said? Speaking to CNBC, he said: “I think at the end of the day we do not have a debt default. The thing I’m confident about is now we have a structure to find a way to come to a conclusion. The timeline is very tight. But we’re going to make sure we’re in the room and get this done.” Nike may have misclassified workers and could face more than $530m in tax fines Nike may have misclassified thousands of temporary office workers and faces potential tax fines of more than $530m, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The sporting goods company employs more than 79,000 people worldwide and, like many large corporations, relies on an army of independent contractors to do much of the work, including business consulting, T-shirt graphics, photography and event planning. According to independent reports compiled for the company and given to the Guardian, Nike management’s handling of independent contractors has left it open to potentially huge fines from tax authorities and the possibility of class-action lawsuits. The US, UK and other countries have strict rules about the use of independent contractors, meant to protect workers’ rights and ensure fair tax collection. The Biden administration last year indicated it intends to crack down on companies that infringe them. Where does the $530m figure come from? A July 2022 review of Nike’s independent contractors in the US, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the company faces a “misclassification risk” of more than $530m. The report, compiled by People2.0, a workforce services specialist, looked at 3,670 entities – independent contractors, law firms, individuals and others – in the US who had been paid more than $7.2bn over three years. It found that a quarter of those contractors may have been incorrectly classified. What has Nike said? The company did not return calls and emails for comment. In other news … Jack Teixeira, the US air national guard member charged with being behind the Pentagon leaks of highly classified military documents, was warned repeatedly over his mishandling of classified material, according to a court filing. Justice department lawyers made the disclosure in court papers that urged Teixeira be kept behind bars while he awaits trial. Westpac has banned customers from transferring funds to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, in a move aimed at reducing losses from scams. The Australian big four bank said today it was blocking a number of cryptocurrency exchanges as part of a trial. Republicans successfully sidestepped an effort to force them into a vote to expel George Santos, the New York representative, from Congress, which could have narrowed their already slim four-seat majority. The House voted along party lines, 221-204, to refer a resolution to expel the congressman to the House ethics committee. Montana has became the first US state to ban TikTok after the governor signed legislation prohibiting mobile application stores from offering the app within the state by next year. The move is among the most dramatic in a series of US escalations against TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Stat of the day: top five US executives hoard $9bn tax-free for retirement as workers face limits The top five executives at the US’s largest companies have amassed close to $9bn in tax-free retirement saving accounts while many of their employees have struggled to set aside any funds for retirement, according to a report released today. The report, A Tale of Two Retirements, from the Institute for Policy Studies and Jobs With Justice, found the top five executives at S&amp;P 500 firms held a combined $8.9bn in special tax-deferred accounts at the end of 2021. Income taxes will be due on this compensation when they withdraw the funds, but in the meantime they benefit from the tax-free compounding of investment returns. These “top hat” plans allow unlimited tax-deferred retirement while ordinary workers face strict limits on their 401(k) retirement plan contributions. Don’t miss this: the best childcare in the world? Maybe so, but new parents in Iceland are holding out for better In a bright, bunting-filled community hall in central Reykjavik, 30 parents are attending a council-funded playgroup. Half of them are fathers – not unusual in a country considered to have one of the best childcare policies in the world. As well as six months’ leave for both parents at 80% of pay – with six weeks extra to share between them – childcare is heavily subsidised by the government. Yet parents and policymakers are pushing for more. Iceland spends 1.7% of its gross domestic product on early childhood education and care – more than double that of most other countries. That leaves Icelandic families spending only about 5% of their income on childcare. Despite this, parents at the Thursday playgroup, run by an organisation called Memmm, are pushing for more change. Parents explain why. … or this: the fall of Rudy Giuliani, once the toast of New York, continues unabated From “America’s mayor” to a human punchline, Rudy Giuliani’s descent continues unabated, writes Lloyd Green. On Monday, news broke of the septuagenarian being slammed with a $10m sexual harassment and unpaid wages lawsuit brought by Noelle Dunphy, 43, a former aide. The mighty have fallen. Once Giuliani was the toast of town. As a federal prosecutor he sent a congressman to jail, locked up mobsters and indicted white-collar criminals. As mayor, he made the streets feel safe again. Love him or hate him, crime precipitously dropped on his watch. In the days and months following 9/11, he projected strength, confidence and reassurance. He had braced himself for a calamity; he just didn’t know its source or when it would happen. He was steady when crunch time arrived. These days, Giuliani and the words “defendant” and “buffoon” stand adjacent. Man sues Giuliani over false arrest after ‘pat’ on back led to assault charge Climate check: world likely to breach 1.5C climate threshold by 2027, scientists warn The world is almost certain to experience new record temperatures in the next five years and temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have warned. The breaching of the crucial 1.5C threshold, which scientists have said could have dire consequences, should be only temporary, according to research from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, it would represent a marked acceleration of human impacts on the global climate system and send the world into “uncharted territory”, the UN agency warned. Countries have pledged, under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to try to hold global temperatures to no higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after scientific advice that heating beyond that level would unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts. Last Thing: blues singer gets high school diploma decades after being expelled for his hair The US blues musician Otis Taylor, whose critically revered song Ten Million Slaves has been featured on major films and television shows, has at the age of 74 received his diploma from the high school that expelled him decades ago because of his hairstyle. Taylor was studying at Manual high school in Denver in 1966 when he drew unwanted attention from administrators because of his long hair and was kicked out. Since then, laws have been passed that prohibit discrimination against students over their hairstyle. More recently, Denver’s public school district “wanted to right [the] wrong” inflicted on the music star as a teenager, according to a CBS report. Officials invited him to a ceremony this week in which they presented him with an honorary diploma symbolizing the one he would have received if the modern rules were in effect at the time he was a student at Manual.

Power grids are preparing to be put under strain as demand for airconditioning soars in mega-cities such as Shanghai. Demand for electricity in southern manufacturing hubs, including Guangdong, has surged in recent days, with China Southern Power Grid, one of the country’s two grid operators, seeing peak power load exceeding 200m kilowatts – weeks earlier than normal and close to historical highs. The sweltering heat comes amid a year of rising temperatures and erratic weather in China. In February, the China Meteorological Administration warned that “extreme weather and climate events are still showing a high incidence and intensity [for the year]”. In March, temperatures in Wuhan and Zhengzhou, cities in central China, were more than 10 degrees higher than normal for that time of year. Unusually for China, 2023 has seen the arid north of the country hotter than the south, a pattern that is thought to be causing a range of ecological problems. Since last summer, the Yangtze river basin has experienced the worst drought since 1961, hurting local grain harvests. Chinese government statistics show that since July last year, rainfall in the Yangtze river basin has declined by nearly 50%. The water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river, Poyang and Dongting Lakes, which are the largest and the second-largest freshwater lakes in China, are the lowest in history for the same period. Yunnan province in south-west China has also been experiencing a drought since the beginning of this year, with average down 60% compared with the same period in 2022, and the average temperature up 0.8 degrees., according to government agencies. Nearly a million people in the province are suffering from drought, with nearly 200,000 needing some kind of assistance from the government.

As the heavy early morning rain began to ease, the summit’s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko, welcomed leaders and their spouses at the entrance to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, where they viewed graphic reminders of the attack on the city on 6 August 1945 and its gruesome aftermath. The Japanese leader – whose wife wore a gold pin shaped like an origami crane, a symbol of the city’s nuclear legacy – has said that achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is his “life’s work”. Joe Biden became the second sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, after Barack Obama in 2016, while Rishi Sunak is the first British prime minister to visit the site of the world’s first nuclear attack. An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly, but by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to 140,000 as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. Media were barred from the museum for the length of the visit – amid speculation over whether the leaders would visit only the building’s east wing, which describes the dangers of nuclear war, or also pass through the main building, which contains photos of victims with horrific injuries. The group emerged from the museum after about 30 minutes and, led by Kishida and Biden, made the short walk to a cenotaph honouring the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the atomic bombing almost eight decades ago. Together, the leaders stepped forward to lay wreaths – given to them by local schoolchildren – on podiums in front of the memorial, with its eternal flame and plaque that reads: “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.” The burned-out shell of the A-bomb Dome, one of the few buildings to have survived the attack, could be seen in the distance. After a moment of silence, there was a group ceremony to plant a cherry blossom sapling, propagated from a tree that survived the atomic blast. The leaders later met a hibakusha survivor of the bombing. On a morning steeped in symbolism, this was the first time the leaders of G7 countries – including three that possess nuclear weapons – had visited the museum together. US officials said Biden, in a repeat of the approach taken by Obama, did not plan to issue an apology – a move that would go down badly in the US, where the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and, three days later, Nagasaki are seen as bringing the Pacific war to a quick end. But he and the other leaders viewed some of the museum’s harrowing exhibits, which included burned and ripped clothes, the charred contents of a child’s lunch box and strands of human hair from people who suffered exposure to radiation. Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, said agreements on the need to realise a world without nuclear weapons were among his goals during the three-day summit, which is expected to be dominated by the war in Ukraine and China’s growing military and economic might. “We will once again confirm our resolve to work for a world without nuclear weapons and we hope to transmit to the world our strong determination to protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law,” Kishida told reporters as he left for Hiroshima. “I hope that here in Hiroshima, the G7 and leaders from elsewhere will show their commitment to peace, which will be remembered in history.” In keeping with Kishida’s desire to place nuclear weapons high on the agenda, the summits final communique is expected to criticise Russia for threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Obama, who won the Nobel peace prize for his vision of a world without nuclear weapons, gave a speech at the peace park in 2016 and embraced a hibakusha survivor of the atomic bombing. But he spent only 10 minutes in the museum’s lobby, where he was shown a small number of symbolic exhibits. Kishida has tried to move nuclear disarmament up the agenda for this year’s summit and reportedly insisted G7 leaders visit not only peace memorials but also the museum. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” he said ahead of the visit to the peace museum. There is little enthusiasm for reducing nuclear stockpiles, however, at a time when Russia has issued thinly veiled threats to use them against Ukraine, and while North Korea is raising fears of a new nuclear test after a series of long-range missile launches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T17:15:30Z","webTitle":"We need more honesty on nuclear power’s long legacy of hazardous waste | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","fields":{"bodyText":"Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (The long read, 15 December). As Britain and other states with nuclear power industries grapple with how to go about an effective, safe and economical nuclear clean-up, it might be better to explain the challenges with less reliance on suggestions that in its early days the nuclear industry never thought about decommissioning (though the point has validity). Instead, we need more honesty about the fact that nuclear power inescapably generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste, the worst of which will remain hazardous probably beyond Homo sapiens’ time on the planet. The industry’s solution to this is a network of deep disposal facilities. But none have yet been created, their cost is enormous and there is no certainty that they will perform the long-term task required of them. These are considerations that sadly receive little attention in current debates about the need for new nuclear-generation capacity. Coincidentally, you published a letter (14 December) suggesting that nuclear radiation is less dangerous than emissions from a wood-burning stove, a curious comparison to make. Wood-burning stoves are pollutants, no question, but they could never lead to a Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chornobyl or Fukushima. Nor will decommissioning them cost billions and take decades. Tom Smith Chair, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, 2017-20 • In 1993, a government official told me that “it was sometimes right to do the wrong thing”. For reasons of political expediency, it was right to give political consent for the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. This huge facility, not mentioned in Samanth Subramanian’s fine long read, had been built over the previous decade to reprocess British and foreign, especially Japanese, spent nuclear fuels. Abandoning it would be too embarrassing for the many politicians and their parties that had backed it, expensive in terms of compensation for broken contracts, and damaging to Britain’s and the nuclear industry’s international reputation. It was wrong to proceed, as the government well knew, because the primary justification for its construction – supply of plutonium for fast breeder reactors (FBRs) – had been swept away by the abandonment of FBRs in the 1980s (none were built anywhere). Because returning Thorp’s separated plutonium and radwaste to Japan would be difficult and risky. Because decommissioning Thorp would become much more costly after its radioactive contamination. Because there was a known win-win solution, favoured by most utilities – store the spent fuel safely at Sellafield prior to its return to senders, avoiding the many troubles that lay ahead. Thorp operated fitfully until its closure in 2018. The 30 tonnes of plutonium that it separated remains at Sellafield – another waste to trouble generations to come. William Walker Edinburgh • Anton van der Merwe makes the compelling point that lack of investment in nuclear power over the last 40 years has had a disastrous impact on carbon emissions and therefore has exacerbated the climate emergency (Letters, 14 December). However, in the same issue, the long read discusses plans for new nuclear without mentioning the huge beneficial impact that low-carbon nuclear will need to have if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C temperature rises published in 2018 presented mitigation scenarios in which nuclear generation would grow on average 2.5 times from today’s level by 2050. Without this, the chances of meeting climate targets are much reduced. Neil Smith Solihull, West Midlands • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as “very dangerous” and very unstable. He said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, adding that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first Brotosj Challenger 2 main battle tanks have arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, the country’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of “aggression” against Ukraine, officials said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, “in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. Belarus’s foreign ministry has justified its decision to allow Russia to station nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Minsk had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security, it said, according to Russian news agency Tass. Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki added. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight and that his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision is “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. The US has not seen any indications that Russia is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby has said. It comes after Vladimir Putin announced on Saturday that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Speaking to reporters today, Kirby said: We’re watching this as best we can. We haven’t seen any movement by Mr Putin to act on what he pledged he would do. The Belarusian foreign ministry today confirmed it will host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Donetsk regional police have published footage showing scenes of devastation in Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka. The video shows destroyed residential blocks with charred walls and piles of rubble on deserted streets as police continue to evacuate civilians. Starting on Sunday, the city will begin to shut off its utilities as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, its military administration head. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of “aggression” against Ukraine, officials said. A US state department spokesperson said: We believe that this Special Tribunal should be rooted in Ukraine’s domestic judicial system, as this will provide the clearest path to establishing a new Tribunal and maximize our chances of achieving meaningful accountability. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak also announced Washington’s support for such a court in a speech on Monday night. She said: At this critical moment in history, I am pleased to announce that the United States supports the development of an internationalised tribunal dedicated to prosecuting the crime of aggression against Ukraine. She said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, \"in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation,” has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. Here’s some reaction to the IOC’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to compete under a neutral flag in international sporting events. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision is “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”, posting to Twitter: I would have liked the Russian and Belarusian athletes to remain excluded. There is no reason whatsoever for Russia to return to world sport. Wladimir Klitschko, the Ukrainian former professional boxer, accused IOC president Thomas Bach of serving “the colours and interests of Russia”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, said it was “a day of shame for the IOC”, posting to Twitter: What positive things has Russia done for their athletes to now take part in competitions!! After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel!! After the daily bombings of civilian sites!! A 200-year-old bronze statue commemorating Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is to be surrounded by thousands of sandbags to echo the plight of monuments in Ukraine. The plan for Liverpool’s Nelson’s Monument is one of 24 cultural commissions announced on Tuesday as part of a festival that aims to transform the city in the run-up to its staging of the Eurovision song contest. Running from 1-14 May, it will, say the organisers, be “the pre-party to end all pre-parties” as fans from across the world descend on the city. Claire McColgan, the director of Culture Liverpool, said the planned EuroFestival would be a “scouse/Ukrainian mashup of brilliance”. She added: No other Eurovision host city has ever curated a creative programme of such scale and scope. This is the spirit of Eurovision spilling on to our streets. Free for all. Accessible to all. Uniting us all. Read the full story here: The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. The IOC issued a set of recommendations, which stated that those “with a Russian or a Belarusian passport must compete only as Individual Neutral Athletes”, meaning individuals can compete without national symbols, such as a flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. It added that “athletes who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies” could also not be considered. IOC president Thomas Bach, speaking at a news conference today, said: What is maybe most important, what has changed, is that participation of athletes with Russian and Belarusian passports in competitions and in international competitions, works. The US will not provide Russia with data on its nuclear forces, the White House has said, following Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend Moscow’s participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty. The 2010 agreement, which limited the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy, was the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia. Putin announced its suspension in February, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Moscow in Ukraine. A spokesperson for the US national security council said today: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start Treaty by taking proportionate and reversable countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. They added: That means that because Russia’s claimed suspension of the New Start Treaty is legally invalid, the US is legally permitted to withhold our biannual data update in response to Russia’s breaches. The US has previously said Moscow’s decision to suspend its participation in the treaty showed it was not a responsible nuclear partner. Russia and the US together hold 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as “very dangerous” and very unstable. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi, who yesterday met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station, northeast of the Zaporizhzhia plant, said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. He was speaking a day before he is expected to travel to the nuclear plant, the largest in Europe. Grossi has been pushing for a safety zone to be created at the plant to prevent a possible nuclear disaster as Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site of the power station. Kyiv does not want a deal that will in effect recognise or allow a Russian military presence at the plant. Grossi added: I am confident that it might be possible to establish some form of protection, perhaps not emphasising so much the idea of a zone, but on the protection itself: what people should do, or shouldn’t do to protect (the plant) instead of having a territorial concept. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official.

It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. Higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka “potentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the area”, according to the Institute for Study of War (ISW). The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help “explain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past week”. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Sloviansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022.

It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Earlier we reported that a Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine had reportedly been sentenced to two years in prison. It appears that the whereabouts of the convicted man, Alexei Moskalyov, is unclear. Court officials have said the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight, and was not present for the outcome of his trial. He had been wearing a bracelet that tracked his movements but apparently had taken it off. Moskalyov’s lawyer, Vladimir Biliyenko, told reporters after the hearing today that he learned of his client’s disappearance at the court hearing. He said he had not seen his client since Monday and did not know whether Moskalyov had fled. He told Reuters: At the moment, to be honest, I’m in a state of shock. He said the defence would appeal against the court’s verdict and that Moskalyov’s daughter, Maria, would remain in a state-run shelter for the time being. While the panel discussion continues in Washington DC, where France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna , and the Czech Republic’s foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, have also spoken, Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was due to appear, has posted to Telegram. He has said he has visited Sumy, posting: Sumy region. Our border. [I] observed the service of the border guards holding the frontiers of the state. Ukrainian border guards work in close cooperation with other components of the defence forces of Ukraine to protect the state border from the enemy. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has been addressing a summit on democracy in Washington DC, and has been outlining again Ukraine’s peace plan. The key points he has made so far include saying: Although Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine, its aggression is not only about Ukraine. Russia also aims to destroy the world order based on international law and the UN Charter. Our sons and daughters have not only been fighting for the future, but also defending our common democratic values at the cost of their lives. In this fight, we are defending the entire democratic world. No other nation wants peace more than Ukraine. But peace at any cost is an illusion. I would like to emphasise that the Ukrainian people will accept peace only if it guarantees the cessation of Russian aggression in full the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of our state’s territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders. He went on to say later: “I want to be clear, Russia has to withdraw from every square metre of Ukrainian territory. There should be no misinterpretation of what the word withdrawal implies.” Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, responded by saying that calls for a ceasefire were appealing – “who wouldn’t want the guns to be silent” – but risked freezing the conflict and allowing Russia to consolidate its territorial gains at Ukraine’s expense. In his opening address in Washington DC, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken has restated the US position on potential future peace in Ukraine. He said: The US is committed to supporting meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve this. We all know that for peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and for peace to be durable. It must ensure that Russia can’t simply rest and refit its troops, and then relaunch the war at a time more advantageous to it. Ukraine under president Zelenskiy has put forward a proposal that would force such a peace. It would end the war and save countless lives. It would restore Ukraine’s territory, and respect its democracy, would reconstruct the country and the economy. It would ensure that radiation and nuclear safety. It would uphold the UN Charter and the will of the international community. And it would come to the aid of billions around the world that have been affected by Russia’s aggression. There’s been a change of plan at the summit, and Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has appeared, carrying Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s apologies, saying that you will have seen in the news that Ukraine’s president is visiting frontline regions in Ukraine. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken is chairing an event entitled “A Just and Lasting Peace in Ukraine”, and the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to join the event virtually. It is part of a summit for democracy event being held in Washington DC. You will be able to watch a live stream on this blog. You may need to refresh the page for the play button to appear. The session is just starting. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. The Belarusian foreign ministry justified its decision to cooperate with Russia in a statement today, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Morawiecki, at a news conference in Bucharest, said: This step taken by Russia... the announcement of the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus, will certainly lead to the announcement of additional sanctions, the level of sanctions will be much more severe for the Lukashenko regime. The US has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”. Aa senior Biden administration official has said there were no signs Moscow planned to use its nuclear weapons. Morawiecki said he was in daily talks with other EU leaders about an 11th package of sanctions against Russia and that it would include more measures targeting Belarus. In February, Poland announced it would close a key border crossing with Belarus amid rising tensions after a journalist of Polish origin was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Belarusian court in a trial Warsaw says was politically motivated. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki said today. He added: We border Belarus and, as part of our bilateral relations, we are considering tightening the parameters of passenger and freight traffic in order to send a signal that we do not accept actions that serve Russia in its aggressive actions in Ukraine. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was convicted on Tuesday of discrediting the armed forces, the OVD-Info rights group said. He has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Moskalyov was convicted over comments he had posted online about the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. But the investigation last April when Maria, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said: “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. Moskalyov was subsequently fined about £350 for a post online in which he characterised the Russian army as “rapists”. The remarks came since revelations of alleged war crimes committed against civilians at Bucha in Ukraine. The case has provoked an outcry among Russian human rights activists and sparked an online campaign to reunite the father and daughter. The banned rights group Memorial said it considered Moskalyov to be a political prisoner. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022, Associated Press reports. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Addressing a crowd of people on a square in Okhtyrka, he promised that the city would be rebuilt. Zelenskiy said: We won’t let any wound remain on the body of our state. In Trostianets, Zelensky honoured soldiers at the local railway station, where Ukrainian authorities say the Russians tortured prisoners. One resident told the AP that the president’s visit to the city meant a lot to him, adding: It’s a symbol of unity and the iron will that brought the country together. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. About 2,000 civilians remain in Avdiivka, a Donetsk region city about 90km (56 miles) south-west of the besieged Bakhmut, according to officials. The city had a prewar population of more than 30,000. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. He added: The town is being wiped off the face of the Earth. Barabash, in a Telegram post yesterday, said Russian forces were turning Avdiivka into “a place from post-apocalyptic movies”. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. After months of prevaricating, the German government announced in late January it would provide Kyiv with the state-of-the-art fighting vehicles as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 in order to make up the numbers of a Ukrainian battalion, with Portugal contributing three tanks and Sweden 10. Poland has supplied Ukraine with a battalion of the older Leopard 2 A4 model. “As promised, our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends”, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said on Monday night. “I am sure that they can make the difference on the front.” The vehicles were handed over at the Ukrainian border at the end of last week, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported, adding that 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and two tank recovery vehicles promised by Berlin have also arrived in Ukraine. For security reasons, the German government would not comment on the route by which the tanks were delivered. Kyiv, which had a limited numbers of tanks from the Soviet or post-Soviet era, has said it urgently needs heavier armour for its defence against Russia’s invasion, with the German-made Kampfpanzer Leopard 2 at the top of its list. Read the full story here: One evening in late December, as Muscovites strolled along their city’s brightly lit streets in anticipation of the end-of-year celebrations, a group of old friends gathered for dinner at the flat of a senior state official. Some of the guests present, which included members of Russia’s cultural and political elite, toasted a new year in which they expressed hope for peace and a return to normality. As the night went on, a man who needed little introduction stood up for a toast, holding his glass. “I am guessing you are expecting me to say something,” said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s longtime spokesperson, according to one of the two people who separately recounted the evening to the Guardian under conditions of anonymity. “Things will get much harder. This will take a very, very long time,” Peskov continued. His toast darkened the mood of the evening among the guests, many of whom have said in private that they oppose the war in Ukraine. One guest said: It was uncomfortable to hear his speech. It was clear that he was warning that the war will stay with us and we should prepare for the long haul. Read the full story by my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth: Nearly 4,400 Ukrainian orphans and children are held “deprived of parental care” in Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. Vereshchuk accused Russia of concealing information about the children, and said Kyiv had deployed a wide range of government agencies to supply evidence to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin and his children’s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children. She added: There’s already enough evidence. We hope our efforts and pressure from the international community will speed up the process of returning our children. The UK and Poland will build two temporary villages in western and central Ukraine to provide housing for people who have been forced from their homes by Russia’s invasion, the UK government has said. The villages in Lviv and Poltava will offer accommodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, a fraction of the millions either displaced in Ukraine or who have fled the country since the war began more than a year ago. The UK has announced up to £10m in funding to support the partnership, which will deliver temporary shelters, energy supplies and assistance to those who have fled heavy fighting on the frontlines or lost their homes because of Russian shelling. In a statement, the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: For the past year, Putin has continued to target civilian homes and infrastructure, with the Ukrainian people paying a heavy price. This new UK-Poland partnership will help bring light, heat and homes to those most in need. The international community is resolute in our shared determination to support the Ukrainian people and see them prevail with a just peace on Ukrainian terms. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of recent shelling in the Russian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Several explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv air defence said it shot down all drones involved. A cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses, were hit in the border village of Chernatske in Sumy, while a hospital was struck in the Dnipro district of Kherson. Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, posted a video thanking the UK for the first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks to arrive in Ukraine. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” he wrote on Twitter. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap Ukrainian imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would keep demanding an international investigation into explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea last year, after failing to win United Nations backing for an investigation. Reuters reports that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in his regular daily media briefing that everyone should be interested in an impartial investigation in order to find the culprits. On Monday, Russia failed to get the UN security council to ask for an independent inquiry into explosions in September that ruptured the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany and spewed gas into the Baltic Sea. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has had its Black Sea ports blocked since Russia invaded more than a year ago and has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through EU states Poland and Romania. But Reuters reports that logistical bottlenecks mean that large quantities of Ukrainian grain, which is cheaper than that produced in the European Union, has ended up in central European states, hurting prices and sales of local farmers. Romanian and Polish prime ministers Nicolae Ciucă and Mateusz Morawiecki told a business conference in Bucharest their governments were working on solutions with the EU. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, gave the UK the thumbs up as he took a ride in what he said was the first British Challenger 2 main battle tank to arrive in Ukraine. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine, which is preparing for a possible counteroffensive against Russian forces that invaded 13 months ago. Reuters reports Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. “It was a pleasure to take the first Ukrainian Challenger 2 MBT [main battle tank] for a spin,” Reznikov wrote. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions.” In the video, he gave the thumbs up sign and thanked British defence secretary Ben Wallace for the tanks. “Marvellous, Ben,” he said in English. “It’s … very good stuff. Thank you very much from Ukraine to the United Kingdom.” Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia, but senior officials in Kyiv have on occasion appeared to welcome the news of successful drone attacks on Russian soil. “The key threat now is acts of illegal interference through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles,” Shulginov said during a roundtable discussion where he addressed the security of Russia’s energy facilities. He said he was cooperating with Russia’s defence ministry and FSB security service on the issue. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Moscow sees capturing Bakhmut as vital in its efforts to establish complete control over the Donbas industrial region in eastern Ukraine. “They do not stop trying to surround and capture the city,” Reuters report Syrskyi said in the video posted on the Telegram messaging app. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Bakhmut had a prewar population of about 70,000 people but the city has been virtually destroyed in about eight months of intense fighting, often at close quarters. Syrskyi has been meeting troops near the frontline as Ukraine prepares for a possible counteroffensive after 13 months of war. He said on Monday the defence of Bakhmut was a military necessity. Syrskyi said his visits to meet troops near the frontline were needed for him and his commanders to agree on plans that would have “real results on the battlefield but not on the maps”. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. Reuters reports Novak said energy revenues accounted for 42% of Russia’s federal budget in 2022 and said the country’s energy industry was sustainable, despite the challenges faced by western sanctions. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that a hospital in Kherson has been struck overnight. Citing officials from the local administration, it writes: Around 4 o’clock in the morning, Russian troops shelled a hospital in the Dnipro district of Kherson. There were at least five explosions. One of the shells hit the fifth floor of the building. The blast wave knocked out almost all the windows in the main building on one side. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security, Reuters reports, citing Russian news agency Tass. Minsk also said the plans – announced over the weekend by Vladimir Putin – to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, would not contravene international non-proliferation agreements as Belarus would not have control over the weapons. Tass quotes the ministry saying: Military cooperation between Belarus and Russia is carried out in strict accordance with international law. The training of Belarusian pilots capable of flying aircraft with specific ammunition, the modernisation of such aircraft, as well as the deployment of nuclear warheads on the territory of Belarus without transferring control over them to Minsk, as well as access to appropriate technology, do not in any way contradict the provisions of articles I and II of the non-proliferation treaty. The ministry said it was forced to respond because “unilateral coercive measures in politics and the economy are accompanied by the buildup of military potential in the territory of neighboring countries – Nato members in close proximity to our borders. Considering these circumstances and the legitimate concerns and risks in the field of national security arising from them, Belarus is taking forced response actions to strengthen its own security and defence capability.” It also noted that Belarus regards the actions of the west as “direct and gross interference in the internal affairs of an independent state, aimed at changing the geopolitical course and changing the internal political system of Belarus”. State-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting this morning some words from Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, about the situation in Bakhmut. Tass quotes Pushilin on the Soloviev Live TV channel on Tuesday saying: Now [Wagner mercenary group troops] have created unbearable conditions for the enemy to even carefully try to bring up combat kits, bring up reserves, take out even the wounded – all this is extremely difficult for the enemy, because all the roads are already being shot through by [Wagner mercenary troops]. As for the city itself, here it was important to clean up the industrial zone at the Azom plant itself. Pretty much we can already talk about this, the guys there are finishing off the militants, but those are single groups. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian state media has previously reported that Wagner forces were in full control of the Azom metallurgical plant in the north of the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that this morning the border village of Chernatske in Sumy oblast has been struck. It writes: “Twenty hits were recorded, probably from barrel artillery. The infrastructure of the village was damaged – a cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses.” The UK Ministry of Defence says Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Slovyansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians – although numbers were not immediately available. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. According to the update, Russian forces also carried out attacks with 15 Shahed-136 type strike UAVs. 14 of them were destroyed by our defenders. In the same period, the Ukrainian air force carried out nine strikes against Russian forces and one attack on an anti-aircraft missile complex. Ukrainian solders also shot down five reconnaissance drones of various types. Rocket forces and artillery also struck three control points and areas of concentration, an artillery unit in firing position, an ammunition warehouse, a fuel warehouse and “two more important targets”. The claims have not been independently verified. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. In a post to Twitter, Pistorius said he believed the tanks would make a “crucial difference at the front”. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. Britain’s Challenger tanks have arrived in Ukraine, a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Kyiv said on Monday. Spokesperson for the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Iryna Zolotar, told the AFP that the tanks had been received. They are in Ukraine already. No further details were provided. The tanks are expected to be involved in any spring counter-offensive launched by Ukraine. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said earlier on Monday he inspected a “new addition” to the country’s forces – Challenger tanks as well as Germany’s Marder infantry fighting vehicles, plus Cougar armoured trucks and Stryker armoured personnel carriers from the US. A year ago, no one would have thought that our partners’ support would be so strong. The ISW also said higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka “potentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the area”. The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the Donetsk People’s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help “explain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past week”. The Institute for Study of War (ISW) says it has been monitoring chattering among Russian military bloggers about the dismissal of Russian military commanders overseeing troops in combat zones. Rumours have been circulating that Rusam Muradov has been dismissed as Eastern Military District Commander, and Yevgeny Nikiforov has been replaced as Western Military District Commander. The ISW could not confirm either change in leadership but said it was, “noteworthy that Russian millbloggers are discussing potential dismissals of commanders associated with areas of operation in which Russian forces have been largelyunable to secure substantial gains or have suffered major losses”. The UN security council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate the blasts on the pipelines that move natural gas from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea. Russia, China and Brazil voted in favour of the Russian request, but other security council members abstained or said another investigation was unnecessary. For a resolution to be adopted by the security council, it needs a minimum of nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council, and no veto by one of the permanent members – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. The US deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, said there was no need for a UN investigation when inquiries by Sweden, Denmark and Germany “are proceeding in a comprehensive, transparent and impartial manner”. It was an attempt to discredit the work of ongoing national investigations and prejudice any conclusions they reached that do not comport to Russia’s predetermined and political narrative. It was not an attempt to seek the truth. The pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, are majority-owned by Russia’s state-run energy giant Gazprom. Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The explosions on both occurred on 26 September. The investigations by European nations have yet to yield conclusive results, at least none made public. AP Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night following a drone attack, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties with Kyiv air defence reporting it had shot down all 13 Russian drones involved in the attack. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president has told IAEA head, Rafael Grossi, that safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility could not be guaranteed until Russian troops left. Zelenskiy also “visited advanced positions” in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday. The pair met to discuss the management of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant where Zelenskiy told him he could not guarantee the security of the facility so long as the area remained occupied by Russian troops. British challenger tanks are “in Ukraine already” according to Ukrainian defence minister Iryna Zolotar, no further details provided AFP reports. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. In other developments: Zelenskiy also spoke with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda to discuss the ongoing war and “current defense needs of Ukraine and joint diplomatic efforts for the near future”. Russian navy vessels have fired supersonic anti-ship missiles at a mock target in the Sea of Japan. The Russian defence ministry reported the exercises on Tuesday, saying “the target, located at a distance of about 100 kilometres, was successfully hit by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missiles.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll. At least two people were killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were damaged or destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Western companies selling their Russian businesses and leaving face a compulsory 10% direct donation to the government, the Financial Times has reported, after a ruling by Russia’s foreign investments commission. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech to the British parliament in February. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing it one step closer to becoming a full member of the alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and six against with no abstentions. Turkey is the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T05:00:26Z","webTitle":"‘It would survive nuclear Armageddon’: should plastic grass be banned?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","fields":{"bodyText":"My lawn is a disaster. To be honest, it’s not really a lawn at all. Any green is mostly moss, the rest is mud. More no man’s land than bowling green. The reasons for this are: small London garden (I know I am lucky to have one); not a lot of sun (stolen by the neighbour’s overhanging apple tree); two footballing boys (even though, now banned for life, they have to go to the park). And possibly also inexpertise on the part of the groundsman, though he has tried – I’ve turfed, and seeded, aerated, watered, fed, scarified, sung to it. I’m about ready to give up. There is an obvious solution: artificial grass. Beautifully, uniformly verdant all year round, low maintenance, no mowing required, no mower required, no watering, no mud. I might even let the boys back on to it. Or not. I’m not alone in thinking of faking it. A survey last year by Aviva found that 10% of UK homeowners with outside space had replaced at least some of their garden’s natural lawn with artificial grass, and a further 29% plan to or would consider making the swap. During the pandemic, when everyone was thinking about the outdoors, searches for “artificial grass” jumped 185% from May 2019 to 2020, according to Google Trends. My own search finds dozens of firms offering artificial grass, seducing me with pictures of lawns that look like the green baize of snooker tables. And promises – no mud, no sweat, no tears. And no guilt either – here’s one that says it’s “better for the environment” – because you don’t have to water, mow or fertilise. Well, that’s a relief, though we’ll return to this later. I might miss the smell of summer: freshly cut grass. What, I don’t have to? I can brush in artificial grass cleaner with that very fragrance? Happy days. Soon I have a quote for supply and installation, 40 sq metres of a mid-range product: £2,900 plus VAT. Ouch. But you can just buy the stuff for as little as £7 a sq metre – how hard can it be to DIY? Artificial grass was invented by James M Faria and Robert T Wright at Monsanto and first installed on a recreation area of a school in Providence Rhode Island in 1964. It hit the headlines a couple of years later when it was laid in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, and became known as AstroTurf. Artificial turf for sport, now produced under different brand names by other companies, has become increasingly controversial, most seriously after being potentially linked to the deaths of six professional baseball players in Philadelphia, who had the same rare form of cancer. It often uses rubber granules from recycled tyres, which can contain heavy metals, benzene and other carcinogens. Artificial grass for domestic use and landscaping, which began to be a thing in the 1990s, is normally made from polypropylene or nylon (polyamide) and doesn’t often contain rubber granules. The global artificial turf market (including sports use and domestic use) grew 8.4% in the past year to $4.87 bn (£3.95bn) and is expected to reach $6.83 bn (£5.6bn) in 2027. No wonder so many companies want to put plastic over your garden. Before I take the plunge, I ask Guardian readers to share their experiences of artificial lawns. Some are positive. Several, including Don in Fife and Wayne in Worcester, mention their dogs digging up the old grass. And Alex in Surrey’s greyhounds used to bring mud into the house. Not any more. As well as dogs, children come up. “It’s been wonderful, and the grandchildren love it,” says Charles in Berkshire. And when it comes to croquet, in-house knowledge of the small bumps and inconsistencies in the surface allows them “to win against all comers”. Home advantage – I like it. Phil in Weston-super-Mare did it for his son to play football on – just a little bit in the goalmouth, “so it didn’t become a mud bath”. It was the same for Genevieve in Kent: her kids turned the garden into a quagmire, so they put down fake grass. “It was the most successful thing – they just played football all the time. It was brilliant to have a party on too – people put their fags out on it and it was fine. I think it would survive nuclear Armageddon.” This was a while back, in the 00s, when her family were pioneers of artificial grass. They’ve moved house since then: “We wouldn’t get artificial grass now.” Not just because the kids have grown up. “Because of all the reasons we now know we shouldn’t have it.” *** ‘I can’t stand plastic grass!” bellows the naturalist Iolo Williams, who presents the BBC’s Springwatch, speaking from his home in mid-Wales. “It is hugely damaging to the environment on several levels. First of all it takes away the natural habitat from a whole host of species, notably invertebrates like earthworms, valuable in their own right but also a valuable food source for all kinds of birds and mammals.” Last year’s WWF Living Planet Report found that globally, wildlife populations have plunged by 69% over the past 50 years, with the UK one of the most nature-depleted countries in Europe. This is not the time to be destroying natural habitats and breaking up food chains. “If you want to see blackbirds and song thrushes, you’ve got to have grass full of invertebrates,” says Williams. “People are lamenting the decline of a lot of these birds, but if you stick down plastic grass, what do you expect? You reap what you sow. I would love to see plastic grass banned once and for all. It makes me very angry. I absolutely detest it.” Lynne Marcus, co-chair of the Society of Garden Designers, also underlines the fact that artificial lawns are no-go zones for wildlife. “People may say butterflies or bees can land around it, on the strips of soil we have with a few plants, but it’s like if you put a motorway down the middle of a forest. The animals can’t get from one side to the other to procreate.” With support from the Royal Horticultural Society and the Landscape Institute, the society has launched a campaign on this issue. It wants people to say no to fake grass. The charge sheet is a long one: artificial lawns destroy natural habitats and soil; they contribute to carbon emissions during manufacture and transport, whereas real grass absorbs CO2; they overheat in the summer and contribute to urban heat islands; they cause flooding as they absorb less than 50% of the rain that falls on them; they pollute waterways, as over time the plastic breaks down into microplastics, which is washed into our drainage and discharged into rivers and the sea; they are neither biodegradable nor recyclable, and after their life cycle (typically up to about 15 years) they go into landfill where they will continue to pollute. In short, they are an environmental nightmare, green in colour only. “Every time you put one down, you’re saying: ‘I know we’re all worried about climate change, but guess what, I’m going to contribute to it,’” says Marcus, before adding that she doesn’t want to blame people. “It’s about public engagement with the issue, informing and educating.” She rejects any idea that they are maintenance-free, explaining that over time they accumulate a buildup of excrement and urine from birds, mice, foxes, cats and dogs, and have to be regularly cleaned and disinfected. “You can’t get a plastic bag, yet you can cover your garden in plastic,” says Marcus. “It seems to me there should be something illegal about that.” And she thinks that in years to come we’ll look back at it in the same way as we now look back at driving without seatbelts or smoking next to babies. “Oh my God, can you believe it, we used to lay plastic lawns!” The tide does seem to be turning. The Chelsea Flower show banned fake grass last year. Ed Horne of the RHS, which runs the event, said: “Fake grass is just not in line with our ethos and views on plastic. We recommend using real grass because of its environmental benefits, which include supporting wildlife, mitigating flooding and cooling the environment.” The housing secretary Michael Gove plans to prevent developers from laying fake grass in new housing schemes. The mood is reflected in some more of our reader responses. In Somerset, JP put down a plastic lawn because it was a tiny patch and grass wouldn’t grow. “Within months it started stinking of urine due to the dog toileting on it. About six months ago we’d had enough and I ripped it out. I regret the waste of plastic. We now have a sedum lawn, which loves poor soil and is fantastic for pollinators. I wish we’d done that all along.” In South Ayrshire, Dennis inherited a plastic lawn when they moved to their place. “It was filthy, and had faded to a light insipid green.” So they removed it, and the gravel underneath, imported topsoil and compost, and planted butterfly- and bee-friendly shrubs and flowers. “Our garden, lifeless before, is now full of life.” Barbara Samitier, a French garden designer working in London, thinks that the need for a perfect green lawn may be a peculiarly British thing. “You can’t imagine a garden without it. I think it belongs to the kind of imagery maybe from cricket, Wimbledon, this green and pleasant land. It’s what people in this country have been raised to see as nature.” There are alternatives that aren’t plastic, even if you have a small, north-facing city garden and children. “You can do a little woodland, make it more a sort of exploratory playground. A family garden doesn’t need to be about an expanse of lawn – there are different ways to engage children outdoors.” Even if you have a lawn, it doesn’t have to look like Centre Court on the opening day of Wimbledon. “If I look at a perfect lawn, it doesn’t make me feel relaxed,” says Samitier. “I’m thinking it uses a lot of water, requires a lot of cutting, also chemicals to keep it weed-free and to keep it going in spite of the changes in weather. Whereas if I look at a less perfect lawn with maybe some long grass, areas that haven’t been mown, I know there is a lot of life in there, insects and pollinators. For me, that looks a lot more beautiful.” It’s about accepting the seasons. “It doesn’t have to be perfect all the time, so in the winter it gets muddy, in the summer it’s dry but that’s fine: it comes back when it rains. I think in England a lot of gardens are about ego and controlling, making everything do exactly what you want, the grass needs to be perfect and all of this. But now we see the beauty of letting go a bit and accepting we don’t have to control everything.” Artificial grass makes Samitier’s heart sink. “Don’t do it! You’ll regret it,” she warns me. But it’s OK, because I’m already moving away from plasticking over my scruffy little urban patch and trying to see it in a new light. Not mud and mess, but life and beauty … well, let’s not carried away. Not no man’s land, though, nor no beast’s land. There is birdsong. And right on cue, almost as if it was paid, a dunnock shuffles on to my not-lawn and starts hopping around, hunting for breakfast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T10:00:36Z","webTitle":"Trump-era officials under fire as nuclear fund for Bikini islanders is squandered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","fields":{"bodyText":"Former staff have lashed the US Department of the Interior for failing to predict that a 2017 decision to lift oversight from a $59m trust fund for Pacific Islanders displaced by American nuclear testing would lead to the fund’s exhaustion through mismanagement and alleged fraud. Tom Bussanich, who in 2017 was a senior official in the department’s Office of Insular Affairs, said that he “would have bet money that there would have been issues with the trust fund and that the money would have been wasted”. Allen Stayman, a former director of the Office of Insular Affairs, dismissed the office as “the agency of acquiescence”. Meanwhile, confidential bank documents reviewed by the Guardian reveal red flags that could have alerted the department to potential issues had it been scrutinising the fund, including the transfer of millions of dollars to two personal checking accounts over which the fund’s trustees had no oversight. Together, the criticism and confidential documents are likely to increase the pressure the interior department faces for its role in the fund’s exhaustion, which left thousands of nuclear survivors and their descendants bereft. The US government established the fund in the 1980s to support displaced residents of Bikini Atoll, a small reef in the Pacific nation of the Marshall Islands which the US left uninhabitable after it tested 23 nuclear weapons there between 1946 and 1958. Until recently, the fund provided several million dollars each year to a council that oversaw the displaced Bikinians, helping to provide housing, food and education in a country where the median income is $9,600 and almost half of households skip meals due to lack of money. In 2016, however, Anderson Jibas was elected mayor of the Bikinian council and began pushing the interior department to hand over control of the fund. In 2017, Douglas Domenech, who Donald Trump had appointed as assistant interior secretary, announced that the department would hand over control of the fund, which by then held $59m, to “restore trust and ensure that sovereignty means something”. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the fund had been whittled down to about $100,000, largely through extravagant spending by Jibas on projects including land development in Hawaii, new ships and planes, and an apartment complex in the Marshall Islands. Annual bank statements reviewed by the Guardian show that some of the money was disbursed directly from the trust fund to the vendors with whom Jibas and other local officials were negotiating. Because those disbursements were direct, they allowed the fund’s trustees to exercise a measure of oversight. But the statements also show that Jibas and the council’s American lawyer, Gordon Benjamin, instructed trustees to disburse large sums of money to a Bank of Guam checking account that they said was being used for “council operations” but which the trustees could not scrutinise. In 2019, for example, Jibas and Benjamin instructed trustees to disburse $15.36m to the Bank of Guam account. When asked about the Bank of Guam account, Jibas said in a written statement that he had “no idea what you are talking about”. The Guardian also reviewed correspondence between Benjamin and the trustees and found cases of controversial spending. In March 2019, for example, Benjamin wrote that, “Since early February, a team of [Bikinian] Council, an engineer, two contractors, and I have been on an active search for an airplane for KBE Tourism. Payments to at least one of the contractors, plus travel expenses and per diems etc. has begun to mount as travel has taken the team to Europe and Asia in search of an airplane.” Benjamin said the team was travelling to Papua New Guinea and “needs $250,000 immediately” to be disbursed from the fund to the Bank of Guam account to cover travel expenses and a partial deposit on a potential plane. Also in 2019, Benjamin instructed the trustees to send $50,000 directly to Jibas’s Bank of Hawaii personal savings account. Benjamin explained that the money was part of a council-approved “representation package” to pay for “meetings with contractors, consultants, U.S. Government and Marshall Islands’ Government and Local Government representatives”. Benjamin did not respond to questions about the spending. Some of Jibas and Benjamin’s early instructions to the trustees included the signatures of a majority of the Bikinian council. Later, the process was changed so that disbursements could be made without evidence that they had been approved by the wider council. Jibas said this change was made by the trustees. The release of large sums to checking accounts that trustees could not scrutinise might have attracted concern from American officials, but by then the interior department was no longer receiving information about the fund from the Bikinian council or bank officials. The department declined to comment on the bank documents. From 2018, Jibas refused to provide the council’s financial documents to the Marshallese auditor-general, forcing Marshallese police to forcibly seize the documents in 2021. In an interview with the New York Times, Jibas admitted he occasionally used money from the fund to pay for personal items. Jibas told the Guardian that he had also directed between $200,000 and $250,000 from the fund towards the construction of a two-story house for his personal use. He claimed this project had been approved by the Bikinian council. Stayman, the former director of the Office of Insular Affairs, said the interior department had withdrawn oversight despite the risk of fraud because it did not want to anger local officials. “The position of many officials behind the scenes has historically been that Interior shouldn’t have oversight, because if we have oversight, then we’re going to have disagreements with the islands, and we can’t handle disagreements,” Stayman said. The department declined to comment on the criticisms. Last week, following protests by Bikinians angered by the New York Times’s revelations, the Marshallese government temporarily placed the Bikinian council’s finances in the care of the national ministry of finance. In contrast, accountability in America seems less likely. An official familiar with the situation said the department was “hoping to contain the story” and “circling the wagons” against potential scrutiny by Congress. American spending in the Marshall Islands is largely overseen by the Senate committee on energy and natural resources. Spokespeople for Senators Lisa Murkowski, Catherine Cortez-Mastro and Maria Cantwell, all members of the committee who expressed concern in 2018 about relinquishing oversight of the fund, did not respond to requests for comment about whether they would investigate the department’s management of the fund."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T15:00:29Z","webTitle":"Albanese government approves first new coalmine since taking power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian government has approved a new coalmine development for the first time since it was elected last year. Tanya Plibersek, the federal environment minister, indicated she would give the green light to the Isaac River coalmine in Queensland’s Bowen basin. It was announced late on Thursday. The mine, to be developed by Bowen Coking Coal, is planned for 28km east of Moranbah, next to five other coalmines, and expected to produce about 500,000 tonnes of metallurgical coal a year for five years. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used in steelmaking. “The Albanese government has to make decisions in accordance with the facts and the national environment law – that’s what happens on every project, and that’s what’s happened here,” a spokesperson for Plibersek said. “Since the election we’ve doubled renewable energy approvals to a record high. The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis, under the law.” The government said no submissions had been received about the project during the public consultation period, including from environment groups. But climate campaigners had made public statements calling on Plibersek to reject the mine in line with scientific advice that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C. “Scientists, energy and climate experts have said that the climate cannot afford new coalmines, and they’ve said it so many times I’ve lost count,” said Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. “The fact that this is a small coking coalmine is beside the point – fossil carbon needs to stay in the ground. We’ve already got more than enough coalmines approved to cook the planet, including coking coalmines that could run into next century. “This approval comes late in the evening in budget week, the perfect time for controversial news.” The announcement comes a week after Plibersek cancelled two coal projects whose applications had lapsed. Dr Coral Rowston, the director of EnvA (Environmental Advocacy) CQ, a grassroots group in central Queensland, said the project would affect habitat for the vulnerable ornamental snake. “The other key issue for us is the mine will also leave a legacy for our water quality in central Queensland due to the release of affected water from sediment dams into the Isaac River which feeds into the Great Barrier Reef.” Plibersek also plans to move three other projects – two in New South Wales and one in Queensland – to the next stage of the assessment process. The three mines are among a group of 19 proposed new coal and gas projects that Environment Justice Australia, on behalf of the Environment Council of Central Queensland, had sought to have reconsidered and effectively rejected because of their potential greenhouse gas emissions. “Today’s decision means minister Plibersek joins a long line of federal environment ministers who have said it’s not their job to consider the climate risk of new coal and gas mines,” the council’s president Christine Carlisle said. The government found it could not stop the projects at this point in the process because national environmental laws state they would have to prove the emissions of a specific project would be a substantial cause of climate change effects on matters of national environmental significance. Of the remaining 16 projects, five have been withdrawn by the developers or cancelled by the government due to lapsed applications. Thursday’s decision leaves 11 still to be reconsidered by Plibersek. Environmental Justice Australia senior lawyer Retta Berryman said: “Our client is carefully considering all legal options in light of today’s decision – including one or more federal court challenges.” • This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to remove a statement from Coral Rowston referring to koala and greater glider habitat.

Areas that have been earmarked by the government as part of its levelling up agenda are about three times as likely to be rich in untapped energy from the earth, according to an academic study commissioned by No 10. The University of Durham found these include Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, East Lindsey, Hartlepool, Northumberland and Bassetlaw, which all appear in the top 10 of the index used by government to identify local authority areas in need of levelling up. Other areas well-suited to producing geothermal heat and electricity include Newcastle upon Tyne, North East Derbyshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire and Nottingham. Harnessing geothermal energy involves drilling a borehole to depths of about two to three miles, to flow cold water at low pressures through the hot rocks beneath the Earth’s surface. A second borehole returns the warm water to the surface where it can be used to heat homes and businesses or generate electricity. Kieran Mullan MP, who was tasked with producing the report, said the “strong overlap” between areas in need of investment and the best geothermal locations was unexpected, but it could provide another reason for the government to look again at supporting the renewable energy technology. “Unlike wind or solar this technology provides baseload – it is there constantly. And our expertise in drilling in the North Sea means we are well placed to motor ahead,” Mullan said. The UK’s early steps into geothermal energy include a project in Seaham, County Durham, which will use water from mineshafts to heat 1,500 new homes and a scheme at the Eden project in Cornwall which generates heat to warm Eden’s rainforest and Mediterranean biomes as well as offices, kitchens and greenhouses. In theory, the UK has enough geothermal energy trapped underground to heat every home for a hundred years. Even by conservative estimates that account for realistic commercial and logistical limits, geothermal energy could help the UK to cut its imports of fossil fuels and rely only on the North Sea for its gas. “But we have catching up to do because across Europe there has been much stronger government intervention to support nascent deep geothermal industries in those countries,” Mullan said. Deep geothermal energy is abundant in Iceland owing to its unique geology but countries in western Europe are increasingly using geothermal energy to help produce green heating. Already more than 250,000 homes in Paris rely on geothermal heating and the German government has committed to spending €1bn (£860m) before 2035 to create 100 geothermal projects. Rishi Sunak said the report would help the government decide whether there was a bigger role for deep geothermal energy in the UK economy. “We have made rapid progress on switching to homegrown renewable electricity and have made energy security a key priority. Success is going to depend on pulling all the levers at our disposal,” the prime minister said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T01:00:53Z","webTitle":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","fields":{"bodyText":"Local governments in China approved more new coal power in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021, according to official documents. The approvals, analysed by Greenpeace, reveal that between January and March this year, at least 20.45 gigawatts of coal power was approved, up from 8.63GW in the same period in 2022. In the whole of 2021, 18GW of coal was approved. A Chinese Communist party (CCP) five-year plan from 2016 had placed a heavy emphasis on reducing the use of coal and developing clean energy sources. In 2020 Xi Jinping, China’s leader, pledged that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060. This prompted an era of reduced coal power approvals as local governments sought to keep their local economies in check with Beijing’s priorities. A rise in coal power approvals came in 2020 when the five-year plan came to an end, as local governments anticipated even tighter restrictions on coal expansion in the next round. But in 2021, China suffered huge power outages, leading to a dramatic shift in the CCP’s energy priorities. In September the price of electricity soared as factories reopened to service global demand as the rest of the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government had capped prices, so many power plants reduced output rather than operated at a loss. China relies on coal for more than half of its energy consumption. As homes in the colder north of the country faced the prospect of a gruelling winter without heat, the government’s rhetoric shifted from reducing coal to prioritising energy security. That resulted in a “myth that if you build more power plants, that will bring more energy security,” said Xie Wenwen, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. The war in Ukraine, which sent global energy prices soaring, was “another huge event that fuelled the energy security narrative”. Campaigners argue that in order to meet China’s growing energy needs, it is not more coal that is needed, but a more flexible grid. A report published this month by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, noted that technologies for storing clean energy “are not yet mature enough to be deployed at the scale considered essential” for China’s plans to expand the use of renewable energy. More than 75% of China’s coal, wind, solar and hydro resources are in the west of the country, while more than 70% of power consumption happens in central and eastern China. Five provinces on the east coast account for nearly two-fifths of China’s total consumption. Policymakers have yet to find a solution for efficiently rebalancing this problem. Still, in the 14th five-year plan, which covers the period until 2025, the government said that more than half of increased energy demands in that period should be covered by renewables. Between 2010 and 2021, renewable generation increased by an average annual rate of 19.2%, primarily from wind and solar power. But last year Xi said that coal would remain a mainstay of China’s energy mix that “would be hard to change in the short term”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-03T19:00:17Z","webTitle":"Protest review – schoolgirls unite with the power of dissent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","fields":{"bodyText":"Hannah Lavery constructs her play from simple sentences.

The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry. Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales, said “we definitely have a healthy nuclear industry in Australia, but it’s often overlooked”, citing nuclear safeguards and research into nuclear materials, nuclear medicine and waste. “On the other hand … it needs to grow manyfold.” Prof Gregory Lane, who convenes the master of nuclear science program at the Australian National University, agrees. “There’s a lot of knowledge about nuclear science. It’s required in all sorts of different areas: mining, health, sterilisation of materials for general industry, industrial gauging.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup UNSW administers the only nuclear engineering degrees in the country, while the ANU is the only one to educate students in nuclear science. “The skills are available in Australia but there are specifics of [Aukus] that we’ve never had to deal with and they’re going to have to be developed over time,” Lane said, adding: “Fundamentally, we don’t have a nuclear power program in Australia.” The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto), a government agency, runs a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lane describes the Ansto reactor as “one of the most technologically advanced reactors of its type”, which produces neutrons for experiments and to make medical isotopes. “But that’s a very different beast to a reactor that is used for power and then a reactor that you’re going put under water and needs to be absolutely failsafe.” Burr and Lane agree that some nuclear personnel will need to be trained overseas. V Adm Jonathan Mead confirmed last week that some Royal Australian Navy officers were completing a nuclear reactor course in the US and also enrolled in UNSW and ANU programs. Burr said UNSW had about 125 graduates each year across its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, while Lane said more than 20 students were currently enrolled in the ANU master’s program. For the nuclear-powered submarines, “suitably qualified and experienced personnel” will be required at three tiers of expertise, Burr said. The first tier are those who are “nuclear aware”, which would require only several months of training, Burr said. “In a nuclear submarine … even something as simple as welding a pipe needs to be done by a nuclear-aware welder” – someone with additional training about the implications of working with nuclear-grade materials. “If the weld goes wrong while you’re at sea, it could be catastrophic.” The second tier are people who “have somewhere between five and 10 years of experience, and they typically have an education in engineering as well”. The third tier, requiring the most expertise, are those with 20 to 30 years’ experience and a PhD at a minimum. UNSW modelling, led by Dr Edward Obbard, forecasts that operating and maintaining eight nuclear-propelled submarines would directly require several thousand tier 1 personnel, about 2,500 people at tier 2 and about 200 tier 3 subject matter experts. Experts say scaling up local nuclear capabilities will require national coordination. “This needs to be a coordinated, collaborative effort from all nuclear training and education institutions in Australia,” Burr said. “Ansto will have a crucial role to play, not in education, but in some level of training and some level of government advisory.” Lane said: “We need to be looking at regulation, law, engineering, strategic studies, health – all of these things matter in supporting a nuclear submarine effort.” Ansto declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-19T00:30:08Z","webTitle":"Albanese urged to take stand against nuclear weapons during G7 summit in Hiroshima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese is being urged to take a firm stand against nuclear weapons when he attends the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend.

A Nobel prize-winning group, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), has written to Albanese to urge him to make good on Labor’s promise to join a new treaty to impose an outright ban on nuclear weapons. The party platform said a Labor government would sign and ratify the treaty, after taking account of factors including the need to work to achieve universal international support. Ican cited Albanese’s speech championing the treaty in 2018 when he denounced nuclear weapons as “the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created”. “At the 2018 National Labor Conference, you showed what strong leadership on this issue looks like,” said the letter from the co-chairs of Ican Australia, Dr Margaret Beavis and Associate Prof Marianne Hanson. “You now have the unique responsibility to show the world once again what leadership on this critical issue looks like. “We urge you to take the opportunity to advance Australia’s position on this treaty when you visit Hiroshima.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The letter argued the acquisition of nuclear-propelled, conventionally armed submarines under Aukus “sharpens the need for a binding and permanent commitment that Australia will not possess, host or assist with the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons now or in the future”. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is a relatively new treaty that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. The TPNW now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it. But it is opposed by the United States and other nuclear weapons states, which argue it is out of step with international security realities. The former Morrison government said the treaty’s terms were inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under the US alliance. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the TPNW “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. Talei Mangioni, 29, who is a PhD candidate at the Australian National University’s School of Culture, History and Language, addressed a youth summit in Hiroshima late last month. She hopes Albanese makes progress on the issue. The Ican Australia board member said she was touched to hear directly from hibakusha (survivor) Keiko Ogura about the “invisible scars” of the 1945 bombing and about visits to Japan by Pacific activists in the 1980s. “At the moment Australia is really out of step with the rest of the region,” said Mangioni, who is of Fijian and Italian descent and whose research focuses on the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement. “Most Pacific countries have either signed or ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. If he were to commit to the TPNW, I think it would send a great message to the region. The nuclear test legacy is a very serious issue in the Pacific and also for Aboriginal communities in Australia.” During the Albanese government’s first year in office, Australia has taken some cautious steps to engage with the TPNW, including sending a backbencher as an observer to the first meeting of the parties in Vienna last June. Australia followed that up by shifting its position at a UN committee in October to “abstain” after five years of actively opposing the treaty under the Coalition. But Albanese and senior ministers have avoided giving a clear timetable for joining the TPNW. Responding to a question from the independent MP Zoe Daniel in March, Albanese said a world without nuclear weapons “would be a very good thing”. “What we will do, though, is work systematically and methodically through the issues in accordance with the commitments that were made in the national platform,” he told parliament. Australia is not a G7 member but has been invited by Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to attend the Hiroshima summit as an outreach partner. Albanese said the government was “showing the world that Australia is back as a partner, a leader and a force for stability and growth in our region”. The leaders of the four Quad countries – Australia, Japan, the US and India – are expected to have a meeting on the sidelines this weekend. It follows the cancellation of next week’s Quad summit in Sydney after the US president, Joe Biden, cut short his regional travel to deal with the debt ceiling crisis. On Friday Albanese is expected to meet with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T15:24:02Z","webTitle":"Wisconsin senate supermajority win gives Republicans impeachment power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Wisconsin Republicans won a supermajority in the state senate on Tuesday, giving them the necessary votes to impeach statewide officials, including the state’s Democratic governor and potentially state supreme court justices. Wisconsin Republicans now control 22 of the senate’s 33 seats after Dan Knodl, a Republican, narrowly defeated Democrat Jodi Habush Sinykin in a special election to represent a district that includes Milwaukee’s northern suburbs. Republicans also control 64 of the state assembly’s 99 districts. The Wisconsin constitution authorizes the state assembly to impeach “all civil officers of this state for corrupt conduct in office, or for crimes and misdemeanor” by a majority vote. A two-thirds majority is required in the senate for a conviction. Republicans got their supermajority on the same night Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the state supreme court, giving liberals a majority on the bench when she is seated in August. The new liberal majority could strike down the state’s legislative districts, which were drawn by Republicans and give them a virtually impenetrable majority in the legislature. The court is also expected to strike down the state’s 1849 abortion ban. It is not clear whether state lawmakers will move forward with impeachment. The assembly has only once before impeached an official – a judge in 1853 who was acquitted, according to the Associated Press. It’s also not clear who qualifies for impeachment, as the constitution does not define who is a “civil officer”. Knodl, the Republican candidate who won on Tuesday, has said the legislature’s impeachment power would “certainly be tested” if he were elected. He has said he would consider impeaching Protasiewicz, who is currently a circuit court judge in Milwaukee, if she remained on the bench there. He did not say whether he would consider impeaching Protasiewicz as a supreme court justice, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Duey Stroebel, a Republican state senator, told the New York Times that impeaching Protasiewicz over rulings on abortion and electoral maps was not likely “but certainly not impossible”. “If she truly acts in terms of ignoring our laws and applying her own personal beliefs, then maybe that’s something people will talk about,” he told the Times. “If the rulings are contrary to what our state laws and constitution say, I think there could be an issue.” “We can’t say what the legislature will do or how likely any action is. But for this gerrymandered legislature to take steps toward removing democratically elected officials would be a profound abuse of power,” said Dan Lenz, a lawyer for Law Forward, a progressive non-profit legal group. Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he thinks the legislature is ready to “play hardball”. “Republicans, in their majority for the last 12 years, have not been shy about exploring what tools are available to them and trying to push them as far as possible,” he said. Republicans in Pennsylvania and Ohio in recent years have toyed with the idea of impeaching judges over their rulings on gerrymandering. Talk in both states quickly fizzled. One of the jurists threatened with impeachment, former Ohio Republican supreme court justice Maureen O’Connor, said she never really took impeachment talk seriously. O’Connor was one of the jurists threatened with impeachment after voting with Democrats to strike down GOP-friendly gerrymandered maps. “It wasn’t going to go anywhere – political drama,” she said earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/17/former-world-leaders-urge-g7-to-get-nuclear-arms-control-back-on-track","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-17T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"Former world leaders urge G7 to get nuclear arms control back on track","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/former-world-leaders-urge-g7-to-get-nuclear-arms-control-back-on-track","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/17/former-world-leaders-urge-g7-to-get-nuclear-arms-control-back-on-track","fields":{"bodyText":"A global array of former world leaders and defence ministers, nuclear experts and diplomats have called on the leaders of G7 countries at their meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, not to let progress on nuclear arms control continue to be the victim of growing geopolitical conflict, including the conflict between the west and Russia over Ukraine. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who is from Hiroshima, chose the G7 venue to lend seriousness to his personal call to world leaders to at least agree a roadmap to resume nuclear arms control talks. In February, Russia pulled out of the 2010 New Start treaty, a pact that sets limits on the deployed strategic nuclear arsenals of the world’s two largest nuclear powers, although Moscow said it would nevertheless abide by the limits for the moment. Kishida intends to take world leaders arriving this week for the summit to the harrowing Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, where they will see graphic depictions of the US attack in 1945. An open letter signed by six former heads of state, 20 cabinet-level ministers and experts from 50 different countries including China, Russia and the US lends momentum to Kishida’s G7 theme by saying the world needs more nuclear arms control, not less. The letter says: “United States-Russia strategic stability talks are in limbo and the New Start treaty, which has played an indispensable role in ensuring reciprocal security, is now in question. “As the only existing nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, the world’s two largest nuclear-armed countries, the treaty’s collapse or expiration without a replacement would threaten a destabilising arms race.” Worsening big-power competition is making nuclear war more likely, the leaders warn, and “failure to agree on a new nuclear arms control framework to replace New Start before it expires in February 2026 would also make it more difficult to bring China, France and the United Kingdom into multilateral arms control, as all three are not ready to consider limits on their nuclear arsenals until the United States and Russia bring down their nuclear stockpiles”. The letter was organised by the European Leadership Network and Asia-Pacific Leadership Network and signed by former world leaders, including Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and Ingvar Carlsson, the former prime minister of Sweden. In Russia, the signatories include Alexei Arbatov, the director of the International Security Center at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations; Pavel Palazhchenko, the head of the international centre at the Gorbachev Foundation, and Sergey Rogov, who until March last year, was a member of the scientific council of the national security council and a former adviser to the Duma international affairs committee. One of the most prominent signatories in China is Prof Chen Dongxiao, the president of Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. China has been clear in warning Russia not to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, a threat that has repeatedly been made by Moscow, including by transferring nuclear weapons to Belarus. UK signatories include the former head of MI6 John Scarlett, the former foreign secretaries Malcolm Rifkind and David Owen, as well as the former defence secretaries Des Browne and Tom King. The 256 signatories acknowledge they all have different views about geopolitical competition but say “we all agree that it is long past time to start prioritising nuclear arms control and taking unilateral, bilateral and multilateral actions”. The letter urges Russia and the US to compartmentalise nuclear arms control and isolate it from other disputes by confirming that they will not exceed the New Start limits on deployed nuclear forces, which thus far have not been violated, as well as agreeing to remove the obstacles to full implementation of their New Start obligations. It also calls for the resumption of the work of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, the body that agrees details of US and Russian inspections of each others’ military sites under the terms of the New Start treaty. The body has not met for nearly two years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-08T04:42:01Z","webTitle":"‘Chasing unicorns’: NSW Liberal minister rejects federal opposition push for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The New South Wales energy minister and treasurer, Matt Kean, has accused the federal Coalition of “chasing unicorns” over its push to overturn the moratorium on nuclear power in Australia. Since it lost power at last month’s election, the new federal opposition has begun a push for the longstanding ban on nuclear power to be lifted. Despite doing little to advance it as an energy source during its time in government, new Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has called for a “mature” conversation about the role of nuclear power in Australia. The new leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has indicated that support for nuclear energy could be a part of the Coalition’s future policy platform, while former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has backed calls to overturn the moratorium. “I don’t think we should rule things out simply because it’s unfashionable to talk about them,” Dutton said on Monday. But amid a reduction in new nuclear projects globally, Kean poured cold water on the push by his Coalition colleagues in Canberra on Wednesday, saying pursuing nuclear energy generation in Australia was currently a “fantasy”. While conceding nuclear “may have a role to play in our energy system in the future”, Kean said he hoped for a role for emerging nuclear technologies – such as small modular reactors – but that they would not help address rising energy costs in the short to medium term. Kean referred to the UK government’s underwriting of the construction of the Hinkley Point C station to the tune of about $300 a megawatt-hour, which he said was “three times more expensive than the current electricity bills at the height that we’re paying right now”. He said the cost and timeline of new nuclear energy meant it was not realistic to consider it as an option. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Not only that, they started the build of [Hinkley Point C station] in around 2008,” he said. “It’s now 2022 and it still hasn’t been turned on, so we can’t wait 20 years to chase some fantasy, which is large-scale nuclear. “What we need to do is focus on things that are going to lower household bills today and set us up for more prosperity in the future.” In 2019 the former federal Coalition government held a parliamentary inquiry into the role of nuclear. Chaired by the new shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, it recommended the government consider small modular reactors, which produce less energy but, proponents say, would be easier to keep safe. But many small nuclear reactor proposals overseas have been beset by problems , and Kean said that two of the firms pushing the use of the technology – Rolls-Royce and US firm NuScale – wouldn’t have prototypes ready for construction until the next decade. “So people talking about nuclear as an asset to our energy challenges right now are literally chasing unicorns,” Kean said. “This is a fantasy, which is not ready at the moment. But who knows, at some time in the future, we may crack the code of small nuclear reactors and that could play a role in our energy mix. “But right now, we are focusing on the things that we know work [and] that we know are going to drive down household bills and that’s why we’ve got our energy roadmap here in NSW to roll out solar, wind [and] pumped hydro storage with transmission lines. Because we know that that’s the best way to lower household bills to keep the lights on and to deliver clean, reliable electricity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T23:52:52Z","webTitle":"‘Big mistake’: Biden condemns Putin’s withdrawal from nuclear treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned as a “big mistake” Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend his country’s participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. The comment came as the US president closed out his wartime visit to Europe, working to shore up partnerships with allies on Nato’s perilous eastern flank – even as Putin was drawing closer to China for help as his invasion of Ukraine neared the year mark. Biden’s meeting with leaders of the Bucharest Nine nations in Warsaw came at the conclusion of a whirlwind, four-day visit to Ukraine and Poland meant to reassure allies that US support in fending off Russia is not at risk of waning. In dramatic counterpoint, Putin on Wednesday played host in Moscow to Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist party’s most senior foreign policy official, as US intelligence warned that Beijing is considering supplying arms and ammunition to the worn-down Russian military. The flexing of alliances was a fresh indication that both sides are digging in for prolonged conflict in Ukraine with the fighting expected to intensify with the arrival of spring. Biden had delivered a ringing speech on western unity in Warsaw, a day after he swept into Kyiv unannounced for a visit with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As Biden spoke in Poland, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. Biden has now called that departure “a big mistake”. The exit is expected to have an immediate impact on US awareness of Russian nuclear activities. However, the pact – known as New Start – was already on life support following Moscow’s cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that each side has accused the other of violating. “You’re the frontlines of our collective defense,” Biden told the Bucharest Nine, which comprises Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. “And you know, better than anyone, what’s at stake in this conflict. Not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world,” he added. These countries have worried that Putin could move to take military action against them next if he’s successful in Ukraine. Biden responded to that anxiety by pledging that Nato’s mutual defense pact is “sacred” and that “we will defend literally every inch of Nato”. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting, pointed to past Russian conduct in Georgia and Ukraine and said: “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T19:00:39Z","webTitle":"Strength and power of Manchester City can reinforce Premier League dominance | Karen Carney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","fields":{"bodyText":"The Premier League is the dominant force in the Champions League: Saturday’s final will be the fifth in six years to feature at least one English team. Football generally works in cycles, though, and the rest of the continent will be plotting to take over again. In the five finals before 2018, there was not an English side in sight and Spain was lording it over its rivals. Real Madrid won four out of five from 2013 in their dominant cycle, but they have been overtaken. Manchester City enter their second Champions League final in three years against Internazionale, who are the first Italian team since 2017 to reach this stage of a competition Serie A has dominated in the past. In the 10 seasons starting in 1988-89 an Italian club reached nine finals and won four. There are numerous reasons why the English game is enjoying a glorious spell. It is no coincidence the biggest clubs can attract the best managers. Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel have taken English teams into the Champions League with knowledge gained elsewhere of how to beat the best in Europe. They arrived with experience of different leagues. Managers learn from one another, too. Mikel Arteta and Erik ten Hag worked with Guardiola at City and Bayern Munich respectively and they are pushing one another to be at their best. Guardiola keeps evolving, changing things tactically each season to maintain City’s challenge for trophies. Klopp brought his pressing style to Liverpool and has taken them to three Champions League finals. Those styles and philosophies have added to the English culture of technical play and fandom, aided by players wanting to be with those managers. Guardiola knows what worked for him in the past will not necessarily work now. At Barcelona, he, in essence, invented the false 9 for Lionel Messi; at Bayern he did the inverted full-back with Philipp Lahm; this season we have seen him create John Stones’s hybrid role, which was carefully thought out and planned, and it has paid dividends in the biggest matches. Top managers’ tactics only work if they have the right players and the Premier League can attract the best in the world. Almost every team in Europe would like Erling Haaland but City were able to snare him because they have a coach everyone wants to work with. If we look at the clamour to sign Ilkay Gündogan it shows what incredible players City have. Players under Guardiola will be more desirable to bring in because of their skillset. The competitive nature of the Premier League is helping its clubs in Europe. City rarely had an easy weekend this season and had to fight for their points, regardless of who they were playing. There is strength throughout the league, which means the best teams have to push themselves. As an indication of how strong the Premier League is, Leicester won it seven years ago and were relegated this season. No other competition can boast this strength in depth. The need to maintain standards benefits a club such as City when they face quality opposition in the Champions League. What sets City apart, as Internazionale will know, is the physical advantage they have because of the high tempo required in the Premier League. I was at the FA Cup final, which was not City’s best performance, and got to watch from behind Guardiola’s dugout. It gave me a great perspective. I usually think in advance about what I am going to learn about the technical or tactical aspects but what really surprised me seeing City close up at Wembley was the sheer physicality of their team. The defence is really imposing – John Stones is slighter than Manuel Akanji, Rúben Dias and Kyle Walker, but he is still a big presence. Technically and tactically they are superb, but if they are drawn into one-v-one battles, they are physically dominant too – and then there is Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne and Haaland. Not many teams will be able to compete with that on a physical level and then we have to add in how good City are technically and tactically. If anyone tries to bully City, they are going to fail. United really struggled in those physical one-v-one battles. It was something I had never noticed and it was interesting to see. If City have to mix it up and go long, getting Haaland to pin the ball to hold it up, they can do that too. They have every attribute required and character to go with it. They can win the duels, meaning they get the ball back quickly, and their work rate does not give opponents the chance to build a couple of passes or have any respite in possession. That is why sides have to counterattack against them or pick their moment wisely and City are well set up to deal with that. Bayern and Real Madrid learned to their cost about City’s relentless pressing and clinical nature. They will take these lessons and look at how they can close the gap to instigate a new cycle of dominance for German or Spanish football. But the Premier League has the momentum and I cannot see that changing any time soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"12m Americans believe violence is justified to restore Trump to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","fields":{"bodyText":"Two and a half years after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, an estimated 12 million American adults, or 4.4% of the adult population, believe violence is justified to restore Donald Trump to the White House. Though the number of adults who believe this has declined since the insurrection, recent survey data from the University of Chicago reveal alarming and dangerous levels of support for political violence and conspiracy theories across the United States. The university’s Chicago Project on Security &amp; Threats (CPOST) research center has been conducting Dangers to Democracy surveys of American adults on political violence and attitudes towards democracy since shortly after the January 6 attacks. In new data from April shared exclusively with the Guardian, researchers found a continued support for violence to achieve various political goals on both sides of the aisle, and a general distrust for democracy. The results are particularly alarming as the 2024 election approaches without essential safeguards that some lawmakers say could help prevent another violent attack on US democracy. For the next year and a half through the 2024 election, CPOST will be releasing new survey data tracking continued dangers to democracy every three months. The data will be published first with the Guardian. This data will be critical at a time when efforts to erode democracy feel increasingly prevalent in the United States, from candidates who deny the results of their elections to governmental taskforces attempting to prosecute people who unintentionally violate voting laws. “We’re heading into an extremely tumultuous election season,” said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs CPOST. “What’s happening in the United States is political violence is going from the fringe to the mainstream.” The most recent survey from April 2023 found that an estimated 142 million Americans believe that elections won’t solve America’s most fundamental problems – up from 111 million last September. And one in five American adults still believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, representing very little change from 2021. “What you’re seeing is really disturbing levels of distrust in American democracy, support for dangerous conspiracy theories, and support for political violence itself,” Pape said. Pape said it was important to track sentiments about political violence, comparing it to the kindling for a wildfire. Though many were unaware that the events on January 6 would turn violent, research shows that public support for violence was widespread, so the attacks themselves should not have come as a surprise. “Once you have support for violence in the mainstream, those are the raw ingredients or the raw combustible material and then speeches, typically by politicians, can set them off,” he said. “Or if they get going, speeches can encourage them to go further.” Before the January 6 insurrection, there was chatter on online forums and among far-right groups about potential political violence when Congress met to count electoral votes and certify Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election. But it was Trump’s speech at the White House Ellipse that day that touched off the actual violence, Pape said. That’s why it’s important to track public sentiment about political violence regularly. The instigating event, usually a speech or comment by a person in power, is unpredictable and can set people off at any moment, but the underlying support for violence is more predictable and trackable. The survey found that almost 14% – a minority of Americans, but still a significant number – believe the use of force is justified to “achieve political goals that I support”. More specifically, 12.4% believe it’s justified to restore the federal right to abortion, 8.4% believe it’s justified to ensure members of Congress and other government officials do the right thing, 6.3% think it’s justified to preserve the rights of white Americans, and 6.1% believe it’s justified to prevent the prosecution of Trump. Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University and the author of a forthcoming book on public trust in the military, said that while public support for political violence might seem extreme, a confluence of factors is necessary for actual violence to occur – which is still rare. On January 6, there was a time-sensitive action, an already existing rally, and inciters including Trump who encouraged others to commit violence. “You needed all of that at the same time to turn what would have been latent sentiment of the sort that this survey captures into actual violence,” he said. In addition to wide support for Trump’s big lie about the 2020 election, the survey also found that significant numbers of American adults believe conspiracy theories about the US government, and the number of believers has remained steady over almost two years. For example, 10% of American adults in April said they believe the government is run by Satan-worshipping pedophiles. “The survey confirms what we already knew, which is that rhetoric is really hyperbolic in American political life,” Feaver said. “You can get folks to express support for pretty extreme statements.” An even greater percentage of American adults said they believe in the “great replacement” theory, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that holds there is an active effort to replace white people with non-white populations, including immigrants and other people of color, in white-majority countries. While much of the survey reveals an alarming level of political polarization in the United States, there are areas where the majority of people do agree. Almost 55% of American adults feel like elections won’t solve our most fundamental political and social problems, and close to 50% believe political elites on both sides of the aisle are the most corrupt people in America. Perhaps more optimistically, the largest share of Americans believe in a potential solution to political violence. More than 77% think Republicans and Democrats in Congress should make a joint statement condemning any political violence. “There’s a tremendous amount of opposition to political violence in the United States, but it is not mobilized,” Pape said.

Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” the Ukraine president said. “In the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from Kherson. The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports the city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Russia also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims, arguing its soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian soldiers killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was “aware of the videos” and was “looking into them”. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. “We have offered Poland support in securing airspace – with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,” Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon’s Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson remains without electricity, running water or heating, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Emmanuel Macron has accused Russia of feeding disinformation to further its “predatory project” in Africa, where France has had military setbacks. In an interview with TV5 Monde on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. Macron said: “A number of powers, who want to spread their influence in Africa, are doing this to hurt France, hurt its language, sow doubts, but above all pursue certain interests.” Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-14T06:24:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 325 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog announced it would boost its presence in Ukraine to help prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it would soon have a permanent presence at all five of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Currently, only the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant, which is near the frontline, has a permanent IAEA presence. Ukraine has denied Russia’s claim that Putin’s forces have captured Soledar. On Friday, Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the salt mining town. Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting “ongoing battles”. Soledar is ‘Verdun for 21st century’ according to a top Ukraine official. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, likened the fight for the town to the longest and bloodiest battle in the first world war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar. The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town. Ukraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly, a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour. Germany will continue to “weigh every step carefully” and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its “leading position” as one of Kyiv’s top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on “such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jun/01/elena-rybakina-harnesses-power-to-continue-title-challenge-at-french-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-01T19:37:00Z","webTitle":"Elena Rybakina harnesses power to continue title challenge at French Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/01/elena-rybakina-harnesses-power-to-continue-title-challenge-at-french-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jun/01/elena-rybakina-harnesses-power-to-continue-title-challenge-at-french-open","fields":{"bodyText":"Deep into the second set of Elena Rybakina’s French Open second round match against Linda Noskova, a routine day on-court nearly became complicated. Having faced minimal problems throughout, Rybakina threw in a series of unforced errors on her serve while leading a set and 3-3. She quickly found herself down double break point. Few players in the world today are as adept as Rybakina at navigating tough service games and emerging with a hold. Under pressure for the first time, the Kazakhstani found a couple of searing backhands and a couple of big serves, saving three break points in total. Rybakina held serve and then she broke immediately. Shortly after, she reached the third round with a 6-3, 6-3 win. This season, the Wimbledon champion’s all-surface rise has been one of the most notable developments. After winning at Indian Wells and reaching finals at the Australian Open and Miami, she closed off a fortnight on slow, damp clay courts in Rome as the unlikely winner of the Italian Open. Rybakina is the first women’s player since Serena Williams in 2015 to simultaneously hold titles at WTA 1000 level and above on hard, clay and grass courts. Her success is driven by her first serve, one of the most devastating shots in the sport. Rybakina is the WTA’s ace leader, averaging 7.9 aces per match, and her 73.9% of first serve points won places her second on the tour this year. For Noskova, the pressure of holding on to her own serve was immense. Rybakina’s serve has long been a massive weapon but she continues to make small adjustments. This season, she made a small change to her service motion in search of a more consistent delivery: “It’s just trying to get more serves with the same motion, to get this power and just the timing, I would say. So it’s nonstop work,” she said, smiling. There are ample players with immense power and weapons, but few are able to harness their power consistently. Rybakina’s success is as much down to the patience and control she has learned to play with, attacking big targets and punishing opponents with her weight of shot rather than directly aiming for lines. It also remains one of her biggest challenges. She said: “Sometimes I feel like: ‘OK, the ball is quite easy, and I can go for it,’ but at these moments I need more patience. Not every ball, even if it looks like you can really attack and move in, because especially here, the conditions are a bit different. It’s not easy to finish the rally. You need to come forward. This is something we’re still improving.” This year marks the French Open’s second year of incorporating night sessions into its daily schedule, a result of its lucrative partnership with Amazon Prime. Unlike at other tournaments, the night sessions consist of only one match and they are reserved exclusively for men’s matches. It is a complicated discussion; the disparity in treatment between the men’s and women’s is blatant, but the men’s best-of-five-sets format is better suited to one-match tickets in terms of length. In reality, one-match night sessions are a bad idea in general. Not only are they the worst value ticket in tennis, but few players like to compete in cold clay-court conditions late into the night. Since night matches are broadcast on Amazon Prime rather than France Télévisions, the free-to-air national broadcaster, the audience is considerably lower. After her comfortable 6-4, 6-0 win over Claire Liu, Iga Swiatek noted that while she remains in favour of women receiving the same opportunities as men, she has been requesting day sessions. “My thoughts didn’t really change,” she said, “but honestly, I have to tell you that I kind of requested every day to play a day session because I felt like I played already night sessions in this clay court swing.” With Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas all occupying the top half of the men’s draw, Daniil Medvedev’s first-round defeat by Thiago Seyboth Wild has left the bottom half extremely open, with opportunities for those remaining. It became even more open as Jannik Sinner fell to Daniel Altmaier, the world No 79, 6-7 (0), 7-6 (7) 1-6, 7-6 (4) 7-5 after five hours and 26 minutes on Court Suzanne Lenglen, the longest and most dramatic match of the tournament. First Sinner failed to serve out the match and missed two match points at 5-4 in the fourth set, then it took Altmaier five match points to close out the tense, exhausting battle. As Altmaier sat down and took in the achievement, the crowd chanting his name, he wept. The top seed in the bottom half is the No 4, Casper Ruud, who defeated Giulio Zeppieri 6-3, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, while Holger Rune, seeded sixth, was the beneficiary of a walkover after Gaël Monfils’ withdrawal. In the bottom quarter, however, the 12th seed, Frances Tiafoe, and the 15th seed, Borna Coric, head the field. The third round of the women’s singles will see a fascinating teenage battle between the 16-year-old Mirra Andreeva, who eased through with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Diane Parry, and Coco Gauff, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Julia Grabher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/aukus-nuclear-submarines-australia-commits-substantial-funds-into-expanding-us-shipbuilding-capacity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T20:08:22Z","webTitle":"Aukus: nuclear submarines deal will cost Australia up to $368bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/aukus-nuclear-submarines-australia-commits-substantial-funds-into-expanding-us-shipbuilding-capacity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/aukus-nuclear-submarines-australia-commits-substantial-funds-into-expanding-us-shipbuilding-capacity","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia is to embark on one of its most significant, expensive and geopolitically consequential military tasks in a century: the push to acquire, operate – and eventually build – nuclear-powered submarines. The program is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period, and will depend on help from the US and the UK. As part of the multidecade nuclear-powered submarine plan unveiled on Tuesday, Australian taxpayers will pour “substantial” funds into expanding American shipbuilding capacity, understood to be about $3bn in the first four years. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between the three countries, as he joined the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the announcement in San Diego. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. He said his government was “also determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our region”. In a bid to reassure partners across the Indo-Pacific, Biden said it was important to note the Australian submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed. “I want to be clear from the outset – right off the bat – so there’s no confusion or misunderstanding on this critical point,” Biden said. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state, and it’s committed to stay that way.” Australia would invite “rotational forces” of US and UK submarines to visit the country from 2027. The first Australian-built nuclear-powered submarines, fitted with vertical launch systems to fire cruise missiles, are due to enter into service in the early 2040s. The British-designed submarine “will incorporate US technology such as propulsion plant systems and components, a common vertical launch system and weapons”, an Australian government fact sheet said. “The Aukus partners will also develop a joint combat system as an expansion of the US-Australia combat system.” The plan begins with increased visits by US submarines to Australian ports this year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup From 2027 at the earliest, the UK and the US plan to establish a rotational presence of one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines at HMAS Stirling near Perth, Western Australia. This will be called “Submarine Rotational Force-West” (SRF-West). The Australian government argues this rotational presence “will comply fully with Australia’s longstanding position of no foreign bases on its territory” because these submarines will be rotated through the location and will not be permanently based in Australia. The three countries argue the rotational presence will “put our nations shoulder to shoulder as Australia builds the necessary operational capabilities and skills to steward and operate its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines”. The US and UK submarines would operate as sovereign assets under the command of, respectively, American and British commanders, but there would be “a significant degree of coordination in their activities”, a senior Biden administration official said. Beginning in the early 2030s, the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed, pending approval from the US Congress. The three governments argue this is “critical to continue growing Australia’s ability to own and operate” a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and to ensure Australia does not experience any capability gap when its Collins class diesel-electric submarines are retired from the 2030s. The Australian government still plans to extend the life of some of these six conventional submarines, but the Aukus plans means it may not be necessary to carry out expensive upgrades on all of them. The third phase of the program involves the design and construction of a submarine to be known as the “SSN Aukus”, to be based on a UK design but incorporate US technology – as the Guardian foreshadowed last week. “Australia’s long-term submarine will be a state-of-the-art platform that uses the best of US, UK and Australian technologies,” the official said. “SSN Aukus will be built and deployed by both Australia and the UK. The United Kingdom intends to deliver its first SSN Aukus domestically in the late 2030s. Australia intends to deliver the first SSN Aukus built in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s. “This is going to require significant improvements in industrial bases in all three countries.” Senior Biden administration officials said the budget commitment from Australia towards the US industrial base was “another manifestation of just how serious and critical this effort is”. The $3bn would help the US reduce work backlogs on its own Virginia class submarines, and expand its production ability. The funding for US domestic production could be a point of tension in Australia at a time when the budget is facing pressure on multiple fronts. The projected cost includes includes $9bn over the initial four-year budget period, or an increase of $3bn compared with the $6bn earmarked for the abandoned French project. Defence is being asked to offset that $3bn, which could come through changes to other defence projects. Australian officials believe it is hard to estimate the cost over the life of the program, but have predicted a range based on all costs including acquisition and sustainment. The long-term cost of the submarine plan is likely to be about 0.15% of Australia’s gross domestic product per year on average, compared with Labor’s pre-election overall pledge to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence annually. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, earlier offered bipartisan support to the overall Aukus deal, saying it is “truly a multigenerational nation-building task for the Australian people” and that it “cannot fail”. Hastie also acknowledged the Aukus project would require some “hard choices” in the budget because “money doesn’t grow on trees”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T10:50:32Z","webTitle":"Situation at Zaporizhzhia plant ‘perilous’, UN warns | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said yesterday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on 9 March, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. What else is happening? President Vladimir Putin’s ally Dmitry Medvedev has said this morning that any attempt to arrest Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for him would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. US navy rejects China claim that warship ‘illegally’ entered part of South China Sea The US has denied Chinese claims that a US destroyer was driven out from waters around the contested Paracel Islands after it “illegally” entered the area in the South China Sea. In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese military said the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius illegally intruded into China’s territorial waters without the approval of the government, undermining peace and stability in the busy waterway. The US navy, however, said this was false. “The USS Milius is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea and was not expelled. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” a statement from the US Navy 7th Fleet said. Where are the Paracel Islands? They are a disputed archipelago spread across about 7 sq km in the South China Sea. China has de facto control of the islands and has built installations and outposts, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim ownership. What did the US say? The US’s Indo-Pacific Command at the time said China’s statement was “false” and that the US ship was conducting a freedom of navigation operation (Fonop) in line with international law. The Fonop sought to challenge restrictions imposed by various parties – including China, Taiwan and Vietnam – on “innocent passage” through the disputed area, and to challenge China’s claim of straight baselines that enclose the Paracel Islands. Trump lawyer ordered to hand over notes in Mar-a-Lago documents inquiry Donald Trump’s main lawyer – who was involved in turning over classified-marked documents at the Mar-a-Lago resort to the justice department last year – must provide his notes and audio transcripts to the criminal investigation into the former president after a federal appeals court rejected two efforts to block the order. The US appeals court for the DC circuit rejected on Wednesday two separate appeals from the former president and his lawyer Evan Corcoran to stop a sealed order, piercing attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine protections issued in a court decision last week. In losing the appeal – a major defeat for Trump – Corcoran must provide additional testimony and produce documents to the grand jury hearing evidence about Trump’s potential unauthorized retention of national security materials at Mar-a-Lago, and possible obstruction of justice. The obstruction part of the investigation is centered on Trump’s incomplete compliance with a subpoena in May that demanded the return of any classified-marked documents in his possession. That was after documents he returned earlier to the National Archives included 200 that were classified. What is happening in the Dominion case? The full trial in the case is scheduled to begin on 17 April but one side may have won already, argues Sam Levine. The core of Dominion’s $1.6bn case against Fox consists of words that came from the mouths of Fox’s employees. Regardless of what happens in the case, Dominion may have already won: the messages offer a significant historical record of how top officials at one of the country’s most powerful media organizations aired information they knew was false when US democracy was under attack.

Stat of the day: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates a quarter-point amid banking turmoil Facing the worst banking crisis since 2008 and the highest inflation rate in a generation, the Federal Reserve chose to keep fighting price rises and announced another hike in interest rates. The US central bank announced yesterday that its benchmark interest rate would rise another quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% – its ninth consecutive rate rise and the highest rate since 2007. A year ago interest rates were close to zero. The latest increase was smaller than the half-point increase that some had expected before a series of bank collapses shook global markets. In a statement, the Fed said the impact of the banking crisis was “uncertain” but that inflation “remains elevated”.

Climate check: new climate paper calls big US oil firms to be charged with homicide Oil companies have come under increasing legal scrutiny and face allegations of defrauding investors, racketeering and a wave of other lawsuits. But a new paper argues there’s another way to hold big oil accountable for climate damage: trying companies for homicide. The striking and seemingly radical legal theory is laid out in a paper accepted for publication in the Harvard Environmental Law Review. In it, the authors argue fossil fuel companies “have not simply been lying to the public, they have been killing members of the public at an accelerating rate, and prosecutors should bring that crime to the public’s attention”. “What’s on their ledger in terms of harm … there’s nothing like it in human history,” said David Arkush, one of the paper’s authors.

FAS published a photograph of a device being inspected for damage by US soldiers, including two from an explosive ordnance disposal unit, and a civilian. The rear of the device appears to have been twisted by an impact and one of the tail fins is missing. There is pink sticky tape covering an apparent hole. The picture was included in a 2022 presentation for student job applicants by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, one of the country’s nuclear weapons facilities, and it geolocated the image to the Volkel air force base in the Netherlands, one of six bases in five European countries where a total of 100 B61 nuclear gravity bombs are being stored as part of a nuclear-sharing agreement with the US. A FAS blog by Hans Kristensen, the director of the FAS nuclear information project, said it was unclear whether it was a real bomb or a training model. The US air force in Europe and LANL would not comment on the photograph, but on Monday, after publication of Kristensen’s blog, the Pentagon said it was a dummy weapon being used as part of a training drill. “At every military facility, we have a response team that has to train together, and that is what this was, and the photo was put in a recruitment manual,” Oscar Seára, a Pentagon spokesperson, said. A spokesperson for the US air force in Europe would not comment directly on the photograph, but said: “The US maintains the highest level of standards for personnel and equipment supporting the strategic arsenal, which includes routine training, maintenance and security activities, to safeguard America’s critical capabilities. “It is US policy [that] we can neither confirm nor deny the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any general or specific location, including specific exercise or real-world operations. The Los Alamos National Laboratory said in an emailed statement: “No additional information is available for that photo.” The B61 bomb is the only tactical nuclear weapon left in the US arsenal, and 100 of them are stored in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. The bombs remain US property, but aircrews from six other Nato allies (the five hosts plus Greece) are trained to put them on planes and fly them. In the event of hostilities, it would require the agreement of the US, the Nato nuclear planning group and, by dint of the history of the arrangement, the UK prime minister, for the weapons to be transferred to allied planes. Such nuclear-sharing operations are practised each year in Nato’s Steadfast Noon exercise, most recently in November, and since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has asked to be part of the arrangement. Arms control advocates have long argued that the B61 is militarily obsolete and should be withdrawn from Europe as an easy step towards disarmament. The Obama administration contemplated its withdrawal, but met with resistance from some European allies, who saw it as symbolic of the US nuclear umbrella protecting them, and the idea was dropped altogether following Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Instead, the weapon was modernised and the new version, the B61-12, is due to be delivered to Europe. In November, C-17A transport planes were given safety approval to carry B61-12 nuclear bombs, and Kristensen noted that a C-17A plane flew from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Volkel airbase a week ago, though he cautioned that did not prove that it was carrying B61-12 bombs. “The B61 bomb is about as safe as a fully assembled nuclear weapon can be. It has good safety mechanisms and insensitive high explosives that won’t detonate if exposed to fire, shock, shrapnel, etc,” said Eric Schlosser, the author of Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety. “The warheads routinely trucked from the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Berkshire to the Trident submarine base on the west coast of Scotland are a lot more problematic. You could get significant plutonium scattering or even a small-scale nuclear detonation during an accident or a terrorist attack – and those warheads are also more vulnerable to sabotage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/16/thailand-election-will-move-forward-be-able-to-claim-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-16T05:30:04Z","webTitle":"Thailand election: will Move Forward be able to claim power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/16/thailand-election-will-move-forward-be-able-to-claim-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/16/thailand-election-will-move-forward-be-able-to-claim-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The election in Thailand ended with an unexpected result: the triumph of progressive, anti-military party Move Forward. But due to Thailand’s electoral system, the party still faces a tricky path to claiming power. So, what happens next? Who won Thailand’s election? Move Forward - a young, progressive opposition party - stunned many observers by winning 14.2m votes, more than any other party, and sweeping all but one seat in Bangkok. It had campaigned promising to remove the military’s influence from politics to make the country more democratic, break up the big monopolies that dominate the economy, expand the welfare system, modernise the school curriculum, scrap mandatory conscription, and – most sensitive of all – reform the strict lese majesty law that shields the king from criticism. The party is hugely popular among young people, and its success reflects changing societal values and attitudes towards power structures and key institutions. Pheu Thai, a heavyweight opposition party associated with the ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, came second. It had hoped for a landslide, and this is the first time in 20 years that it has not won the most seats in a general election. The ruling former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in a coup, performed poorly. Move Forward and Pheu Thai have said they will form a coalition along with other opposition parties, however they face major hurdles. Why is it so difficult for the winning party to form a government? Thailand’s future prime minister is voted on not just by the House of Representatives, whose 500 members were determined by Sunday’s election, but also by the unelected Senate. All 250 senators were appointed by the military after the last coup and they are generally seen as part of the conservative establishment that protects the political status quo. Move Forward’s policy platform, especially its pledge to reform the lese majesty law, could be a major block that means many senators will not allow Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat to become prime minister. When will parliament vote on the next prime minister? A joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be held in July to select the new prime minister. Move Forward has said that, with its planned coalition, it would have 309 seats in the House of Representatives. This is short of the 376 that is needed for Pita to become prime minister. Pita said on Monday that he was not concerned about the Senate voting against him, and appeared to almost dare senators to defy the popular vote. “It is the consensus from the people, which every side should accept. Resisting the consensus will be of no benefit to anyone,” he said. Are things over for Prayuth Chan-ocha? The election delivered a damning verdict to Prayuth, and he said on Sunday night that he respected democracy and that he hoped Thailand “will be peaceful and prosper”. He still technically has enough seats to be in the running for prime minister, though it would be difficult for him to sustain a minority government. But even if Prayuth’s political career is over, the conservative royalist military establishment that he represents remains incredibly powerful, and there are various mechanisms that can be used against its opponents. This includes not only the Senate but also the courts. Move Forward’s predecessor, Future Forward, which also promised reform and performed well in the 2019 election, was dissolved just one year later. Shutting down political parties is a common trend in Thailand, a country that is prone to military coups. Since 2006, nine political parties have been dissolved - including not only Future Forward, but also predecessors of Pheu Thai. A complaint has already been filed against Pita with the election commission, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied wrongdoing. What has Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat promised? Pita said on Monday that he wanted to form a government as quickly as possible to avoid a power vacuum. “The sentiment of the era has changed,” he said of his election success. “People have been through enough.” He wanted Thailand to become “fully democratic” and decentralised, “with an economy that works for everybody not just the 1% on top”, and an ability to be flexible and adjust to new challenges – such as climate change or pandemics. He also said he favoured “rules-based diplomacy”, and that it was not acceptable for bigger states to bully smaller countries. Thailand should stick together with mid-size countries, he said, and contribute to stability in the region. He said he wanted to push for progress in a regional five-point plan that was created, and has so far failed, to resolve the crisis in neighbouring Myanmar, which is engulfed in conflict between the military junta and pro-democracy opponents. He also said he wanted to created a humanitarian corridor between Thailand and Myanmar – which would be a stark shift in policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T01:00:02Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: Japan insists release of 1.3m tonnes of ‘treated’ water is safe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Almost 12 years have passed since the strongest earthquake in Japan’s recorded history resulted in a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along its north-east coast. As the country prepares to mark the 11 March anniversary, one of the disaster’s most troubling legacies is about to come into full view with the release of more than 1m tonnes of “treated” water from the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The tsunami knocked out the plant’s backup electricity supply, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors, in the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. Much has changed since the Guardian’s first visit to the plant in 2012, when the cleanup had barely begun and visitors were required to wear protective clothing and full-face masks. Atmospheric radiation levels have dropped, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced and robots have identified melted fuel in the basements. But as the Guardian learned on a recent visit, progress on decommissioning – a process that could take four decades – is being held up by the accumulation of huge quantities of water that is used to cool the damaged reactor cores. Now, 1.3m tonnes of water – enough to fill about 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools – is being stored in 1,000 tanks that cover huge swathes of the complex. And space is running out. Two steel pillars protruding from the sea a kilometre from the shore mark the spot where, later this year, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], plans to begin releasing the water into the Pacific Ocean, in the most controversial step in the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup to date. The decision comes more than two years after Japan’s government approved the release of the water, which is treated using on-site technology to remove most radioactive materials. But the water still contains tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. The discharge, which is due to begin in the spring or summer, will take place in defiance of local fishing communities, who say it will destroy more than a decade of work to rebuild their industry. Neighbouring countries have also voiced opposition. The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. Tepco and government officials who guided a small group of journalists around Fukushima Daiichi this month insisted the science supports their plans to pump the “treated” water – they object to media reports describing it as contaminated – into the ocean. The water will be treated and, if necessary, treated again until the concentration of radionuclides other than tritium have fallen below government limits, said Hikaru Kuroda, a Tepco official overseeing the decontamination and decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi. “By the time the liquid is diluted with seawater, tritium levels will be at less than 1,500 becquerels per litre, or 1/40th of the government standard for discharging water into the environment,” he said. “We will have contaminated water on the site for as long as we have to cool the reactor basements. And we will release the water very slowly to begin with, so we could be looking at something like 20 to 30 years to complete the process.” The fiercest opposition has come from Fukushima’s fishers, who say releasing the water risks destroying their livelihoods because consumers will shun their catch and send prices plummeting. “Even though it is safe, it could still harm sales of Fukushima seafood and lower prices, which is what happened 12 years ago,” conceded Junichi Matsumoto, Tepco’s chief officer for the management of treated water. “We know fishing communities are worried … that’s why we and the government are working on addressing the potential reputational damage.” The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the strictest in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs such as meat and vegetables is 100 becquerels a kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. While officials attempt to reassure the public and other countries that Fukushima produce is safe for consumers, Tepco and the government have embarked on a PR offensive, holding regular briefings on the water discharge for Tokyo-based diplomats and journalists, and running ads on TV, in newspapers and online. “We take other countries’ concerns seriously, which is why we are using every possible opportunity to explain the discharge plan to them,” said Ayako Ogino, a foreign ministry official. “We have made a commitment to discharge the water without harming the environment or human health. To describe the water as contaminated is erroneous, as it implies that it will harm the environment.” The campaign has had mixed results. South Korea and China have voiced opposition to the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) said recently it had “grave concerns”. Environmental groups have challenged the Japanese government’s claims that the water will not affect marine life or human health, while the US National Association of Marine Laboratories has pointed to a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data to support its reassurances on safety. The water release plan received a boost this month, however, when Micronesia, a member of the PIF, dropped its opposition to the water discharge. Its president, David Panuelo, said in Tokyo that his country was “no longer fearful or concerned about this issue now as we trust in Japan’s intention and technological capabilities in not harming our shared oceanic interests”. Japanese officials have ruled out other options, including long-term storage underground or evaporation, and insist nothing will stand in the way of the discharge plans. “The biggest obstacle to decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi is the debris [inside the reactors],” said Atsushi Wakui, a nuclear accident official at the economy, trade and industry ministry. “Securing the site so we can begin removing the melted fuel is absolutely essential, and that means urgently addressing the water problem. There are more than 1,000 tanks of water here, and they need to go.” • This article was amended on 20 February 2023 to clarify that concentrations of radionuclides other than tritium will be treated and, if necessary, retreated until they have fallen below government limits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/09/a-long-overdue-moment-the-uk-greens-pushing-for-the-nuclear-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T15:00:25Z","webTitle":"A long overdue moment?

Greens in Finland would now campaign not only for the lifespan of current reactors to be extended but also for new plants, with the technology recognised by their manifesto as “sustainable energy”. It was a decision that upended decades of environmentalist orthodoxy – by campaigners who, in many cases, cut their teeth in opposition to nuclear. And, for Tea Törmänen, it was the culmination of years of campaigning. She and others in the Finnish Greens for Science and Technology group had argued that only through the adoption of nuclear power and other technologies could human societies decarbonise fast enough to avert climate breakdown. Writing later, the biologist, who is also a former chair of Finland’s Ecomodernist Society, said: “For me it was a moment that was long overdue.” As anxiety grows over the extent of climate and ecological crises, fear for the future is loading an ever more desperate calculus in favour of radical action. For some, this could include environmentalists embracing technologies previously regarded as unacceptable. But could Britain’s green movement go nuclear? Last month, Törmänen was in a London meeting with UK activists to see if it can. RePlanet are the pro-nuclear, pro-GMO vegans who have come to shake up the environmental movement. Newly formed of an international network of pro-technology environmental campaign groups, they believe doubling down on technology and progress is the key to solving the climate and ecological crises. Now, with funding from climate philanthropists, they are spreading out from a core in northern Europe with a plan to “pivot the mainstream” across the continent. But their proposals look set to put them on a collision course with traditional environmentalists. In a video fronted by the environmental campaigner and Guardian columnist George Monbiot they have entreated the public to go vegan, calling for animal products to be replaced by fats and proteins grown in genetically modified microbial soup. In Germany they are campaigning for the government to end its phase out of nuclear power and in Finland and the Netherlands they have helped guarantee the industry’s future. At the EU level they successfully argued that nuclear should be included in its taxonomy of green energy sources, while at the same time campaigning against the bloc’s organic farming targets and longstanding ban on genetically modified crops. They have hired two seasoned activists, Joel Scott-Halkes and Emma Smart, to manage their UK campaign. With backgrounds in Extinction Rebellion, both have proven themselves committed to radical climate action. Scott-Halkes went on to join radical vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion, while Smart’s activism with Insulate Britain earned her spells in jail. A third British campaigner, the environmental writer Mark Lynas, a former staunch opponent of GM who reversed his views, is a co-founder. RePlanet has its roots in a network of “ecomodernist” groups and societies established since 2015, after the publication of An Ecomodernist Manifesto. That document, signed by Lynas among others, upended traditional environmentalist philosophy. Instead of calling for humans to live in harmony with nature, for degrowth and moderation, the ecomodernists double down on technology as a means to minimise the human impact on Earth, while providing for a population of billions. Land sparing lay at the core of the manifesto, with the aim of rewilding as much of the world’s surface as possible by concentrating human activities. Ultimately, they wrote, technology could “decouple” economic growth from planetary systems, and the “wise” use of nuclear power, genetic modification and intensive agriculture would lead “to a good, or even great Anthropocene”. Activists in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere took up the charge. But in the UK, reception to the ecomodernists was frosty. Summing up criticisms at the time, Monbiot said ecomodernists “would wish away almost the entire rural population of the developing world”, and they had failed to interrogate the relationships between modernity and proletarianisation, uneven development and poverty. After a botched attempt to reach out across the political spectrum by teaming up with Owen Paterson, a Tory former environment secretary, Lynas admitted attempts to launch the movement in the UK had amounted to a “screw-up of impressive proportions”. Now he is playing a key role in trying to revive ecomodernism. RePlanet, Scott-Halkes explained, had been born out of a process of “rebranding ecomodernism”, jettisoning bits of the philosophy that had “become problematic”. Over the past two years, he said, they had worked together with Monbiot to embed into their approach a critique of power. Where previously ecomodernists had been seen as naively pro-capitalist and pro-technology, RePlanet believe they have faced up to the nuances and dangers of the technologies they are proposing – and the dangers of progress in general. Like classic ecomodernists, they see themselves as “pro-science and evidence-based” supporters of prosperity, who embrace progress, said Scott-Halkes. But there is a new emphasis on development and, befitting its sojourn in social democratic northern Europe, a new faith in “the power of the democratic state to take control of technologies, to develop technologies”. Precision fermentation and nuclear power are emblematic of the kinds of technical fixes they call for. Precision fermentation could, they claim, allow for the entire world’s protein to be produced from an area the size of London. It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the world’s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be “open sourced” to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town. “We’re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,” said Scott-Halkes. “If this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, we’re actually genuinely screwed.” Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. “Nuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,” Scott-Halkes said. “It is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.” Finland is the “gold standard” of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the party’s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finland’s parliament, such policy decisions have force. In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. Critics of precision fermentation argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed. Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanet’s Reboot Food campaign on Twitter as “akin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroids”. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming. “But they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,” he said. “I think it’s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.” Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanet’s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. “Nuclear is the opposite,” he said. “The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.” Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanet’s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the group’s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment. “I broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we can’t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,” Monbiot said. “We have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.” RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marx’s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthers’ vision as “almost as austere as Pol Pot’s”. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UK’s Novara Media news website have advocated for “fully automated luxury communism”, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastani’s debut book. Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO2 capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk. Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity. But it increasingly looks as though it may be the one we will get."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jun/04/cristiano-ronaldos-topsy-turvy-saudi-sideshow-upstaged-by-power-of-nuno","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Cristiano Ronaldo’s topsy-turvy Saudi sideshow upstaged by power of Nuno","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/04/cristiano-ronaldos-topsy-turvy-saudi-sideshow-upstaged-by-power-of-nuno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/04/cristiano-ronaldos-topsy-turvy-saudi-sideshow-upstaged-by-power-of-nuno","fields":{"bodyText":"When Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr announced the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo in late December, their Instagram following jumped from less than 1 million to almost 15 million. On the pitch, despite Ronaldo’s best efforts, the Riyadh club slipped from first when he arrived to finish second in May as Nuno Espírito Santo led Al-Ittihad to a first championship since 2009. This move was always about much more than football but there was plenty of that to talk about. A first league title as a coach for the former Tottenham and Wolves manager means his Portuguese compatriot will have to wait until next season for the chance to add to the seven domestic championships won with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. That campaign may look very different and not just because the top tier will expand from 16 to 18 teams. More big names are on the way. Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Karim Benzema – as well as coaches such as José Mourinho and Zinedine Zidane – are all being linked with Saudi Arabia. Once such speculation would have been dismissed, but things have changed. “To have such players come, then the Saudi players will see a different mindset and approach from the top stars in the way they prepare,” says Roel Coumans, coach of the Saudi league club Abha. “To come to Saudi and believe it is easy is a big mistake, the league is very strong and the standard is definitely improving.” Ronaldo, who is reportedly being paid about £175m a year until June 2025, scored 14 goals in his 16 league games as Al-Nassr tried to keep pace with the relentless Al-Ittihad. While the performances of the 38-year-old could be described as good rather than great, compared with some foreign players in Asia – (Carlos Tevez described his time in Shanghai in 2017 as a “holiday” and certainly treated it as such) – Ronaldo’s commitment to the cause was there for all to see, as was his frustration with himself, teammates and even coaching staff when things were not going to plan. “When you are that age and in this kind of shape then you will be an example to others,” Coumans said. “He has always had this kind of mentality and always wants to win.” That did not always happen, though there were highlights. A delicious curling shot from the edge of the area to complete a fightback victory over Riyadh rivals Al-Shabab in May rolled back the years. There was also a rare free-kick success. Despite such moments, Al-Nassr struggled to build momentum. Anderson Talisca was the leading goalscorer when Ronaldo arrived, an attacker who also wants the ball at all times. The Brazilian and the Portuguese never quite clicked and it was noticeable that when Ronaldo missed the last game of the season through injury, Talisca scored two and made one in a 3-0 win. Others seemed to benefit. Abdulrahman Ghareeb noticeably improved alongside the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. “It is very difficult to play with a player of the talent and stature of Ronaldo,” the winger said. “It is not possible to predict what he will do in the match but I am happy to play with him and keen to learn and improve my level.” In April, Rudi Garcia, the coach, left after rumours of a row with Ronaldo and other players over tactics. In came Dinko Jelicic as interim coach but the Croat made little impact. There was turmoil behind the scenes, with reports of Musalli al-Muammar resigning as club president. “We know how effective Ronaldo is but he is just one player,” said Jana Mohammed, an Al-Nassr fan. “If you check lots of fans’ opinions, they are not satisfied with the management, that is who we are annoyed with.” Off the pitch, Al-Nassr became one of the most talked-about clubs in the world and their yellow and blue shirts are now familiar, especially as the league sold broadcasting rights to almost 40 territories. Regardless of accusations of sportswashing, Saudi Arabia’s aim is to become a global sporting hub sooner rather than later with growing involvement in international football and other major events such as Formula One, golf and boxing. In football, the 2027 Asian Cup is already confirmed, there is an official bid for the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup and there are reports of a World Cup bid coming soon, possibly along with Egypt and Greece. “We have to choose the right time: 2030 or 2034?,” said Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, president of the Asian Football Confederation, in May. “If our chance of hosting the tournament is better in 2034, we are looking into that, and if our conditions in 2030 are better, why not?” Hosting rules would need to be changed for another Asian country to host in 2030, only two tournaments after Qatar 2022. Ronaldo, with more than 560 million followers on Instagram, is another factor. Crotch-grabbing aside (an apparent reaction to rival fans shouting “Messi” at him as he left the field after a derby defeat in April, though Al-Nassr said it was a reaction to a groin injury), he has done and said the right things and been pictured participating in Saudi Arabian life with his Arabic-speaking children. Reports in the Europe that he is unhappy in the country are confidently dismissed by club officials. His comments, first when on international duty in Portugal in March and then to Saudi television in May, that he believed the league could become one of the best five in the world may have raised European eyebrows but went down very well at home. Whatever the international ranking, Al-Ittihad are the best domestically. Under Nuno, the Jeddah giants deserved a first title since 2009. Conceding 13 goals in 30 games and losing twice was impressive. As well as the tight defence, the Moroccan striker Abderrazak Hamdallah collected his third golden boot in the country with 21 goals. “There are basic principles in my life that conflict does not solve problems so I deal peacefully with players,” said Nuno who instilled a new mental strength into a team that threw away a 16-point lead in the previous season. “If they did not believe in themselves then this title would have been impossible and it is the players who made it possible.” Ronaldo could not quite make Al-Nassr’s dreams possible on the pitch but off it, he has taken the club’s profile as well as the league’s to a new level. He says he is not finished yet. “Next season will be even better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"£50m fund will boost UK nuclear fuel projects, ministers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","fields":{"bodyText":"A £50m nuclear fuel fund to bolster production in the UK and support development of alternatives to Russian supply opens for applications on Monday, the business department has announced. The fund forms part of a nuclear fuel investment package of up to £75m, of which up to £13m has already been awarded to the nuclear fuel fabricators Westinghouse in Preston, helping the company develop conversion capability for reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium. Uranium conversion is an important stage in the nuclear fuel cycle. The funding is designed to create capability to convert recycled uranium in the UK that is not currently available outside Russia. As well as strengthening UK energy security, ministers hope it will also open up new export opportunities. G7 leaders agreed in June to take collective action to reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including diversifying their supplies of uranium and nuclear fuel production capability. Russia owns about 20% of global uranium conversion capacity and 40% of enrichment capacity. Graham Stuart, the energy and climate minister, said: “Record high global gas prices, caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted the need for more homegrown renewable energy, but also UK-generated nuclear power – building more plants, and developing domestic fuel capability. “This investment package will strengthen the UK’s energy security, by ensuring access to a safe and secure supply of UK-produced fuel to power the UK nuclear fleet of today and tomorrow – squeezing out Russian influence, while creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.” Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Having the sovereign capability to manufacture next-generation nuclear fuels for advanced reactors of the future is vital for energy security and net zero.” The £50m fund will support projects such as fuel supply options for light water reactors, including future small modular reactors. It will also look to support projects producing new fuel types that will be needed to supply advanced modular reactors, likely to be in operation from the 2030s, such as high-assay low-enriched uranium. The news comes after the government confirmed in late November that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk will go ahead, backing the scheme with an investment of nearly £700m that will end China’s controversial involvement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/apr/17/scottish-power-caused-me-distress-after-my-fathers-death","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power caused me distress after my father’s death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/17/scottish-power-caused-me-distress-after-my-fathers-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/apr/17/scottish-power-caused-me-distress-after-my-fathers-death","fields":{"bodyText":"I am contacting you in desperation about the serious problems I am having dealing with Scottish Power after the death of my father last year. When I notified it of AJ’s death back in September it closed his account and promised a cheque for his credit balance would be posted to me. This eventually arrived in November but was made payable to “Miss AJ”. My father’s bank accounts are frozen and he was never a “Miss”, so I requested a replacement made payable to me and sent to my address (I live more than five hours drive from my dad’s flat). I was promised a new cheque would be issued, which it eventually was, but again it was made payable to “Miss AJ” and sent to his address! When I closed his account, a new one had been set up called “executors of AJ”, with me as the named contact. However, even though the company knew he had died, I received emails addressed to “Dear AJ” which I found very upsetting. The farce continued when it sent a £127 refund cheque for the executors account, which was double the amount owed. However, as it was made payable to “executors of AJ”, and there is no bank account with that name, it was useless. It then sent payment demands for the overpayment, even though I had not been able to pay the cheque into a bank account. Eventually, after being threatened with debt collection and credit default notices, I paid the amount it claimed was due, so they now owe me more money. It has also since emerged that the executors’ account was closed the day after I opened it, and another account set up in my name, at his address, with bills based on estimated usage sent to the unoccupied flat. I only discovered this when I started to get payment demands, including texts from debt collectors. However, when I supplied the meter readings the account was £71 in credit. I have lost count of the hours I have spent writing emails, on the phone and writing up notes in an attempt to keep track of progress with the different accounts. I raised a complaint in November last year and in January I asked for it to be escalated. But I am getting nowhere. On the basis of the statements and correspondence, Scottish Power still owes my family about £365 and I feel that some acknowledgment of its failings is warranted given the impact on me after the loss of my father. MJ, Monyash The ineptitude displayed by Scottish Power in handling the closure of your late father’s account at times borders on parody. To send cheques to your father’s female alter ego not once, but twice, as well as sending emails addressed to him, is distressing. But to then chase you for money that you do not owe is shocking. The good news, however, is that with our help this sorry saga is now finally over. Scottish Power says: “We’re very sorry for the distress and frustration MJ experienced, and the unacceptable delays in resolving this for him at such a difficult time. This is not the standard of customer service we aim to provide.” It continues: “We cancelled all previous cheques and sent him cheques issued in his name and to his address, covering the final credit balance owed. “We refunded the energy bill support payments he was entitled to for his late father’s property, and remained in touch to ensure the cheques were received and cashed before closing the accounts concerned. “We then agreed and issued a goodwill payment in recognition of the distress caused.” After some wrangling it increased its compensation offer to £500, which your family has accepted. You are glad it is finally all over but feel that by repeating mistakes, such as issuing useless cheques to “Miss AJ”, it demonstrated considerable incompetence and insensitivity. It made you glad to receive an apology and a level of compensation that you think begins to reflect the seriousness of its failures in this case. To you, it seemed that Scottish Power’s procedures and systems for dealing with the death of a customer had been designed with a level of incompetence comparable to Basil Fawlty. The hope here is that by highlighting your experience, other people dealing with the loss of a loved one will have a better experience. Let’s hope so.

London Irish have finally followed Worcester and Wasps in being kicked out of the league, the financial mess that engulfs club rugby growing deeper. Again it is a tale of broken promises, of misplaced hope that salvation was round the corner. The figures alone are haunting. Upwards of £30m of debt, approximately 70 players unemployed. But the numbers do not speak of the devastation that accompanies the demise of a professional club. Nor the depressing inevitability of something that has been on the cards for months, writ large in recent weeks, or the powerlessness to stop it. The reasons behind Irish’s demise are different to that of Worcester and Wasps but no less chilling. Worcester’s problem was their co-owners; Wasps’ what can be described, with hindsight, as a ludicrous bond scheme. What will terrify those in the corridors of power in regards to Irish’s downfall is that it was due to a benefactor who had supported the club for the last decade but either could not or would not continue to do so. It is terrifying because here is an illustration of just how precarious it can be to live at the mercy of a wealthy owner initially willing to absorb losses. Take Bath as an example. Bruce Craig is said to have pumped a few more million into the club and Finn Russell’s arrival will be greeted with great fanfare. But what of Bath if Craig pulls the plug? The same goes for Bristol if Steve Lansdown decides it is time to get out. Likewise Tony Rowe at Exeter. Newcastle, on the other hand, have been criticised for slashing their budget and with it their ambition. At times the criticism is justified – their capitulation at home to Northampton in the penultimate round of the season was pathetic – but at least they are trying to live within their means. If the first draft of the next Professional Game Agreement does not spell out instructions as to how clubs must address their debt – exacerbated by Covid recovery loans – and that their central funding is conditional on it, then it should be ripped up and thrown in the bin. That the government has stepped in by appointing two independent advisers to assist with the restructuring of the domestic game only reiterates the gravity of the problem. At Irish, just as at Worcester and at Wasps, it is the human cost that is most sobering. The employees who are now out of work, who have given years, decades, to the club. In terms of the playing squad, the cream will be swiftly picked off – Tom Pearson has an array of suitors, so too Henry Arundell and the highly rated Chandler Cunningham-South. But what of the lesser-heralded players? Not all will find employment in what is already a crowded market. That the players and staff agreed to an extension to the Rugby Football Union’s deadline, primarily to ensure that they at least received some of May’s wages, is a damning indictment of the landscape. Irish’s owner, Mick Crossan, has his supporters after picking up the club a decade ago, for absorbing losses year on year, for relocating them to the capital and for continuing an upward trajectory. Much of that goodwill has been lost in recent weeks. As well as being given the ultimatum of only being paid 50% of May’s wages in order to keep the club afloat, staff and players were also paid April’s wages late. To put the burden on the players is to tug at the heartstrings. At the start of May, Irish’s director of rugby, Declan Kidney, reminded us it was a club with a 124-year history, with amateur roots in Sunbury in Surrey, also a club with a community feel. It is that sort of emotion that clouds judgment when it comes to the proposed takeover by a US consortium. Take it away and all that’s left is an investment that makes little business sense. Granted the Hazelwood training base is an impressive asset, but Irish do not own their stadium and have tens of millions of pounds of debt. Simon Massie-Taylor, chief executive of Premiership Rugby, has inherited a lot of problems of his predecessors’ making and has approached them with commendable intent, but it was naive in the extreme to remark of Irish’s prospective buyers that “they’re from across the pond and they’ve got interest in other sports so it is a positive news story”. He is not the first to be seduced by Uncle Sam but will now have to set about accelerating plans for a 10-team Premiership. The desperate shame is that Irish have made great strides on the pitch this season. Kidney deserves great credit for that; he is an experienced hand with an unflappable nature who will have protected his squad from the turmoil as best he could. There is a wealth of talent in the squad, too, and if the aim was to spend big on players such as Waisake Naholo, Adam Coleman, Sean O’Brien and Curtis Rona as the cohort of English talent that includes Pearson and Arundell emerged then it nearly worked. The fanbase in Brentford has also grown – more than 11,500 attended their final match of the season – but ultimately it is another moonshot to crash and burn. For its part the RFU has not known whether to stick or twist as the echoes with Worcester and Wasps have grown louder in recent weeks. On one hand there has been a desperation to avoid losing a third club from the Premiership in the space of eight months; on the other the union has to be firm after its chief executive, Bill Sweeney, was skewered by a parliamentary inquiry in November. Irish’s suspension will only heap the pressure on Sweeney, whose public appearances have dried up in recent months. He is under pressure over his planned governance reforms and the botched handling of the tackle height law change. There is also understood to be an anticipated £40m shortfall in the RFU’s income, alongside a further projected £10m loss due to inflationary costs, such as those related to overheads. The next Professional Game Agreement – which comes into force next year – may be Sweeney’s intended parting legacy but, in truth, he may not even get that far. If he does, then addressing the Championship – whose funding was slashed on his watch – must be among his priorities. It is absurd to think the Championship can come to the rescue for so many players out of work when it is not funded properly. If there is a glimmer of hope it is that cut-price year-long deals in the second tier or France, before the Premiership salary cap goes back up to £6.4m, may be the least bad option for many players. But that several clubs believe raising the salary cap again is madness, given the current climate, only goes to highlight the depth of the quagmire English rugby is in. As one well-placed source lamented: “What is the vision, can the RFU give us a concrete vision for what English rugby looks like?” Until it does, the worry is that London Irish will not be the third and last to fall. For now there are 10 green bottles sitting on the wall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2023/jun/04/too-few-people-in-power-really-care-about-those-with-disabilities","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T15:36:04Z","webTitle":"Too few people in power really care about those with disabilities | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/too-few-people-in-power-really-care-about-those-with-disabilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/jun/04/too-few-people-in-power-really-care-about-those-with-disabilities","fields":{"bodyText":"Frances Ryan suggests that disabled people in Britain are viewed more as a burden than human (A decade after the Tories demonised disabled people on benefits, it’s happening again, 30 May).

Ministers took a £100m option to invest in Sizewell C’s holding company in January and said on Tuesday it would convert that into equity if the project reaches a final investment decision. The venture on the Suffolk coast is jointly owned by EDF and China General Nuclear Power. The government is understood to be keen to remove CGN from the project amid concerns over China’s involvement in critical UK infrastructure. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out the taxpayer-funded financing model for Sizewell C and future projects on Tuesday. The strategy the government plans to use – a regulated asset base model – is commonplace in infrastructure projects and involves taxpayers taking on risk alongside private investors. The government is attempting to inject urgency into a notoriously slow-moving industry amid a drive to boost Britain’s domestic energy supplies. In April Boris Johnson set out plans to approve up to eight reactors by the end of the decade. A decision on whether to grant Sizewell C planning consent was last month delayed until 8 July. Research by the University of Greenwich Business School seen by the Guardian last month showed the project could cost UK taxpayers more than double government estimates and take five years longer to build. Details of the financing model released by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy failed to list the cost to consumers or the return on government investment. The government said Kwarteng was “satisfied” that the project would represent value for money. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “It’s outrageous that ministers are hiding the cost to electricity bill payers and the public purse of Sizewell C, while claiming to be transparent. By redacting the finances, it is impossible to know if the secretary of state’s judgment on value for money is sound.” Sizewell C will sit in a new company that will qualify for a government bailout if it goes bust. EDF’s Hinkley Point C plant has had significant delays and rising costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/apr/29/leinster-toulouse-champions-cup-semi-final-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T16:28:01Z","webTitle":"Leinster exploit Toulouse indiscipline to power into Champions Cup final ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/29/leinster-toulouse-champions-cup-semi-final-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/apr/29/leinster-toulouse-champions-cup-semi-final-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"The procession continues. No matter that the visit was of mighty Toulouse, the only club with a richer pedigree in this competition, Leinster march into the final of the Champions Cup as if it were the most natural, obvious cadence to an already stellar season. Whether it is in the green shirts of Ireland or the blue of their province, these players have yet to be beaten this season. Toulouse are not quite so closely a mirror of their national team, but they include France’s best. This might represent a sobering afternoon for more than just France’s most successful club side in this, the year of their home World Cup. Toulouse opened and closed the try-scoring, but in between they conceded five tries, four of them when down to 14 men. Leinster in Dublin, which they have been and will be throughout the knockout stages, is one thing, but offer them gifts on the discipline front and not even the aristos of the Haute-Garonne stand a chance. A yellow card for Thomas Ramos in the first half and Rodrigue Neti, the replacement prop, in the second were all the invitation the hosts required. No team is as ruthless against a disadvantaged opponent. Jack Conan scored twice while Ramos was away to take Leinster into a 20-7 lead at the end of the first quarter, which Dan Sheehan improved the moment Ramos was back. In the second half, Leinster’s pick-and-drive routine was overpowering, after Neti senselessly went for Josh van der Flier with his head and was fortunate in the current climate to see only yellow. Van der Flier scored from the lineout set up by that indiscretion. When Jean Cruz Mallía, almost as senselessly, offended at a ruck, Jason Jenkins’s charge at the line proved one too many for Toulouse after the subsequent lineout. Both Conan scores in the first half also came from lineouts, at which James Ryan, captain in the absence of Johnny Sexton, ruled appropriately. Conan’s owed more to sleight of hand and timing of pass than the power plays of Leinster’s second-half scores. These Irish can play it every which way. Sheehan’s try, Leinster’s third just shy of the half-hour, owed to a mix-up between Paul Graou and Jack Willis, but what a finish, the hooker beating Antoine Dupont and Ramos for pace. Every which way indeed. The presence of Graou in the first place told another story. Toulouse arrived with the very French tactic of a 6-2 split on the bench, which can work under the right circumstances. These include not losing a back to injury in the first half. Pierre-Louis Barassi was forced off in the 15th minute, prompting a reshuffle. Graou came on at scrum-half, and Dupont and Romain Ntamack each shifted out one. This allowed Dupont to develop the roving brief he plays so well at the best of times. For a while, towards the end of the first half, it threatened to work when Manny Meafou scored Toulouse’s second, following a quickly taken penalty by Graou. But Toulouse’s indiscipline was their biggest problem. Ramos’s yellow card for a knock-on deemed deliberate might have been contestable, but if you are going to go for those interceptions with a man clear outside, you had better be sure. Otherwise, Toulouse could not win a break with the referee Wayne Barnes, their first penalty awarded beyond the half-hour mark, by which time they had conceded six. Which is a shame, because when they can play, few do it so beautifully. Their opening try, the game’s first, was slick and apparently effortless, those maestros in the back division putting Pita Ahki over before the first 10 minutes was out. Their try at the death, Willis guiding home a driven lineout of their own, showed they can play it slow and remorseless too. It’s just that when it comes to multidimensional rugby, there is no one to compare with the Irish at the moment. Leinster will take on La Rochelle or Exeter with confidence in the final in Dublin in three weeks. Then their Ireland contingent, which is nearly all of them, will turn their minds to France again towards the end of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/16/chinese-official-asks-if-australias-aukus-nuclear-submarines-intended-for-sightseeing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T06:59:25Z","webTitle":"Chinese official asks if Australia’s Aukus nuclear submarines intended for ‘sightseeing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/chinese-official-asks-if-australias-aukus-nuclear-submarines-intended-for-sightseeing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/16/chinese-official-asks-if-australias-aukus-nuclear-submarines-intended-for-sightseeing","fields":{"bodyText":"A Chinese embassy official asked Australian officials during an Aukus briefing whether the nuclear-powered submarines were intended for “sightseeing”, according to multiple sources. Guardian Australia understands several others in the room found the intervention curious, because the Australian government has made no secret of the fact the nuclear-powered submarines are to be used by the Royal Australian Navy. The comment was made during a briefing held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Wednesday at which dozens of representatives from other diplomatic missions were also present. It is believed to have been made in the context of Beijing’s longstanding claims that the Aukus deal is a breach of either the letter or spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). One source said a Chinese official at the briefing said words to the effect of: “What are these boats for? Sightseeing?” A second source confirmed a comment about “sightseeing” had been made. It is unclear whether the comment was made sarcastically. The Chinese embassy has been contacted for a response. The Australian government declined to comment. Dfat has conducted multiple briefings sessions this week for diplomatic missions in Canberra, including specific events for south-east Asia and another for Pacific island countries. The Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, was not in attendance at Wednesday’s briefing but this was not unusual because most countries were represented at a lower level than their heads of mission. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup China’s participation in the briefing is a point of interest given the strength of Beijing’s reaction to the Aukus submarine plans from the moment they were unveiled by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego on Tuesday morning. Australia, the US and the UK argue the NPT regime expressly allows for the transfer of naval nuclear propulsion technology, although they acknowledge this is the first time such a transfer has been made from a nuclear weapons state to a non-nuclear weapons country. The Aukus partners say they are committed to negotiating a rigorous verification and safeguards package with the International Atomic Energy Agency to set the strongest possible precedent. China, however, has argued such transfers should only be for peaceful uses. China – a nuclear weapons state – has put nuclear non-proliferation concerns at the centre of its international campaign against Aukus, knowing that these issues have resonance in south-east Asia and the Pacific. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said this week that the Aukus countries were trying to “coerce the IAEA secretariat into making safeguards exemption arrangements, which would seriously undermine the authority of the body”. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, rejected that argument on Thursday. “I do not accept those assertions,” Wong said during a press conference in Adelaide. “Australia has an impeccable record when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation, an impeccable record, and we intend to maintain that.” Asked whether the Aukus deal would only further strain ties between Canberra and Beijing, Wong said the announcement had been “a long time coming” and the region was “very well aware of it”. Wong said Australia’s intention was “to help keep the peace, to help keep stability”. “Australia doesn’t seek to dominate the region, Australia seeks to ensure we contribute to a region that is stable, peaceful, secure, prosperous and in which sovereignty is respected,” she said. The Dfat briefings were intended to reassure countries across the region – and farther afield – about Australia’s intentions. It comes as Australia seeks to begin formal negotiations with the global nuclear watchdog on a safeguards arrangement. Australia has sought negotiations under an existing deal it has with the IAEA, known as the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has explained that article 14 of that agreement allows Australia to use material for “a nuclear activity, such as nuclear propulsion for submarines, provided that Australia makes an arrangement with the agency in this regard”. The Australian government is believed to disagree with this provision being characterised as a “loophole” and has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the nuclear-powered submarine program. Grossi said that in negotiations with Australia, the IAEA would be “very demanding” and would insist that its inspectors be allowed to check the amount of nuclear fuel in the sealed units before and after the submarines put out to sea. Grossi told reporters that some countries had “strong feeling” about Aukus but added: “Nobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA.” Albanese said on Thursday his government would continue to invest in diplomacy, as he rejected heavy criticism by the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating about the Aukus deal. “The relationship with China is improving and that is a good thing,” Albanese said. The prime minister met members of the Chinese-Australian community at an event in the Victorian seat of Aston, where a by-election is due to be held on 1 April. He said: “We’re sending a message to this community that we represent as a government every community, regardless of where you are from, [and] that we understand that Australia’s diversity is a strength.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/08/benjamin-grosvenor-review-virtuosic-pianist-schumann-ravel-prokofiev-busoni-bach","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T11:50:20Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Grosvenor review – pianist’s virtuosity preferences power over pastel colours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/08/benjamin-grosvenor-review-virtuosic-pianist-schumann-ravel-prokofiev-busoni-bach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/08/benjamin-grosvenor-review-virtuosic-pianist-schumann-ravel-prokofiev-busoni-bach","fields":{"bodyText":"Judging from the near-capacity audience for his recital, and the enthusiastic reception for it, Benjamin Grosvenor is now firmly established as one of Wigmore Hall’s favourites. His latest programme – works by Busoni, Schumann, Ravel and Prokofiev – contained none of the virtuoso showpieces that used to be such a regular feature of his recitals, though there were still plenty of technical challenges of the kind that he takes in his stride. Le Tombeau de Couperin was perhaps the nearest thing to purely decorative music in the selection, though Grosvenor’s take on Ravel’s piano music is never as pastel-coloured and exquisite as it’s sometimes presented, but something much more sinewy and direct, even in these exercises in nostalgia. He would return to Ravel for his encore, too, with Jeux d’Eau, in a performance that owed as much to Liszt as it did to any notion of musical impressionism. But a first half of Busoni’s transcription of the great Chaconne from Bach’s D minor violin Partita, and Schumann’s C major Fantasie Op 17 was powerful stuff. The Chaconne was a tremendous opener, given a performance of immense muscularity and power that swept all before it, and that intensity was carried over into the Fantasie. That work needs a bit more than sheer power though, and at times Grosvenor’s reading would sometimes have benefited from more transparent textures and a less assertive bass and even a little more affection in its lyrical interludes, while the treacherous closing pages of the central march were not quite as immaculate as one might have expected from such a technically gifted pianist. But Prokofiev’s Seventh Sonata, the central panel in his wartime sonata triptych, received exactly the fierce, driven performance it demands, only pausing for breath in the slow movement, with its allusions to a song from Schumann’s Op 39 Liederkreis, and Grosvenor’s virtuosity didn’t miss anything in the final, tumultuous toccata."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T07:27:14Z","webTitle":"Australia seeks talks with global nuclear watchdog to allay Aukus fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government has requested formal talks with the global nuclear watchdog to allay any concerns Aukus could lead to undeclared nuclear activities in Australia or the diversion of enriched uranium.

The Chinese government has demanded that the IAEA “not have consultation with the three countries on the so-called safeguards arrangements for their nuclear submarine cooperation”. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the Aukus countries were trying to “coerce the IAEA secretariat into making safeguards exemption arrangements, which would seriously undermine the authority of the body”. The argument was amplified by state-run outlets, including the China Daily, which suggested Australia could not credibly ask Iran or North Korea to give up their nuclear ambitions. The new letters from Wong and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, emphasised that Australia was not seeking nuclear weapons, but instead was acquiring “conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”. Albanese assured the IAEA’s director general, Rafael Grossi, that Australia would “meet our safeguards obligations and nuclear non-proliferation commitments at all times”. “Australia understands this initiative is a serious undertaking: we will be responsible stewards of naval nuclear propulsion technology,” the prime minister wrote. “I would welcome a visit to Australia by senior IAEA representatives in 2023 to continue consultations with Australian officials.” Albanese said he also hoped to welcome Grossi back to Australia “at a mutually convenient time”. Grossi met Albanese during his visit to Australia in July and said at the time he was “absolutely confident” about the country’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. But Grossi also described Aukus as “a technologically challenging project that will require very specific arrangements between us and Australia”. The planned negotiations boil down to a single article in a longstanding deal between the IAEA and Australia, known as the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. In a statement acknowledging the letters, Grossi explained that article 14 allowed Australia to use material for “a nuclear activity, such as nuclear propulsion for submarines, provided that Australia makes an arrangement with the agency in this regard”. Grossi vowed to navigate the serious legal and complex technical matters “in an independent, impartial, and professional manner” and said the IAEA “must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project”. The Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office has also written to the IAEA with “preliminary design information”. Indonesia’s foreign ministry said it expected Australia to “develop with the IAEA a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said China should not “lecture us” on Aukus. He said China was pursuing “the biggest peacetime military expansion since the second world war, which includes nuclear weapons”. “There’s a lot of disinformation out there and we have made a modest investment into our military capability relative to theirs,” Hastie said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T14:00:25Z","webTitle":"Tech coalition aiming to create Australian high-powered laser industry with nuclear fusion ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","fields":{"bodyText":"A coalition of technology companies intend to create a high-intensity laser industry in Australia, with potential applications including nuclear fusion. It follows reports of an expected announcement from the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that researchers have managed to get more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. The coalition, led by the Australian laser fusion company HB11 Energy, also includes the University of Adelaide, the Institute of Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the Japanese laser fusion firm EX-Fusion, and the French engineering multinational Thales Group. It aims to develop an ultra-high intensity laser facility in Australia, with petawatt (one quadrillion, or one million billion watts) lasers. Dr Warren McKenzie, founder and managing director of HB11 Energy, said Australia was one of few developed countries without such a facility, adding that high-powered lasers could be used for energy generation through nuclear fusion. “The same lasers can be used, for instance, for the transmutation of fission radioactive waste – essentially reducing the half-life of radioactive waste from hundreds or thousands of years to tens of years,” he said. McKenzie also described the reported US fusion result as arguably “one of the biggest developments in energy science this century”. National Ignition Facility researchers have reportedly produced more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than what was put in – a milestone known as net energy gain. In a development yet to be confirmed by the NIF, scientists are reported to have shot high-power lasers at a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium – both isotopes of hydrogen – inside a metal capsule. “Lasers both heat the fuel … but they also compress it to much higher than its natural density, and the combination of the increase in density from the compression and the heat is what triggers fusion,” McKenzie said. Prof Ken Baldwin of the Australian National University described the NIF’s apparent advancement as “a truly groundbreaking achievement”, but said it was unlikely fusion power would “save us from climate change”. “All the heavy lifting for the energy transition will be done by renewable energy and nuclear fission (existing nuclear power) – with nuclear fusion at commercial scale unlikely to be available until later this century, well after the 2050 deadline needed to keep global warming below two degrees. But beyond that, fusion might provide limitless energy for centuries to come,” Baldwin said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mark Diesendorf, an associate professor and deputy director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales, agreed that fusion was “decades away from any possibility of commercial electricity generation”. “There’s a huge gap between this experiment – which I really would hesitate to call a breakthrough – and what has to be done to get commercial electricity out,” he said. “There’s an intense pulse of laser radiation for a tiny fraction of a second. Then the question is: during that tiny fraction of second, did they get more fusion energy out than they put in?” Diesendorf said. “To generate electricity, what you’ve got to do is to have thousands and thousands … perhaps millions of these pulses a day successfully getting more energy out. And then you’ve got to capture that energy.” Diesendorf also warned of the risk of nuclear proliferation, pointing out that the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the fusion breakthrough was made, is a nuclear weapons research facility. “Fusion produces neutrons and neutrons can be used to transmute elements – so you can get nuclear explosives such as plutonium-239 and uranium-233 and uranium-235,” Diesendorf said. “You can also produce lots of tritium … an essential component of nuclear bombs in missiles.” McKenzie said HB11 was the first modern private fusion company to demonstrate fusion involving lasers, and that unlike the NIF, it was not using tritium as fuel, but boron. “When we produce fusion, it doesn’t create any radiation or radioactive waste,” he said. HB11 is still “four orders of magnitude” away from achieving net energy gain. McKenzie said the firm was able to generate 0.01% of the energy input in its fusion reactions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:15:02Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","fields":{"bodyText":"What is the significance of this power plant? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world. It has six reactors, each generating 950MW, and a total output of 5,700MW, enough energy for roughly 4m homes. In normal times it produces one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity and almost half the energy generated by the country’s nuclear power facilities. The plant is located in south-east Ukraine in Enerhodar on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km south-east of Kyiv. What happened on Friday morning? A fire broke out in a training building outside the plant in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. The first report came from an employee at the plant, who posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 2.30am, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.” He called for an immediate ceasefire to allow firefighters to control the blaze. A short time later, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the plant were “normal”. It reported that the fire was in a building outside the power plant. They later reported that the third power unit at the plant was disconnected at 2.26am, leaving just one of the plant’s six units, unit four, still operating. Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further. Is there a radiation threat? Ukrainian authorities on Friday morning said the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. The US also said their latest information showed no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant. The US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the reactors “are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, 100km north of Kyiv. Some analysts noted the Zaporizhzhia plant is of a different and safer type to Chernobyl, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release are low, said Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. He said the pressurised water reactors were “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete containments and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors,” he said. “The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside.” “These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they’ve got a passive system, they’ve got high-pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems.” • This article was amended on 4 March 2022. Tony Irwin was referring to the concrete containments, not “contaminants” of the PWR reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/may/05/revealed-royal-family-has-power-to-censor-bbc-coronation-coverage","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T17:51:01Z","webTitle":"Revealed: royal family has power to censor BBC coronation coverage ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/revealed-royal-family-has-power-to-censor-bbc-coronation-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/revealed-royal-family-has-power-to-censor-bbc-coronation-coverage","fields":{"bodyText":"The BBC has allowed Buckingham Palace to veto what footage it can use in its coronation coverage, raising questions about the national broadcaster’s impartiality in relation to the monarchy. In recent days the BBC has submitted material to the palace for approval in royal-themed programming, only for Buckingham Palace to declare certain pieces could not be used, according to individuals with knowledge of the situation. “The balance of the power is a little bit more with the royal household than the BBC at the moment,” said one source at the broadcaster, who said negotiations over the terms of the BBC’s coronation coverage were still ongoing just hours before proceedings were due to begin. The BBC is leading global coverage of the event, with its footage of King Charles in Westminster Abbey to be shared with other news channels around the world. This has led to fears at rival broadcasters that they have to trust the BBC’s editorial calls over what can be shown during the formal church service. A BBC spokesperson said: “We are focused on delivering great coverage and don’t recognise any characterisation that suggests we ever compromise our editorial integrity on any of our output.” The BBC’s coronation coverage is being run by Claire Popplewell, who oversees royal events for the corporation. Earlier this year she was made a commander of the Royal Victorian Order by the king in recognition of her work producing the BBC’s coverage of his mother’s platinum jubilee. Membership of the Royal Victorian Order is given to those who have served the monarch. Unlike most other honours, which are awarded on the recommendation of the government, recipients of this award are personally selected by the sovereign. Popplewell, who was described by a BBC source as “currently one of the most powerful people within the BBC”, helps manage the broadcaster’s relationship with the palace. To confuse matters, she is employed by the corporation’s for-profit BBC Studios commercial arm. This had led to a split between the BBC’s public service news division, which has a more stringent editorial code, and the BBC Studios team who are producing the coverage that will go out on BBC One. The BBC spokesperson said: “The programmes are produced by BBC Studios and commissioned by the BBC and there are many individuals involved in the conversations and decisions about what content makes the final broadcast programmes.” There are already indications of the royal household choosing what can be seen by the public. King Charles has vetoed the televising of his anointment by the archbishop of Canterbury, according to the Times. This means the public will not be able to watch as holy oil from Jerusalem is poured from a golden container shaped like an eagle into a 12th century “coronation spoon” before being spread on Charles’s head, breast and hands. This is not the first time the BBC has allowed the palace to have control over royal footage. The Guardian has previously revealed how the palace vetoed particular pieces of footage from Queen Elizabeth II’s memorial services, banning them from being reused in news reports and social media clips. Royal staff had a WhatsApp group during the proceedings in which senior executives from the BBC, ITV and Sky News were told which footage could be used. A member of the royal household would send a message every five minutes, either approving or refusing the use of the previous block of video. After the funeral had finished the broadcasters were allowed to submit an hour-long tape of highlights which they could reuse in future, with use of any other material requiring signoff from the palace. The veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby, who took part in the BBC’s coverage of the queen’s funeral, later confirmed the story. In an appearance at the Henley literary festival he described being surprised by the “degree of control” exercised by Buckingham Palace over the footage of the funeral. “There was this complete list of things that no broadcaster could show because the copyright belongs to Buckingham Palace. I think that’s wrong, just wrong. It’s just interesting how tightly controlled monarchy is.” He also suggested that topics such as the royals’ tax affairs are “never touched by the BBC because I think they feel their viewers will not like it”. The National Union of Journalists this week passed a motion raising concerns about the palace’s veto over royal footage. They express concerns “that a public event, paid for by the people and televised for them to be able to pay their respects should be censored in even a small way”. It came as the BBC found itself in a last-minute standoff over the “restricting” of British news outlets’ ability to access footage by charging high fees. The corporation’s decision to charge media companies for what the industry calls pool footage was decried as “perverse” by its rivals, who said it would stop the public from witnessing key moments of the historic day. A statement from the newspaper industry body News Media Association said: “Given the historic significance of the occasion, all efforts should have been made by the BBC to ensure that the footage, which is created using licence fee-payer money, is distributed as widely as possible to allow UK citizens to witness this event, and the BBC has not fulfilled this obligation. “The decision to charge UK media companies an excessive commercial fee (with no visibility of true costs) seems perverse when the BBC is allowing foreign publishers and broadcasters the same footage for free.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-18T19:00:19Z","webTitle":"Spectre of Maralinga hangs over Aukus nuclear waste for Indigenous communities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","fields":{"bodyText":"Behind all the pomp of the Aukus submarine deal in San Diego there was a detail that could prove a much bigger obstacle than even the massive USS Missouri moored near the three leaders. Under the agreement, Australia will be responsible for storing high-level nuclear waste from the decommissioned reactors. And that is no easy feat. The US and UK naval reactors that will power both the Virginia-class subs and the future SSN-Aukus boats are fuelled by highly enriched uranium-235. Once removed and decommissioned, any spent fuel from naval reactors is usually reprocessed to extract usable nuclear fuel for civilian generation and the remaining radioactive waste concentrated. The Australian government has promised not to reprocess spent fuel, which means it will probably be sent offshore. Overseas, the process typically involves extracting usable fuel such as uranium and plutonium, and then vitrification, in which radioactive waste is concentrated and melted down into a “big glass block” weighing tonnes, according to Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales. “It’s actually a very small volume, but it is extremely radioactive,” he said. After this complicated and hugely expensive process has been completed, there remains one big question – where will this waste be stored? Nuclear reactor fuel yields high-level waste, which is not only more radioactive. “When you have high-level waste, it is actually physically hot, so [you] need to think about thermal management as well,” Burr said. As some experts have pointed out, Australia has not even found a permanent site to store low-level nuclear waste, let alone highly radioactive waste. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup So far, the government has not given any details on that other than the defence minister, Richard Marles, saying it will be on land that is either owned by the defence department or to be acquired in future. Marles also said this won’t need to be solved until well into the 2050s. But that is not enough to satisfy many Indigenous communities, who fear the prospect of high-level nuclear waste dumps on traditional lands, and for whom the spectre of British nuclear testing in the 1950s and 60s still looms large. In South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula region, a proposed storage facility near Kimba for low-level nuclear waste has faced staunch opposition from traditional owners, as well as environmentalists and farmers, despite a ballot supported by about 60% of residents conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation chair, Jason Bilney, said the Barngarla people had not been consulted, opposed the plan and had been in a legal battle with the federal government against the proposal. He said he believed any storage of high-level nuclear waste would not be suitable in that area given the lack of granite and rock to hold the toxic waste, which could take hundreds of thousands of years to break down. “The ground is dirt,” he said. “High-level stuff needs to be stored and contained within the solid rock formation and Kimba doesn’t have that.” Bilney said many traditional owners in the region had a deep distrust and fear of defence testing and nuclear waste after the nuclear weapons testing conducted by the UK in Maralinga. The tests caused many of the local Anangu Pitjantjatjara people to suffer from radioactive illnesses, with elders and family sickened and the land contaminated. Bilney said his grandfather, who was from the Maralinga area, always remembered the trauma and the fear, which has continued through the generations. “That’s why I’m so strong and so passionate about being an advocate for my people and all Indigenous people,” he said. “There is still a big fear that that could happen again … It’s that generational effect and even now people are still passing away of cancers.” Bilney said while the bomb testing was not the same as storage of high-powered uranium rods, that fear remains. “It’s that generational effect. It’s people just dying from the effects of the atomic bomb and still suffering trauma. This is going to be stored into the earth. It’s going to destroy our way of life for us.” He said there was a real concern that storage of nuclear waste on traditional lands and any restrictions on access could harm the cultural and spiritual knowledge that had been passed down for thousands of generations. “It’s our biggest worry. We are the oldest culture for over 60,000 years and this is going to outlast it. “We want to pass down to the next generation and to continue this for decades to come to protect and preserve our sites and our storylines and that connection to country. And if they put it on country, we won’t be able to share that and we will lose those storylines. It will sever those ties.” One possible location could be a defence site within the Woomera region, an area spanning 122,000 sq km about 450km north-west of Adelaide. The area has long been used for nuclear testing and as a military base. The Woomera prohibited area takes in the traditional lands the Maralinga Tjarutja and Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yunkunytjatjara, as well as the Antakirinja Matu-Yankunytjatjara, Arabana and Kokatha. A Kokatha traditional owner and senior lawman, Andrew Starkey, said their traditional lands took in huge swathes from Ceduna to Woomera but that was not recognised by native title. “Our country is a huge bit of South Australia,” he said. “It starts from the Port Augusta region up to Woomera, around to Coober Pedy and through Tallaringa down around to the west coast, back around through to Whyalla – that’s traditionally Kokatha country. “Having to fight 20 years to be recognised over a piece of country that’s now going to be targeted to be used as a radioactive waste dump, we’re very concerned about this.” He said he was strongly against any proposed nuclear waste storage facility in any defence site in his traditional homelands. “We don’t want it and anyone with any common sense is going to say the same thing. We don’t want that in our back yard.” He said there were still defence testing sites in the remote desert, with unexploded ordinances, rockets and materials dating back decades – in 2021 an unexploded rocket was found near Lake Hart, a culturally significant site. “There’s a lot of historic waste that’s still lying around in the Woomera area from the very early days of when they were testing things. It’s bad enough that when we go out to our sites that we’ve got to dodge missiles that are lying around on our heritage sites.” The federal government has been contacted for response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/apr/28/soft-power-cardigans-male-status-symbol-sales-soar","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T11:18:23Z","webTitle":"Soft power: cardigans become male status symbol as sales soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/28/soft-power-cardigans-male-status-symbol-sales-soar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/apr/28/soft-power-cardigans-male-status-symbol-sales-soar","fields":{"bodyText":"Until recently, a man in a cardigan might typically have signalled “retiree”. But now the cosiest of knitwear items has been given a makeover. Fashion-friendly brands such as The Elder Statesman, Ami Paris and Studio Nicholson are pushing the cardigan. Marks &amp; Spencer reports that sales of cardigans are performing well for spring – up 90% on 2022, possibly due to the “inbetween” weather. A green “preppy” style is particularly popular. More styles will be launched by the retailer this autumn. If the quarter-zip jumper is a masculine status symbol worn by the likes of David Beckham, the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and those working in the City, the cardigan is increasingly about soft power. The Netflix series Beef provides a study in the soft power cardigan – thanks to the character George Nakai, played by Joseph Lee. If, early in the series, he appears to be a kind and gentle soul, he flexes his power as the plot unravels. The cardigans he wears – ostensibly the ultimate in non-threatening knitwear – allow him to hide in plain sight. They have gained a cult following in fashion. A recent GQ article with the headline “George from Beef is terrible but his cardigans are not” praised choices from brands including Needles, Dries van Noten and John Elliott. Lee’s Nakai isn’t the only example of the soft power cardigan on TV. In the latest episode of Succession, Roman Roy wears a cardigan to look unthreatening on a business trip to Norway, when he is anything but. Away from TV, celebrities have been adopting the cardigan including Brad Pitt and the Creed star Michael B Jordan. Crucially, these are not the quiet luxury takes on the item as worn by the Roys and their ilk. Pitt wore a multicoloured zipped-up cardigan that had a folksy feel, while Jordan recently favoured a pink V-neck style with a low-cut vest. Pedro Pascal – star of the Last of Us and the internet’s current crush – has anointed the soft power cardigan. He wore a cropped version on the red carpet, and an oversized flecked one for an appearance on Radio 1. It slots into his appeal perfectly, as described by The Face magazine: “[he’s] relatable, despite the fact [he’s] been launched into celeb super-stardom with the force of dynamite”. Gary Armstrong, the stylist and editor of CircleZeroEight, has long worn cardigans. He has noticed the take-up of the item recently and says it fits into the kind of statement young men want to make with their clothes now. “It is quite similar to the guys who have started to adopt pearl necklaces. It’s like, ‘I’m so in touch with my own masculinity that I’m not threatened in wearing like a floral cardigan.’” Thom Scherdel, the buying manager for mens ready-to-wear at Browns, has noticed more cardigans from more trend-led designers. “With multi-generational appeal, cardigans have always been a smarter alternative to casual knitwear,” he says. “However, recently, we’ve seen the style adapted by brands that have more directional style aesthetic and who have reimagined the classic shape.” Armstrong says the current vogue for men in cardigans was preceded by the grunge era – with Kurt Cobain a cardigan icon (the Nirvana frontman’s cardigan was sold at auction in 2019 for $334,000 [£267,000]). He applauds more men taking up the item. “A cardigan is a bit of a crossover thing – you could make it look smart if you’re wearing it to the office,” he says. “Also, it’s nice to be warm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/britain-to-build-nuclear-powered-submarines-for-historic-aukus-pact","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T21:42:09Z","webTitle":"Size of UK’s nuclear submarine fleet could double under Aukus plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/britain-to-build-nuclear-powered-submarines-for-historic-aukus-pact","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/britain-to-build-nuclear-powered-submarines-for-historic-aukus-pact","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet could double in size as plans were revealed for the new “Aukus” vessels to be based on a British design. In a bid to counter the growing threat from China, the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowed alongside his US and Australian counterparts to stand “shoulder to shoulder” to protect peace in the Indo-Pacific given its implications for security across the world. A “historic” deal 18 months in the making was announced by the three leaders in Point Loma, San Diego, that will see new Aukus submarines seaworthy from the late 2030s. They will be based on a British design, with some made in the UK by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce – principally in Barrow-in-Furness. The new submarines will replace the current seven nuclear-powered vessels used by the UK – but more could be added, taking the potential size of the fleet to 19. The Aukus security pact, which military top brass believe is the most significant for Britain since the US helped it become one of the few nuclear powers in 1958, will see Australia become only the seventh such country in the world to gain nuclear powered submarines. Australia expects to receive delivery of its own submarines in the early 2040s. In the mean time, British submarines will start to be rotated to Australia from as early as 2027 to build the country’s knowledge, workforce and infrastructure in preparation. This year, more senior Australian officers will start training on US and UK submarine bases, with the US hoping to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines and a further two if needed. China has sought to sow doubts about the project, arguing it would have a “grave nuclear proliferation risk” and could violate an international treaty. But the three Aukus countries said they had set the highest standard and worked closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency. For more than 60 years, they argued, the UK and US have operated more than 500 naval nuclear reactors that have collectively travelled more than 150m miles without incident. Speaking in California on Monday, Sunak, US president Joe Biden, and Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese vowed the move would contribute to “global security and stability”. In the face of concerns about growing military and economic hostility from China, the three leaders said in a joint statement: “For more than a century, our three nations have stood shoulder to shoulder, along with other allies and partners, to help sustain peace, stability, and prosperity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific. “We believe in a world that protects freedom and respects human rights, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the rules-based international order.” Quoting former US president John F Kennedy who visited San Diego and spoke of the importance of freedom, peace and stability in 1957, Sunak said the Aukus powers were “united by that same purpose”. He targeted China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, saying they threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Although Britain’s closest threat geographically is Russia, given its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, defence figures believe that the growing threat will emerge from China. If the ice caps in the Arctic continue to melt, there are concerns China’s surplus naval fleet could begin to operate on Europe’s doorstep. With Taiwan holding elections next year, some western countries fear that could provide the impetus for an attempt by China to seize control of the island. Aukus is not anticipated to create a domino effect – meaning it will probably remain a three-way trilateral relationship rather than bringing other countries into the pact. However, the UK government is confident it has captured the imagination of observers and hopes they will align with the Aukus objectives. That could include more military joint exercises, but go as far as prompting a re-think of relying too heavily on Chinese investment and trade ties. While Sunak said this week China posed an “epoch-defining challenge” to the world order, he has resisted classifying the country as a “threat” in the updated integrated defence review. The prime minister faced down hawks in his own party who want him to take a stronger approach, as he does not believe that deteriorating relations with Beijing are inevitable.

I came to philosophy through Simone de Beauvoir in the 1970s, and over the years have used her work to think about aspects of the secondary (and tertiary) status of so many people in society, in addition to women’s experience of being the second sex. One aspect of West’s article that struck me forcibly was the benefit of philosophy for the person. His account of understanding the nature of emotion in an unjust structure is vital to understand the “way things are”. However, it highlights the futility of acceptance as a response to change the causes of imprisonment of these young people, not to mention West’s own experience of the incarceration of his relations. Education has been emancipating and empowering for him, and will probably make a huge difference to the lives of his young students. But the ways in which education outside the prison context, as a social institution, fails them illuminates the need for social as well and personal transformation. And philosophy has to enable people to become agentic, not accepting – in the way The Second Sex, whatever its flaws, has done. Adult education has a long history and practice of making the personal political. This is particularly urgent in the light of the trend toward greater incarceration, rather than education, care and concern, which are ultimately cheaper than imprisonment.

Stokes had a cortisone injection into his troublesome left knee in March before he joined Chennai Super Kings for their Indian Premier League campaign, and he said on Wednesday that while “I don’t plan ahead too much” the treatment would be repeated “if needs be”. However, the 31-year-old England captain says he has “got into a place where I feel like I am back at 2019, 2020 in terms of my own body and fitness”. He has been helped by the fact that playing only two matches in India allowed him to concentrate on preparing himself for the summer. “What I have done is given myself the best opportunity to play a full role with the ball this summer,” he said. “I would much rather have been playing but I was actually able to turn a disappointing situation into a positive one because I was able to concentrate on properly being able to train. Sitting here today I’m actually thinking it could have been a blessing in disguise.” While he had a lengthy bat in the nets on Wednesday and has no concerns about his ability to build a Test innings, Stokes has not bowled all week and for all his pre-match positivity may attempt to avoid doing so once the action begins at Lord’s. “I’ve made a promise to myself and teammates, in particular the bowlers, that I will be doing everything I possibly can to be in a position to fulfil that role,” Stokes said. “The great thing that sport and being out in the arena gives you is adrenaline. It gives you stuff you’re able to do in a game that you probably would not be able to do [in] training.” But the decision not to select Jimmy Anderson, Ollie Robinson or Mark Wood for this game illustrates England’s approach to the Ireland Test at Lord’s. “It would be a completely different team if this was Australia tomorrow. I don’t think I’m wrong in saying that. We had to look at risk versus reward and I didn’t feel this game was worth taking the risk.” If England have taken no risks, however, neither have they relied on safe bets. Chris Woakes, particularly given his fabulous record at Lord’s, would have been one of those but England will instead to give a debut to Josh Tongue. “Everyone knows what Chris offers to a team, so we saw this as a chance to give Tongue an opportunity and see what his character’s like and how he can influence a game,” Stokes said. “It was a great opportunity we couldn’t look past.” Tongue’s ascent from sickbed to Test team has been meteoric – after 14 months out of the game with a shoulder complaint he came back last August, made his England Lions debut in January and will walk out at Lord’s, for the first time in any competition, in June – but Stokes revealed he has been monitored for some time. “He’s someone who has been spoken about ever since he first played for Worcestershire,” Stokes said. “He is someone who possesses a bit more pace than most of the guys who have been spoken about as the next guys in line. Someone who is able to bowl with that extra pace and come on and change the way the game is going and have that X-factor is always great to have in your side.” But even Tongue is more experienced than many members of the squad preparing to play only the seventh Test in Ireland’s history. It contains eight players who have played fewer than 20 first-class games and its youngest member, the 22‑year‑old Tom Mayes, made his first-class debut last week. “Whatever team we pick there’s not going to be a lot of first-class experience,” said Andrew Balbirnie, their captain. “There are players in our group who have the skill, there’s no doubt about that, but it’s a different skill in the longer format of the game. In [white-ball cricket] you just have to have a good 10-15 overs and you can come out on the right end of the result. A Test match is completely different and that’s going to be the biggest challenge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/07/tensions-brew-between-tehran-and-the-iaea-over-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T21:01:40Z","webTitle":"Tensions brew between Tehran and the IAEA over nuclear plant ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/tensions-brew-between-tehran-and-the-iaea-over-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/07/tensions-brew-between-tehran-and-the-iaea-over-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said he will need to go to Tehran very soon to restore his inspectorate’s ability to monitor Iran’s nuclear programme. Rafael Grossi also said that Iran should not have carried out recent unilateral changes at the Fordow nuclear plant, which will require increased inspections. The modifications, discovered by the IAEA and reported to the board of governors last month, involved an undeclared change to the interconnection between two machines enriching advanced uranium. Speaking at Chatham House in London, he said: “There has been a modification that should have been reported. You cannot go back and right this wrong. The thing is that, of course, with this modification, the facility has new capabilities so we have to inspect more.” His remarks suggest Grossi was not convinced by the Iranian explanation that the changes at the plant had been due to a human error and had been corrected. But he insisted he wanted a reset with Iran. He said recent denials of access for his inspectors by the Iranians meant “it will be very difficult to restore a complete picture of what we have in the Islamic Republic in terms of nuclear infrastructure”. Admitting he did not know if the 2015 nuclear deal with western powers could ever be revived, he said “[Iranian authorities] gradually started to shut down the visibility of the agency on a number of things, which are very, very important. That is the gap that worries me at this point in time. Because we are losing this visibility, and the [nuclear] programme continues to work – this is why I need to go to Tehran. We need to talk and we need to do it soon.” Grossi has previously visited Tehran in a bid to restore his inspection team’s ever-diminishing access to Iran’s nuclear sites, but often returned with only slight modifications. There is also an ongoing standoff between the IAEA and Iran over the regime’s inability to explain the presence of nuclear particles at three previously undeclared sites. Rossi rejected Iranian claims he was seeking to politicise the issue, arguing instead that he was “constantly opening doors and constantly looking for another solution”. Without this indispensable dialogue, things will get worse, he warned. “Our ability to do what we are supposed to do is so crucial, without that – without the IEA being able to tell the world that the nuclear programme in Iran is completely for peaceful use – then there will be this instability.” There is a tension within western capitals, with some politicians wanting to abandon the talks and take a hard line with a regime they feel is slowly losing grip on power, while others believe that the risk of losing any nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran would be too destabilising."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-18T06:40:08Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: court upholds acquittals of three Tepco executives over disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Three former executives from the company that operates the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have had their not-guilty verdicts upheld by a court in Japan, dealing a blow to campaigners demanding the firm take legal responsibility for the disaster in March 2011. The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death. The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986. The three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japan’s recorded history. More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. Wednesday’s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019. The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe. A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 – three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it. The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the government’s evaluation, saying the defendants “could not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in height”, Kyodo reported. Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepco’s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay ¥13.32tn (£80bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster. In contrast to Wednesday’s decision, the court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures. While that ruling – the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster – carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan. Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T22:30:08Z","webTitle":"PM to chair roundtable on boosting UK’s nuclear power output","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson will chair a meeting on how to increase the UK’s nuclear power output on Monday, as he prepares to publish his energy security strategy this month amid soaring prices. The prime minister will discuss domestic nuclear projects with leaders from the nuclear industry at a roundtable meeting at Downing Street, No 10 said. Johnson is expected to publish the government’s energy security strategy later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a cost of living crisis even before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy. The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. Nuclear power plants currently provide about a sixth of the UK’s electricity. Johnson has previously announced that he intends to remove fossil fuels from UK electricity generation by 2035, and has also argued that the country should invest in more domestic nuclear and renewable energy in order to become more self-sufficient. No 10 officials said topics expected to be discussed at the roundtable meeting include how government and industry can work together to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply. Downing Street added that nuclear power is a “safe, clean and reliable energy source”. Last November, the government agreed to invest in a new generation of mini-nuclear reactors, being developed by engineering firm Rolls-Royce. Ministers hope that these small modular reactors, or SMRs, will be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors – such as the Hinkley Point C project – which pose considerable construction risks and are often beset by spiralling costs and delays. Johnson told Conservative members at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool over the weekend that the government was going to place some “big bets on nuclear power”, including backing SMRs and larger projects. However, some environmental experts have raised concerns over how to safely dispose of nuclear waste after the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Labour has said it supports building more nuclear sites, and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called on Sunday for ministers to “get on with the investment in new nuclear”, as well as renewable energy. Johnson is also due to meet executives from the wind sector in the coming days as he looks to bolster domestic energy sources from all available quarters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/26/fears-that-uks-net-zero-strategy-will-be-blown-off-course-by-oil-and-gas-pressures","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T00:05:03Z","webTitle":"Fears that UK’s net zero strategy will be blown off course by oil and gas pressures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/26/fears-that-uks-net-zero-strategy-will-be-blown-off-course-by-oil-and-gas-pressures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/26/fears-that-uks-net-zero-strategy-will-be-blown-off-course-by-oil-and-gas-pressures","fields":{"bodyText":"It was supposed to be called “Green Day” – a big presentation of the national strategy for reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it has been rebranded, apparently. The event, taking place in Aberdeen on 30 March, will no longer share a name with the California pop-punk band; ministers are understood to have plumped for the less lyrical “energy security day”. But climate campaigners fear it looks set to be, to quote Green Day’s 2004 hit, a Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Energy secretary Grant Shapps and chancellor Jeremy Hunt have come under pressure from industry to produce a meaningful response to US president Joe Biden’s $369bn in climate subsidies, granted through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has seen major companies reallocate investment to the US. The pair will also be hoping to seize the initiative from Labour, which has made the switch to green energy a key battleground. Shapps and his newly formed Department for Energy and Net Zero certainly have a mandate to shake up a crucial industry. As the energy crisis has escalated over the past 18 months, it has exposed flaws across the sector – from tariffs and decarbonisation concerns to the link between wholesale gas and electricity prices. But the Guardian has revealed that the presentation will contain measures to please the fossil fuel industry, from new offshore drilling plans to a refusal to force oil and gas companies to stop flaring by 2025 – as recommended by Chris Skidmore in his net zero review. It may even give a licence to the huge, and so far undeveloped, Rosebank oil and gas field off Shetland. It is understood that Ofgem will not, as had been mooted, be given powers to include the net zero target in its regulation of the energy sector, and that the only measure aimed at improving Britain’s energy efficiency will be a consultation on improving insulation in the private rental sector. On the renewables side, there are concerns Britain’s prowess in offshore wind could be rapidly eroded if Biden’s IRA subsidy tempts investment away from the UK to the US. A windfall tax on some electricity generators has not helped investor confidence. Meanwhile, green campaigners hope Shapps will confirm a lifting of the effective ban on onshore wind developments, amid concerns it will persist. Industries expected to get particular attention in the presentation are nuclear, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Hunt made great fanfare of nuclear at this month’s budget, aiming to reclassify the technology as “sustainable” so as to attract environment-conscious investors, and kicking off a competition for small modular reactor (SMR) designs. However, it is unclear whether the reclassification will help in the hunt for co-investors alongside EDF and government in the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. And industry insiders say the SMR competition has merely delayed the decision on which projects to fund. The chancellor also announced £20bn of spending on carbon capture and storage projects over 20 years, with a promise to get “spades in the ground” from next year. The technology captures the CO2 emitted by big polluters and stores it underground. Backers of the projects hope Thursday will provide answers on which proposals will receive approval. Last week, power station owner Drax said it had paused investment in carbon capture until the government decides whether it will offer financial support. Hunt’s £20bn has been labelled a PR exercise and a “dangerous gamble” on unproven technology, as the £1bn-a-year spending primarily falls outside this parliament. Onlookers also hope to see firmer plans on supporting the green hydrogen industry – seen as important to decarbonising heavy industry – electric batteries and storage facilities, vehicles and the supply of critical minerals into that sector. Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband is not getting his hopes up. He criticised the Conservatives’ “low ambition and chronic underfunding of green projects”, and added that Labour plans to create a “publicly owned national champion in clean power generation, and deliver a million good green jobs”. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “This is the best opportunity for the government to stop us being left behind in the global race on green growth … [it] must put the budding UK industries of renewable energy, electric vehicles, batteries and green steel at the heart of the UK’s economic plan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-07T20:37:42Z","webTitle":"Money talks: how Saudi Arabia's soft power project is shaking up sport | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","fields":{"bodyText":"Looking back, so much of it was already there on that night in Diriyah when a storm raged across the desert and Anthony Joshua made history – and £60m – by retaining his world heavyweight title belts. Not just the good, the bad and the ugly of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions, but the accommodations of those willing to take the money and look the other way. One moment from the fight in December 2019 lingers more than most: Joshua absorbing the cheers from the young crowd, many of whom were women in western clothes, before averting his gaze upwards towards the kingdom’s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and giving a fist-pump to the man who had made it all possible. It felt disconcerting yet no one was really surprised. A couple of days earlier, Joshua had responded to questions about human rights by insisting the Saudis were “trying to do a good job politically” before adding: “I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.” Perhaps Joshua was unwilling to delve any deeper for fear that those dissenting whispers would permanently stain his conscience. He was the first global sports star to display a sunny-side-up approach to the kingdom rarely seen outside its own PR campaigns, but far from the last. Only this week Bryson DeChambeau claimed the Saudis were “trying to do good for the world and showcase themselves in a light that hasn’t been seen in a while” by setting up LIV Golf. Meanwhile, taking it all in was Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who sported the look of a man whose lottery numbers had just come in on the same day he had hit an 11-team accumulator. “This really feels like a really big moment where everything could change,” he told me. “If they’re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we’ve got to be realists.” It was a comment to make Henry Kissinger purr. But Hearn was merely ahead of the game. That Joshua fight put the world on notice about how serious Saudi Arabia was about sport. The acquisition of Newcastle United, and the hosting of Formula One and high-profile golf events confirmed it. On Tuesday the Saudi regime flexed their muscles further by striking a deal with the PGA Tour to merge with LIV, backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the same time they are also throwing impossible sums to attract western players to the Saudi Pro football league. The question now is what happens next. Saudi Arabia has not officially bid for the 2030 World Cup, but that is only a matter of time. Cricket is also said to be of interest, especially with so many of the population from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Esports is another major focus – next month it will host Gamers8, which is billed as the world’s largest gaming and esports festival. But wherever the Saudis go next, they have reminded us of two age-old truisms: money wins – and most people have a price where they will do business. As Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions grow, people continue to wonder what lies behind it all. We live in a world that prefers certainty over nuance, simple answers not complex truths. But the following is all true: it is about sportswashing, using sport as a tool of soft power, and improving the lives of its population, 70% of which is under 35, and diversifying its economy, all at the same time. According to the Saudis, the value of their sports event industry is growing by 8% per year, rising from $2.1bn in 2018 to an estimated $3.3bn by next year. It wants to have more people coming to Saudi Arabia, playing golf and spending their pounds, dollars and euros in the country. People also tell me that the rate of change since I was there is dazzling. I can believe it. Yet it will not be able to wash away its human rights record that easily. Not when in the last 15 months, it has jailed a woman, Salma al-Shehab, for 34 years for merely following and retweeting dissidents and activists. And also executed 81 people in one day. According to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, 41 of those killed were Muslims from the Shia minority “who had taken part in anti-government protests in 2011-12, calling for greater political participation”. That should sicken us all. Yet for too many people sporting success trumps human rights. As Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft, puts it when asked about Newcastle United’s supporters cheering on their owners: “A lot of sports fans are easily bought off. If somebody buys their team, they support them. Even if it happens to be an authoritarian government, like the Saudis.” In other words, sportswashing works. Of course there is hypocrisy here too. Sporting stars and supporters are hammered for taking the Saudi coin, while at the same time few question Britain when it exports billions of pounds in weapons to the country and receives billions of pounds in foreign investment in return. Meanwhile, the Saudis’ influence on sport is only going to grow, as Rory McIlroy painfully acknowledged on Wednesday. “The PIF and the Saudis want to spend money in the game of golf and they are not going to stop,” McIlroy said. “Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? At the end of the day money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.” As a statement of cold, hard realpolitik it was hard to argue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T22:33:33Z","webTitle":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","fields":{"bodyText":"Iran has pledged to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. Restoration of the cameras is among assurances reportedly given to the UN nuclear agency that Tehran will finally assist an investigation into uranium particles found at undeclared sites, it said. The breakthrough came as the watchdog’s director general, Rafael Grossi, who earlier met the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Tehran, returned to Vienna and said that some of the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored. A joint statement from the IAEA and Iran said: “Iran expressed its readiness to … provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues.” The statement did not go into detail on the extent of the assurances but the possibility of improved relations between the UN body and Iran is likely to ward off fresh calls from western countries for Iran to cooperate, diplomats said. Iran has made similar promises before that have yielded little or nothing. The country is supposed to provide access to information, locations and people, Grossi said after returning from Iran before a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors. Iran would also allow reinstallation of extra monitoring equipment that had been put in place under the 2015 nuclear deal, but was removed last year. The visit to Iran came shortly after the IAEA reported that uranium particles enriched up to 83.7% had been found at an underground nuclear site. Fears are growing that Iran has accelerated enrichment but Grossi said the Iranians had agreed to boost inspections at the facility by 50%. He also confirmed the agency’s findings that there has not been any “production or accumulation” of uranium at the higher enrichment level. Nonproliferation experts say Tehran has no civilian use for uranium enriched to even 60%. A stockpile of material enriched to 90%, the level needed for weapons, could quickly be used to produce an atomic bomb, if Iran chooses. The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers limited Tehran’s uranium stockpile and capped enrichment at 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. It also barred nuclear enrichment at Fordo, which was built deep inside a mountain to withstand attacks from the air. The US unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, which then began openly breaching the deal’s restrictions. The IAEA has accused Iran of stonewalling its investigation into traces of processed uranium found at three undeclared sites. Its board of governors censured Iran twice last year for failing to fully cooperate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-11T16:45:58Z","webTitle":"UK power prices hit record high amid cold snap and lack of wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","fields":{"bodyText":"UK power prices have hit record levels as an icy cold snap and a fall in supplies of electricity generated by wind power have combined to push up wholesale costs. The day-ahead price for power for delivery on Monday reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange. The price for power at 5-6pm, typically around the time of peak power demand each day, passed an all-time high of £2,586 a megawatt-hour. Prices are surging as the weather forces Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy, despite high bills. Snow and ice have caused disruption as the cold weather looks set to continue into this week, with snow forecast for parts of east and south-east England, as well as Scotland. The cold snap, which is expected to last for at least a week, comes as wind speeds reduced sharply, hitting power suppliers. Live data from the National Grid’s Electricity System Operator showed that wind power was providing just 3% of Great Britain’s electricity generation on Sunday. Gas-fired power stations provided 59%, while nuclear power and electricity imports both accounted for about 15%. The increase in power prices come amid jitters over energy supplies this winter. National Grid warned in October that a combination of factors such as a cold spell and a shortage of gas in Europe related to the war in Ukraine could lead to power cuts in the UK. The anticipated surge in power demand on Monday evening will coincide with a planned use of the National Grid’s demand flexibility service between 5pm and 7pm. The scheme pays businesses and households to cut their consumption at peak times to reduce the strain on the grid. The scheme has been used several times as part of a series of tests but is yet to be used as a result of electricity supply shortages. National Grid flirted with using it under these circumstances last month but did not do so. Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine at UK Health Security Agency, encouraged those with health conditions to heat their homes to a comfortable temperature. “In rooms you mostly use such as the living room or bedroom, try to heat them to at least 18C if you can. Keep your bedroom windows closed at night. Wearing several layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thicker layer,” he said. German day-ahead power prices rose 33% to €434 (£373) a megawatt-hour, the highest since 13 September, while the French contract rose 40% to €465 a megawatt-hour, Bloomberg reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/06/iaea-chief-qualifies-claim-that-iran-will-restore-nuclear-site-monitoring","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T16:49:25Z","webTitle":"IAEA chief qualifies claim that Iran will restore nuclear site monitoring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/iaea-chief-qualifies-claim-that-iran-will-restore-nuclear-site-monitoring","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/06/iaea-chief-qualifies-claim-that-iran-will-restore-nuclear-site-monitoring","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the UN nuclear weapons inspectorate was forced to qualify some of the claims he made about commitments he had extracted from Iran at the weekend about increasing access to UN inspectors. At his first press conference on his return from Tehran on Saturday, Rafael Grossi said “yes” when asked if Iran had pledged to restore all the cameras and other surveillance equipment that it had removed from its nuclear-related sites. But at Monday’s press conference he qualified this, saying it required further discussion. He said there was no agreement at this point on Iran handing over older footage and data taken by cameras and other equipment at the nuclear-related sites, or on future provision of that footage and data. “There are certain things we need to clarify,” he said. Grossi’s visit to Tehran came ahead of a meeting of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency this week to discuss a possible further censure of Iran for failure to cooperate with inspectors. If the IAEA board passes a highly critical resolution, Iran might again respond by increasing levels of uranium enrichment and stockpiles that are already far in excess of the limits set in the nuclear deal of 2015. It could also destroy some of the camera footage it has been storing at nuclear sites but not handing to the UN inspectors, a move that would further damage the IAEA’s continuity of knowledge about the nuclear programme. Grossi, a highly experienced Argentinian diplomat, has extracted Iranian promises before to restore the inspectors’ previous level of access that European powers and the US feel were not delivered, so in a context of minimal trust the west will want to examine how precise and bankable are the latest set of voluntary commitments that Iran offered Grossi in Tehran. A concern is that Tehran is making vague promises to carry it over the hurdle of the IAEA board meeting. On the other hand, the US, preoccupied with Ukraine, appears not to be in a mood to censure Iran over its nuclear programme or to try to restore the stalled nuclear deal. At his press conference, Grossi dismissed public statements by Iranian officials that they would not give him access to key Iranian nuclear scientists, implying that behind the scenes they are sending him different messages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T07:00:43Z","webTitle":"Brands embrace Eurovision - and the spending power of its 180m viewers ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","fields":{"bodyText":"The wind machines have been tested, dance routines perfected and wardrobe malfunctions eliminated. At this stage, there is not much you can do about the singing or the song choice. So as one pageant in Britain ends, another begins, with the Eurovision song contest semi-finals kicking off in Liverpool on Tuesday. Whether you consider it a cringeworthy affair or the World Cup of music, it is one of the most-watched shows on the planet, with 180 million people expected to tune in. Viewers may watch expecting to hear some cheesy songs but these days the sponsors are big cheeses, too – including the cream cheese maker Philadelphia – as the business world embraces Eurovision’s inclusive message and the spending might of that huge fanbase. When tickets for the final sold out in about half an hour, fans joked they would “live on Philadelphia” in an attempt to win the VIP tickets up for grabs on limited-edition packs. When you think about it, the marriage of Philadelphia and “Europe’s cheesiest song contest” is the stuff of Don Draper. This year, the Christmas favourite Baileys also wants to be on your radar if you are planning a “Eurosoiree”. The brand has inked a three-year deal with Eurovision and enlisted the 2014 winner, Conchita Wurst, as a brand ambassador. Paul Carton, Baileys’ global marketing director, said it wanted to be part of the “world’s most joyful global celebration of inclusive and diverse cultures and communities”. The deal means the Austrian drag queen can be found shaking Baileys cocktails on its social media channels. While these tie-ups appear as frivolous as last year’s Norwegian entry – Subwoolfer’s Give That Wolf a Banana – more well-known brands want to be part of the spectacle and have more opportunity to do so. While going out on the BBC means “nul points” for advertisers in the UK, the contest now airs on Eurovision’s own YouTube channel. It is also livestreamed on TikTok. With a week to go, #Eurovision2023 has already garnered more than 1bn video views on the app. Dr Paul Jordan, an expert on the contest who is known as Dr Eurovision, says sponsorship has been part of Eurovision for a long time, with its presence sometimes causing headaches for the BBC. “It used to be difficult to attract large, mainstream sponsors but now this doesn’t appear to be such a challenge,” said Jordan, who suggested this was down to a “renewed appreciation of the contest. It also embodies the values of a lot of people, particularly the younger generation. “Social media is a big part of the attractiveness for brands,” he added. “Songs have gone on to become viral hits thanks to TikTok. Armenia’s entry last year came 20th on the night, yet went on to become a huge hit online – probably the most successful ever in terms of streams and downloads.” The competition is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is an alliance of public services broadcasters. It is a co-production between the host broadcaster and other participating outlets who pay a fee to take part. Sponsorship revenue helps offset the costs of the event. This year’s partners include the beauty brand Moroccanoil, the travel site Booking.com, TikTok, Baileys, and Mondelēz, the US food group behind Philadelphia. The BBC’s national sponsors include easyJet and Google. An EBU spokesperson said the contest’s huge global reach and values of “inclusiveness, diversity and universality” made the event popular with brands. Liverpool is hoping that staging Eurovision will bring a £40m boost for the city. With songs interspersed with awkward travel clips, easyJet’s pitch that it offers “more seats between the UK and Eurovision countries than any other airline” also makes sense. Joe Cuffaro, the head of PR and marketing at the communications agency WSA, said: “Eurovision acts as a bit of tourism ad for the host country, as well as the other entrants. Then, for brands like Baileys, there is all the partying that goes on. I think the fact it does not take itself too seriously is part of the mass appeal.” Finally, don’t forget Invivo X Unity if you are settling down to watch. No, it is not the Italian entry, it’s the “official prosecco of the Eurovision song contest”. With a bottle design that aims to “inspire more unity around the world” this exclusive £12 fizz can only be found at Ocado and, yes, there is a rosé version, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-12T18:06:08Z","webTitle":"Biden dangles $6bn investment if Northern Ireland power sharing agreed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden has dangled a $6bn (£5bn) carrot in front of Northern Ireland’s leaders with a promise to boost the country’s economy with US investment if power sharing is restored. In a thinly veiled message to the Democratic Unionist party, which has been boycotting the devolved government for more than a year, the US president told an audience in Belfast that American investors were ready to “triple” the $2bn already invested. “The simple truth is that peace and economic opportunity go together,” Biden said. He reminded representatives of the region’s five biggest parties, who sat at the front of the auditorium, of how transformative the Good Friday agreement had been 25 years ago and urged them to put the past behind them and look at the prosperity that could flow in the next quarter of a century. In the past 25 years, the gross domestic product of Northern Ireland had doubled, while in “just the past decade” almost $2bn in US investment had gone into the economy, he said. “I predict to you if things continue to move in the right direction, [it] will more than triple,” he said. “There are scores of major American corporations wanting to come here, wanting to invest. “It is up to us to keep this going, keep going in the work that has been done every day for the last 25 years.” The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed Biden’s visit but said it “doesn’t change the political dynamic in Northern Ireland”. He said: “I had a brief conversation with the president, and he made clear that it’s not his job, as we heard in his speech, to take decisions for political leaders in Northern Ireland. “But the United States stands ready to support Northern Ireland in whatever way it can. So I welcome his visit here today – it’s good to see the president coming and we hope to see investment into Northern Ireland flowing from his efforts and those of his special envoy.” Speaking at Ulster University in Belfast, Biden – citing the cyber and tech industries, green energy and young entrepreneurs – said the opportunities for Northern Ireland to lift itself into becoming a major part of the UK economy were “incredible”. He urged political leaders to “sustain the peace”, promising it would “unleash this incredible economic opportunity”. Biden’s special economic envoy for Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, would be heading a trade delegation to the region “maybe later this year” to “supercharge” a new wave of investment, Biden promised. He urged the DUP to return to power-sharing arrangements at Stormont and said an “effective devolved government … is going to draw even greater opportunity in this region”. Kennedy later told reporters that US corporations always sought stability as a prerequisite for investment. Biden said: “I hope the assembly and the executive will soon be restored.” Cautious not to be seen as interfering, he quickly added: “That is a judgment for you to make, not me, but I hope it happens.” He told the audience that he was part-English by birth but he swerved commentary over any alleged pro-nationalist bias. Donaldson was seen beaming while having convivial chats with Kennedy and later on an informal walkabout with Biden. He said restoration of power sharing would only happen if the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, took steps to remove the remaining Brexit barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Sunak missed Biden’s speech in order to visit a senior PSNI officer who was shot in Northern Ireland earlier this year. Sunak is understood to have met DCI John Caldwell and his family at a hospital in the north-west. The PSNI described it as a “private visit” and would not comment. Earlier, one of Biden’s senior aides was forced to deny that the president was “anti-British” after accusations by the former DUP leader Arlene Foster that the US president “hates the UK”. The party’s chief whip, Sammy Wilson, when asked about Biden’s visit, said his party would “not be bought”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, the MP for East Antrim said: “On one hand, he [Biden] says he’s here to help the peace process and the Good Friday agreement; on the other hand he has done his best to undermine the Good Friday agreement and its institutions, and indeed his backing of the EU against the UK government, trying to force [the] UK government into a corner to accept EU interference in Northern Ireland, has not helped the process and has led to the collapse of the institutions.” The atmosphere at Ulster University was reverent and jovial, with the president working the room and posing for selfies and handshakes with party leaders after his speech. Doug Beattie, the head of the Ulster Unionist party, and Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, said Biden had spoken to them about the economic opportunities in their private conversations, underlining the message from the US. Time was also set aside for the Northern Irish actor James Martin, who became the first person with Down’s syndrome to have the leading role in an Oscar-winning movie, after starring in the short film An Irish Goodbye."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-24T11:32:08Z","webTitle":"Acosta Danza: Spectrum review – passion and power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","fields":{"bodyText":"The title of this mixed bill is spot on when it comes to describing the full range of Acosta Danza. Carlos Acosta’s Havana-based company was always intended to be many things: a proudly Cuban outfit that could hold its own on the European touring circuit; a group of dancers comfortable in every style from ballet to hip-hop to Cuban dance styles; and a choice of international choreographers who aren’t just the same old names. In all that, Acosta Danza succeeds, and it’s always a pleasure to watch these dancers, even if the rep tonight doesn’t set the stage on fire. They have a clear passion for performance, great energy and presence; all very different bodies, but increasingly familiar faces. Raúl Reinoso and Mario Sergio Elías, who have been with the company since it began in 2016 , both have strong solo moments, and the striking Zeleidy Crespo arrives in Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Faun like the tall stem of an elegant bloom, strongly rooted even when the choreography buffets her body in every direction. Faun is an impishly magical duet made in 2009 (inspired by Nijinsky’s L’Après-midi d’un Faune) and it has proved to have a long life, taking on new inflections with each set of dancers. Its strength choreographically is in taking just one idea and one movement lexicon and fully exploring it, and that focus pays off where other works might be more roving and ultimately less satisfying. Not that there isn’t plenty to enjoy and engage with elsewhere. Up and coming American choreographer Micaela Taylor gets every muscle in her dancers’ bodies moving in Performance, hitting each quaver beat with inventive ideas. Spanish choreographer Juanjo Arqués tries to give us a picture of Cuba beyond the cliche in Portal, showing a community bound in percussive grooves but also solo dancers in handheld spotlight, under slightly sinister scrutiny. And there are slick jazz-inspired moves, set to spoken word (a translation would have been helpful), in Goyo Montero’s Alrededor No Hay Nada, which has an element of vaudeville and considers power dynamics. Something for everyone.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls. There were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopol’s air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning. The basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day. The Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover. The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols. Earlier in the week, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”, saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity. Petro Kotin, Energoatom’s president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces. “They have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,” Kotin told the Guardian. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. “You can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there aren’t any Ukrainian forces that close,” Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile. “My personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: “You see – we’re protecting you and it’s the Ukrainians who are shelling you.” It was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlov’s accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant. The IAEA inspectors on site could theoretically determine the trajectory of incoming rockets or shells but such detective work is not within their mandate. The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to. Meanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow. “In some cases, there’s only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,” Orlov said. “People don’t have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.” Operating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscow’s control. “They take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,” Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts. In recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further. Melynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar. But keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown. If the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours. “Those remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,” Melynchuk said. “Even without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T14:00:53Z","webTitle":"Greens attack Albanese government’s ‘deeply unsettling’ secrecy on submarine nuclear waste plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor and the Coalition have been accused of taking a “deeply unsettling approach” to transparency around Aukus after the major parties blocked the publication of documents about nuclear safety and waste issues. The government cited national security concerns when it rejected a Senate order to produce documents, including those about options to manage operational waste from the nuclear-powered submarine program. The move comes just months after the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council warned against allowing a cloak of national security to “mask inadequate radiation safety protection of the Australian public, weaken regulatory authority, or inhibit transparency on matters of Australian public safety”. David Shoebridge, a Greens senator and defence spokesperson, said the council was “the very agency entrusted to protect Australians from radiation and ensure nuclear safety and security, yet the government is already ignoring its advice”. “The hiding of information at this early stage signals a deeply unsettling approach to future regulation, transparency and oversight of these nuclear submarines,” Shoebridge said. His motion had sought a range of documents reviewed by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) working group, including the safeguards required for a nuclear-powered submarine program. It also sought information about the “characterisation, classification and acceptance of risks in a nuclear environment” and any minutes of meetings held with the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce on these topics. But Anthony Chisholm, a Labor frontbencher said disclosing such material would be “contrary to Australia’s national interests”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It may be prejudicial to the security or defence of the commonwealth, and could prejudice international relations as well,” he said. The Coalition joined with Labor to defeat the motion in the Senate this week. The former independent senator and submariner Rex Patrick said the blocking of the motion “shows the shallowness of thinking behind both major parties as to the need for complete transparency around this important issue”. “This Aukus program has been orchestrated in total secrecy such that the government and Defence could get to a point of announcing a fait accompli without any debate or resistance,” Patrick said. “There are some things that should properly be kept secret around a submarine – but these things should not include nuclear stewardship, nuclear regulation, nuclear safety or how to deal with operational waste and spent fuel.” Patrick has, however, used freedom of information laws to obtain some other documents from Ansto and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa). These include minutes of an Ansto board meeting on 9 February showing the agency will seek government funding of $34.5m over the next four years because it faces increased workload “as a direct result of a nuclear-powered submarine program”. Ansto is also concerned about the risk of a “loss of workforce” to other taskforces and regulators as the Aukus project ramps up. It expects “increased frequency of requests for radiological monitoring” coinciding with an increase in visits to Australia by US and UK nuclear-powered submarines. A nuclear emergency response exercise was held in Hobart on Thursday. Guardian Australia understands this was the latest in a long series of “tabletop” exercises that aim to ensure government agencies can support nuclear-powered warship visits. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said Australia must become “responsible nuclear stewards”. “This will mean developing the full suite of skills, facilities and institutions along with an appropriate regulatory and legislative architecture to be nuclear stewards,” he said. The government has promised to establish “a new dedicated executive agency responsible for delivering the optimal pathway for Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine program”, while also setting up a new independent regulator. Within 12 months the government would “set out the process” to identify current or future defence land that could be used for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, Marles said. “I want to assure the parliament that there will be appropriate public consultation, particularly with First Nations communities to respect and protect cultural heritage,” he said. In the latest sign of misgivings within Labor, a party branch in the electorate of the prime minster, Anthony Albanese, passed a motion calling on his government to “withdraw from the Aukus alliance and cease any program in pursuit of the acquisition of nuclear submarines”. Party members at the Enmore branch meeting this week agreed that Labor should prioritise spending that contributes to the “social good of our society rather than wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on a dangerous and unnecessary weapons program”. According to a copy that has been widely circulated within NSW Labor, including to a large number of branch secretaries, the motion argued Aukus was “not in the interests of the Australian people” and “could take us into an unnecessary and devastating war”. The motion reflects concerns within elements of the party’s rank-and-file membership, but does not yet indicate a groundswell that could stop the deal. The federal Labor caucus is largely united behind the Aukus agreement unveiled last week by the prime minister, even though some MPs have asked questions. The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, vowed to allay concerns about the multi-decade plans. “This is the most significant industrial endeavour this country has ever attempted,” Conroy said. “That is why we need to give people confidence we have a plan and have thought through how to deliver it.” The Petersham branch – also within Albanese’s electorate – passed an anti-Aukus motion in late February, before the San Diego announcement. Labor members are also mobilising against the possibility of Port Kembla being selected as a future base for nuclear-powered submarines. Some members are understood to have been emboldened to register their concerns, after several prominent Labor figures including the former prime minister Paul Keating spoke out against Aukus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-01T00:02:37Z","webTitle":"Royal Navy orders investigation into nuclear submarine ‘repaired with glue’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","fields":{"bodyText":"The Royal Navy has ordered an urgent investigation amid claims that workers on a Trident nuclear armed submarine fixed broken bolts in the vessel’s reactor chamber using glue. The faulty repairs on the cooling pipes aboard HMS Vanguard were found after one of the bolts fell off during an inspection, the Sun reported. The bolt heads originally came off due to over-tightening. But, rather than replacing the damaged shafts, staff at the defence contractor Babcock implemented a quick fix and glued them back on. Engineers at the contractor reported it as a procedural glitch after the problem was found, but did not mention the botched nature of the repair. A navy source told the newspaper: “It’s a disgrace. You can’t cut corners with nuclear. Standards are standards. Nuclear standards are never compromised.” The glued bolts held insulation in place on the coolant pipes in the nuclear reactor and were found just as workers were set to fire it up to full power for the first time, the newspaper reported. Investigators will trawl records of repairs to find out when the bodged work occurred and who was ultimately responsible. The Ministry of Defence spokesperson said that a “defect” was found on HMS Vanguard when in dry dock and that it was “promptly reported and fixed”. The spokesperson said the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, met the chief executive of Babcock, David Lockwood, “to seek assurances about future work”. Babcock is the MoD’s second-largest contractor and has multibillion pound contracts to maintain the navy’s Astute and Vanguard sub fleets. A spokesperson for the company said: “Any quality-related issue is a huge disappointment, but our own robust inspection processes discovered the issue. There was no safety or operational impact from the work.” The Guardian reported in December last year of safety fears as the submarines had been deployed at sea for record-breaking periods of five months each. Rob Forsyth, who helped command Polaris nuclear submarines in the 1970s, said the lengthy patrol times could lead to “boredom, complacency and an inevitable drop-off in standards”. HMS Vanguard is one of four nuclear submarines that form part of the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent. The vessels are always out on patrol and are poised to strike in the unlikely event that Britain is hit with a nuclear attack. An MoD spokesperson said: “As part of a planned inspection, a defect was found from work done in the past when HMS Vanguard was in dry dock. It was promptly reported and fixed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-12T15:58:20Z","webTitle":"Women’s World Cup 2023 power rankings: breaking the finalists down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","fields":{"bodyText":"1) England The European champions’ momentum suffered a blow when defeat to Australia ended their 30-game unbeaten run. In contrast, they also added the Finalissima to their ever-expanding trophy cabinet this window. The Lionesses are still favourites with time to fix any problems. 2) USA It feels wrong to knock the back-to-back world champions off the top spot. They are still a force but defeats to Spain, England and Germany at the tail end of 2022 showed there is work to do. That may already be in progress as they are unbeaten this year. 3) Germany Defeat against Brazil will have surprised many, but Germany undoubtedly remain on track. Victory over the Netherlands showed their ability. The injury Alexandra Popp picked up in Nuremberg is a worry. 4) France New-look France, with controversial manager Corinne Diacre gone and Hervé Renard in, seem happier. A resilient recovery against Colombia in Renard’s first game was followed by a 2-1 defeat of the Olympic champions, Canada. 5) Australia Australia finished their overseas tour with optimism. Despite losing to Scotland, they then beat the European champions England. Their reliance on Sam Kerr staying fit could be a concern. But with their captain, the Matildas possess plenty of potential. 6) Spain Despite missing 15 key players after a falling out with the federation over conditions, Spain just keep winning. Wins against Norway and China came in this window. They could be formidable if the impasse with the players is resolved in time. 7) Canada How Canada will look this summer remains unanswered. A pay dispute and injuries have taken their toll. That they lost narrowly to France shows the character of the Olympic champions can not be discounted. 8) Brazil Brazil are without Marta, Debinha and Ludmila, but only narrowly lost to England on penalties in the Finalissima and earned a shock 2-1 defeat of Germany. A team growing in confidence with each positive result. 9) Sweden Peter Gerhardsson’s side are clearly not the team they once were. A loss to Denmark and a dramatic six-goal draw with Norway will be seen as a setback in their preparations. 10) Denmark Back-to-back wins against top-10 nations Sweden and Japan without influential forward Pernille Harder is no mean feat and a turnaround from defeats to Australia and the Netherlands to finish 2022. 11) Japan Defeat to Denmark will have not been on the cards for the 2011 World Cup champions. That loss followed a 2-1 victory over Portugal. Struggling for consistency against the top sides. 12) Netherlands The Dutch are still trying to find the answers to life without Vivianne Miedema. A comfortable win over Poland will have built confidence, but defeat to Germany showed they might struggle against the best. 13) Norway Came from behind twice against Sweden to earn a 3-3 draw after a 4-2 defeat to Spain in this window. Influential striker Ada Hegerberg leaving the pitch looking uncomfortable so soon after her return from injury will be a concern. 14) China Defeat to Spain illustrated how much China need to improve, but they are capable of shutting out an attack. England will need to be wary when they meet in Group D. 15) Italy Have lost their way a little since an impressive showing at their first World Cup in 10 years in 2019. A 2-1 defeat of Colombia was the team’s only fixture in this window. 16) South Korea Colin Bell’s side put 10 past Zambia in two matches in this window. They possess quality in attack, but struggled against stronger opposition at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. 17) Portugal A 2-1 defeat to Japan and draw with Wales rounds off the World Cup debutants international break. Before that they were unbeaten in eight months, with wins over Iceland, Haiti, Costa Rica, New Zealand and Cameroon. 18) Republic of Ireland Ireland’s unbeaten run ended with two narrow defeats to the USA. The performances more than the results, however, showed that Vera Pauw’s side are not to be dismissed. 19) Argentina After a heavy loss to Spain at the end of 2022, Argentina have beaten World Cup co-host New Zealand twice and earned a draw and win over Venezuela in this window. 20) Switzerland Switzerland have struggled to get their World Cup campaign going. They have slumped to three draws and a defeat this year, with a 0-0 draw with China and 2-1 loss to Iceland coming in this international break. 21) Colombia Colombia lost to rance and Italy but the displays showed they can compete. Their form is strong and they were only beaten narrowly by Brazil in last year’s Copa América final. 22) Nigeria Nigeria rounded off a successful international window with a comfortable victory over New Zealand. They had previously beaten Haiti 2-1. After a disappointing Africa Cup of Nations, their progress is clear. 23) New Zealand The co-hosts are on a dire run of form. New Zealand have not won in nine games, with losses to the USA, Portugal, Argentina and, most recently, Nigeria. 24) Jamaica Conceded nine and scored twice in defeats to Spain, Czech Republic and Australia at the friendly Cup of Nations in February. The team has one win in seven games. 25) South Africa Banyana Banyana have struggled since winning a first Africa Cup of Nations title in 2022. A 3-2 defeat to Serbia concluded this window. 26) Costa Rica Costa Rica endured a tough window with a heavy defeat to Scotland and narrow loss to Poland. Two wins against the Philippines last year showed they can compete with those around them. 27) Philippines Yet to be tested against top-level opposition. They cruised to wins over Pakistan and Tajikistan in their quest for Olympic qualification. Suffered narrow defeats to Scotland and Wales in February. 28) Vietnam One of the emerging nations in Asian football. Their focus, however, has been elsewhere this window with Olympic 2024 qualifying. They beat Nepal twice to progress before their World Cup debut. 29) Morocco Another World Cup debutant, Morocco suffered back-to-back defeats to Czech Republic and Romania in this window. That was added to a draw and defeat to the Republic of Ireland in November. 30) Haiti Yet another debutant, Haiti qualified through the intercontinental playoff this year. A narrow defeat to Nigeria showed promise. They possess one of the most exciting young players in Melchie Dumornay, who will join Lyon this summer. 31) Zambia Zambia enjoyed a standout 2022, defying the odds to finish third at the Africa Cup of Nations and win the Cosafa Championship. They suffered two heavy defeats to South Korea in this window and are, as yet, untested against top opposition. 32) Panama Panama beat the Dominican Republic twice in this break. They are entering their first World Cup after qualifying through the intercontinental playoffs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T09:03:43Z","webTitle":"Polls open in Turkish election runoff as Erdoğan hopes to retain power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. In the first round this month, Erdoğan upended expectations and many pollsters’ predictions by coming out ahead with 49.5% of the vote, as his rival took second place with 44.5%. A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdoğan’s coalition won a comfortable majority. A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. “Are we running to the polls tomorrow? Will we cast our votes from the early hours of the morning?” he asked a cheering crowd. Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. After initially focusing on how his candidacy offered voters a chance to reverse the changes introduced by Erdoğan, including promises of a return to parliamentary democracy and messages of social inclusion, Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign pivoted firmly to the right in advance of the runoff. Both candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round. Oğan declared his support for Erdoğan, while the head of the Victory party, Ümit Özdağ, backed Kılıçdaroğlu, claiming he believed the opposition leader was more likely to follow through on his pledge to deport millions of refugees and crack down on immigration. Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. When polled, those who voted for Oğan in the first round said they were more likely to back Erdoğan. “This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. We have never done this before, so we don’t know if the majority of voters will be more interested given that there are now two candidates. This is why it’s not easy to say what we’ll be witnessing. There may be surprises; Kılıçdaroğlu may win, but I agree his chances are not high compared to Erdoğan,” said Evren Balta, a political scientist at Özyeğin University. Many opposition supporters said they were determined to vote despite their candidate heading into the runoff in second place, searching for millions of votes in addition to the support he gained in the first round but with few obvious constituencies in which to find them. When asked what was driving him to vote despite the opposition’s path to victory appearing uncertain, 24-year-old Emre Göral replied with one word and a cautious smile: “Hope.” Erdoğan has focused on assuring voters by raising the minimum wage, providing free natural gas for the month of May and promoting growth in the country’s defence industry under his rule. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival. “Kılıçdaroğlu can’t handle a crisis,” said 34-year-old Shukran Tutem as she arranged T-shirts on a market stall. “If we compare Kılıçdaroğlu and Erdoğan, it’s easy to see that Kılıçdaroğlu wouldn’t bring anything good for this country’s future, but Erdoğan could.” During campaigning, misinformation was frequently deployed by both sides, including Erdoğan’s use of a deepfake video showing banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for Kılıçdaroğlu. After a first round in which the opposition initially claimed victory before accepting Erdoğan was in the lead, many opposition supporters have remained mistrustful of the result, despite the Republican People’s party stating that although it challenged counts in about 2,269 ballot boxes, this would not have changed the overall outcome. Balta said: “I think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high. These two sides are so polarised that whatever their leader, group or supporters say, they have a tendency to believe it.” In an interview with CNN after the first round, Erdoğan said he was confident of victory: “The people will be the kingmaker, and when the people decide, I believe they will stand with those who successfully served the Turkish nation for the past 21 years. In the end, my people will choose stability and competence and they will cast their votes accordingly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T20:54:20Z","webTitle":"Crises on multiple fronts threaten Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","fields":{"bodyText":"On Friday afternoon, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, found himself standing at the side of a remote road in the vast desert valley that runs the length of the occupied West Bank’s frontier with Jordan. Along with his defence minister, Yoav Galant, Netanyahu was inspecting the scene of a shooting attack earlier in the day that killed British-Israeli sisters Maia and Rina Dee, 20 and 15, and left their 45-year-old mother Lucy fighting for her life. An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) search for the perpetrator is still under way. “For this challenge as well, we are standing united, unified, sure of our righteousness,” Netanyahu said in comments broadcast by Israeli television. “We will act together with total backing for our forces.” Unfortunately for the prime minister, his remarks rang hollow for many Israelis. This week Israel has faced flare-ups in violence on almost every front – East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria. The security establishment has also been unnerved by the sudden rapprochement between Saudi Arabia – the region’s geopolitical heavyweight, with whom Israel is seeking warmer ties – and the country’s arch enemy, Iran. As if the intersecting border crises were not enough to deal with, Israel is also undergoing unprecedented upheaval at home sparked by the government’s bitterly contested plan to overhaul the judiciary. Dozens of former senior defence, security and intelligence officials have opposed the proposals weakening the supreme court on the grounds they are anti-democratic. Israel’s crucial military reservists, including almost all of those serving in its most important air force unit, have joined the nationwide protests and said they will refuse to attend for service, setting alarm bells ringing over the reliability of the chain of command and operational capacity. Galant might have been standing by his side as the pair pledged to find the Dee sisters’ killer, but two weeks ago, Netanyahu fired him after he became the first senior government official to voice objections to the judicial changes. Public pressure quickly forced the prime minister to back down, and announce that legislation weakening the supreme court would be postponed until after the Knesset’s Passover recess. But the lingering uncertainty over Galant’s position and the appointment of the inflammatory national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, does not exactly convey strength and stability – particularly now. Leaked Pentagon documents that surfaced on Saturday suggesting the Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, encouraged its staff and the Israeli public to participate in the protest movement, have added to a growing perception among Israel’s many foes that such internal discord represents an opportunity. “I served in the army for decades, and I did not see behaviour as reckless as that of Netanyahu now,” Moshe Ya’alon, a former defence minister and IDF chief of staff, said in an address at a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. “His obsessive plot to overturn Israel’s democracy represents an immediate threat to Israel’s security … Our enemies are watching, and our deterrence is waning.” Despite corruption scandals and a colourful private life, during his previous five stints as prime minister Netanyahu was generally seen as a safe pair of hands when it came to Israel’s security. Now, even among the rightwing public that voted in the current coalition of extremist and ultra-religious parties, dwindling support suggests that image is fading, and the Israeli leader could once again be forced out of office. A total of 69% of voters gave the government a bad grade on its first 100 days in office, according to polling released by Israel’s Channel 12 on Sunday. Hebrew media reported over the weekend that government sources had suggested they would be forced to launch a major military operation in the coming weeks, after the conclusion of the sensitive overlapping Passover and Ramadan holiday period, in order to bolster the coalition’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. Israel’s current government was elected on a platform promising order and security. So far, they have delivered the exact opposite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Lynmouth Road appears unremarkable. It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine,” says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.” The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, Esmé, 12, and George, 10, and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community,” says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that,” says Hilary. There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,” she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. “Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, you’d be over the moon, wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. “If it comes off, I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.” Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary, so I wasn’t that surprised,” he says, “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.” “We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,” says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.” The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising £40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20,000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off,” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project,” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.” “We’re not setting ourselves up as experts,” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof,” says Dan. While the whole street can’t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but I’m not great with heights,” he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking,” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years,” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.” The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. “It used to be full of very long-term residents,” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.” Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension,” he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want, the community spirit,” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.” The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment,” says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically, but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.” “I want to be part of the solution, even if it’s just a small part,” says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy, food, mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.” “It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic,” says Pippa Evans. “To me, it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community, we can make bigger changes than as individual people.” “The energy for what we do is drawn from anger, but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work,” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here, doing all this, if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world, but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.” “I can be really angry,” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think, ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick, it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time, we can’t be paralysed,” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action, and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.” The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet, but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools, including the one their son attends, to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in. “We’re busy behind the scenes, working out how it could become a street-by-street model,” says Hilary. “I hope, after the first wave, when there are people sharing testimonials, others will want to be involved, too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road, with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes. “I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up,” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households, and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate, otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.” The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan, the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening,” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels, the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down, you feel reliant on the government to change things,” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves, we can do things ourselves.” “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Dan.

Researchers at the US National Ignition Facility in California said fusion experiments had released more energy than was pumped in by the lab’s enormous, high-powered lasers, a landmark achievement known as ignition or energy gain. The technology is far from ready to turn into viable power plants – and is not about to solve the climate crisis – but scientists hailed the breakthrough as evidence that the power of the stars can be harnessed on Earth. Dr Arati Prabhakar, the policy director at the White House Office of Science and Technology, said: “Last week … they shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers going in. This is such a tremendous example of what perseverance really can achieve.” Fusion energy raises the prospect of plentiful clean power: the reactions release no greenhouse gases nor radioactive waste by-products. A single kilogram of fusion fuel, which is made up of heavy forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium, provides as much energy as 10m kilograms of fossil fuel. But it has taken 70 years to reach this point. Speaking at the announcement on Tuesday, Jill Hruby, of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), said the US had “taken the first tentative step towards a clean energy source that could revolutionise the world”. The National Ignition Facility is a vast complex at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San Jose. It was built to perform experiments that recreate, briefly and in miniature, the processes unleashed inside nuclear bombs, enabling the US to maintain its nuclear warheads without the need for nuclear tests. But the experiments are also stepping stones towards clean fusion power. To achieve the reactions, researchers fire up to 192 giant lasers into a centimetre-long gold cylinder called a hohlraum. The intense energy heats the container to more than 3m degrees celcius – hotter than the surface of the sun – and bathes a peppercorn-sized fuel pellet inside in X-rays. The X-rays strip the surface off the pellet and trigger a rocket-like implosion, driving temperatures and pressures to extremes only seen inside stars, giant planets and nuclear detonations. The implosion reaches speeds of 400km per second and causes the deuterium and tritium to fuse. Each fusing pair of hydrogen nuclei produces a lighter helium nucleus, and a burst of energy according to Einstein’s equation E=mc2. Deuterium is easily extracted from seawater, while tritium can be made from lithium which is found in the Earth’s crust. In the latest experiment, researchers pumped in 2.05 megajoules of laser energy and got about 3.15MJ out – a roughly 50% gain and a sign that fusion reactions in the pellet were driving further fusion reactions. “The energy production took less time than it takes light to travel one inch,” said Dr Marvin Adams, at the NNSA. Immense hurdles remain, however, in the quest for fusion power plants. While the pellet released more energy than the lasers put in, the calculation does not include the 300 or so megajoules needed to power up the lasers in the first place. The NIF lasers fire about once a day, but a power plant would need to heat targets 10 times per second. Then there is the cost of the targets. The ones used in the US experiment cost tens of thousands of dollars, but for a viable power plant, they would need to cost pence. Another issue is how to get the energy out as heat. Dr Kim Budil, the director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said with enough investment, a “few decades of research could put us in a position to build a power plant”. A power plant based on alternative technology used at the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire could be ready sooner, she added. “In some senses everything changes; in another, nothing changes,” said Justin Wark, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford and the director of the Oxford Centre for High Energy Density Science. “This result proves what most physicists always believed – fusion in the laboratory is possible. However, the obstacles to be overcome to make anything like a commercial reactor are huge, and must not be underestimated.” He said that asking how long it could take to overcome the challenges was like asking the Wright brothers how long it would take to build a plane to cross the Atlantic just after their maiden flight. “I understand that everyone wants to think of this as being the great solution to the energy crisis. It is not, and whoever says it is with any certainty is misleading. “It is highly unlikely that fusion will impact on a timescale sufficiently short to impact our current climate change crisis, so there must be no let up on our efforts in that regard. “The latest results also show that the basic science works – the laws of physics do not prevent us from achieving the goal – the problems are technical and economic. As Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning atomic physicist once said: ‘Prediction is very difficult, especially when it is about the future.’” Dr Mark Wenman, a reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, called the achievement a “fantastic scientific breakthrough – something we have not achieved in 70 years of trying”. But he said: “Challenges remain of how you can get the energy out of the system, how you can sustain the energy for long enough to be useful, how you scale up that energy and whether the energy can be cheap enough to compete with other sources.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:07:46Z","webTitle":"How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","fields":{"bodyText":"The attack of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – has triggered international concern about the safety of the country’s facilities. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy – it has four main power plants, with 15 reactors, generating about half its electricity. On Friday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said artillery fire at the plant could have caused destruction equal to “six Chernobyls”. For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the attack appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. “If there’s going to be a major nuclear incident it’s because something deliberately is being done,” said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. “Surely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesn’t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant – and those at Ukraine’s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine – has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building – Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle – ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants – has been disregarded. “It’s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,” said Scott. “It is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.” Grossi, who says the situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraine’s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these – or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes – could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plant’s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T14:21:08Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","fields":{"bodyText":"In his letter (22 December), Tom Smith describes the problems of storing the radioactive waste that is being produced by the UK nuclear reactors, and says that we need more honesty about these issues. The latter is also true of other problems with “new nuclear build”. Take, for example, the proposed Sizewell C reactor on the east coast. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that extreme “sea level events” could occur “at least once per year at many locations by 2050”. Sizewell C will be built near the sea on marshland. One engineer has estimated that the land where the reactor would be built will turn into a promontory encircled by the sea. Clearly the reactor site could be flooded. Then there is the problem of obtaining uranium, which is currently the fuel for the nuclear reactors. The UK has to import uranium from across the world. It is mainly mined on the land of Indigenous people – in the US, in Canada, in Australia and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The miners and their families have suffered years of ill health and even death from proximity to uranium. At the same time, having to import uranium means that this is not an independent source of energy for the UK. The government and the opposition have completely ignored all warnings; they go doggedly on, supporting the construction of the new nuclear reactor at Sizewell and considering plans to build others. But nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements. Apart from anything else, it is vastly expensive. The money it swallows should be put into developing genuine sustainable energy: tidal, wind and solar.

British prime ministers change so rapidly these days that a similar approach would risk recasting during rehearsal. However, Atri Banerjee’s deliberately non-Spitting Image RSC production stresses the remarkable universality of the play’s dissection of leaders and the led, fulfilling Cassius’s prophecy that Caesar’s murder will be “acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown”. The wider political context now is the flimsiness of power. Of the core world leaders who attended the 2019 G7 meeting, only two remain in power and one, Japan’s Shinzo Abe, was assassinated after leaving office. As the psephological sage John Curtice has pointed out, almost no head of government who led a country through Covid is still in post. Such churn gives urgency to the scene in which the conspirators discuss wanting power and what they will do with it; Brutus, leaving Mark Anthony in play, pays later for his kindness/weakness. In this version, Brutus and Cassius are played by Thalissa Teixeira and Kelly Gough, the characters’ pronouns changed to “she” and “her”, although curiously Anthony’s eulogy for Brutus still predicts that people will say: “This was a man!” There’s an intriguing hint of an anti-feminist dystopia in which women – also including Ella Dacres’ Octavius Caesar – are forced, like some nuns, to take male names, and this may also be an attempt at complete gender-fluidity of language, but the switches sometimes jar between eye and ear. Movement director Jennifer Jackson introduces a prologue and interludes in which actors swirl and howl, reminiscent of Bill Viola’s video installations of choreographed mobs. This underlines the play’s reflections on crowds and power, and more is made than usual of the feast of Lupercal being as significant a date as the Ides of March, this play sometimes seeming to be previewing Macbeth’s supernatural framing. Startlingly, stabbed Caesar bleeds black blood, possibly hinting at the oil greed of capitalism, which stains his assassins for the rest of the play. The crackle of these additions is sometimes absent from the dialogue. Though Banerjee eschews the enclosing Perspex box so modish in classical productions, there can feel to be a cold screen between actors and audience, possibly because the staging must fit nine different theatres on a UK tour. As Mark Antony, William Robinson suggests a weak, wonkish figure who rises higher than rivals expect, underlining Shakespeare’s prescience in identifying all known political types, as do Teixeira and Gough’s respective embodiments of an intellectual but unworldly and impatiently passionate legislator: most systems have such a Brutus and Cassius. Nigel Barrett’s cockily populist Caesar rings various alarm bells around the world, and Matthew Bulgo makes Casca the sort of cultured, honey-voiced thug that all administrations seem to have. Annabel Baldwin strikingly extends the role of Soothsayer into scene-shifter and conscience of the populace. That Julius Caesar ends with an unlikely and uneasy coalition in charge will also prove, in many places, further evidence of the eternal political truths of the play.

Every individual needs a purpose, it becomes their fuel, and the same can be said for every team. That is not to say Saracens do not have one but what I love about this Sale side is how clear their purpose is – to put northern rugby back on the map. They are desperately important to the Premiership in that sense and I’m so pleased they’ve made it to Twickenham. Playing for something beyond yourself can be such a driving force. We saw it with Rassie Erasmus building the narrative around the South African people for the Springboks in 2019 and Sale will be aware that they are representing so many more people than there are in the squad, in the changing room and even in the stands. Leaning into that can be huge. These are two evenly matched sides but the gulf is in experience. I don’t see Sale’s youngsters like Arron Reed, Tom Roebuck, Joe Carpenter and Gus Warr being fazed by the Twickenham occasion, though. They’ve proved themselves to be excellent players on too consistent a basis for that. That said, there’s nothing that can prepare you for the occasion like playing in it previously and Saracens have someone who is preparing to start in his ninth Premiership final in Alex Goode. That is a remarkable statistic. For Saracens it’s yet another trip to Twickenham and it’s safe to say that the tools are that little bit sharper than last season, when they did so incredibly well to reach the final in their first season back in the Premiership. This year there should be no redemption narrative. Rather, it’s an opportunity to celebrate a remarkably consistent season with a trophy. They have been models of excellence throughout the season, unbeaten at home, comfortably top of the table but they will know that will count for nothing if they do not win the title. That should be what they are fighting for as opposed to any external noise or pressure. There are mouthwatering clashes all over the pitch but for me the battle of fly-halves and flankers top the bill. A fly-half’s ability to influence proceedings is dependent on the direction in which their forward pack is travelling but in George Ford and Owen Farrell we have two special No 10s. For all the debate about who should start for England I truly hope that for 80 minutes we can just appreciate both. They’ve grown up together throughout their rugby life so it’s no surprise that they have so many similarities. The way they see the game and analyse the game, they’re the closest thing to having a player-coach on the pitch that you’ll get and that’s such a calming influence to have. But there are differences. In attack, Ford has a better feel and instinct for the game but that’s something that Farrell has really developed. You look at his team and the extra gears they have found, there seems to be a greater freedom to Saracens in attack and a greater freedom to Owen in himself as well. We’re looking at two of England’s great fly-halves. They both played in Premiership finals as 19-year-olds and there are more things that connect them than split them apart. This is a day to celebrate both of them. While both teams have injuries in the back row, Ben Earl’s duel with Tom Curry will be explosive. Curry’s game in attack has really come on in the last couple of years. I remember when he first got selected by England at No 8. His best position is No 7 (even if he’s at 6 on Saturday) and I wondered how he’d manage but what I saw was him take on that responsibility and become a better ball player and a better ball carrier. Earl, we know how dynamic and powerful he could be; he could look very comfortable at centre. He’s the closest thing we have to Levani Botia, it’s not a perfect comparison but he wouldn’t look out of place in the backline. That’s a really key head-to-head because when you have two teams like this, and with the battle lines drawn at the gainline, whoever is able to win those physical exchanges and disrupt the attacking flow will ultimately win this match. Enter the main stage Ben Earl and Tom Curry. The closer we get to the game the more nervous I get and I’m not even playing. On Monday I said Saracens would win straight off the bat. The only reason I’m now hesitant is because I’ve got so much respect for Sale, they’re a quality side. Emotionally they’ll be in the right place but if there’s not much between the teams maybe the chasm in terms of experience in matches like this will prove pivotal in the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/14/thailand-election-day-arrives-with-hope-of-unseating-junta-generals-from-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T00:26:32Z","webTitle":"Thailand election day arrives with hope of unseating junta generals from power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/thailand-election-day-arrives-with-hope-of-unseating-junta-generals-from-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/14/thailand-election-day-arrives-with-hope-of-unseating-junta-generals-from-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Thais voted on Sunday in an election that could lead to the defeat of the military-backed leader who has ruled the country for almost a decade. However, a skewed election system means the shape of the new government is “very unpredictable”, say analysts, and it is not clear if pro-democracy candidates will succeed in unseating the generals. Since 2014, Thailand has been ruled by Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who first came to power in a coup and who was later elected prime minister. A staunch royalist and conservative, Prayuth has run a strongly nationalistic election campaign, warning that opposition parties’ promised reform will bring chaos. Polling, however, has suggested that many voters do want change. Pheu Thai, the party associated with the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is expected to win the most seats. At Pheu Thai’s final big rally on Friday, his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, one of the party’s three prime ministerial candidates, told crowds that Sunday would be a “historic day” where Thailand will move “from junta rule to democratic rule”. Move Forward, the most progressive opposition party, has also enjoyed late surges in polling after capturing strong support from young voters during its campaigns. Younger generations have been drawn to its pledge to demilitarise politics and break up monopolies. It is also the only party to promise to reform the lese majeste law, under which criticism of Thailand’s powerful monarchy can lead to 15 years in prison. Sunday’s election is the first to be held after youth-led mass protests in 2020 shocked the establishment by calling not only for the removal of Prayuth, but also for the influence and wealth of the monarchy to be curbed – criticising an institution previously considered untouchable. Campaigning has featured unprecedented discussion of the lese majeste law, a new fault line in Thai politics. “It’s the first time in history that every political party has to talk about their stance on this sensitive topic,” said Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Thammasat University in Bangkok. This year’s election is “not only a referendum on the military, but the whole establishment”, he said, citing the increased questioning of the royal family’s role in society. The vote, Prajak said, “will be a crucial step for Thailand to return to democracy”. But he added: “The path may not be smooth.” Parties will be competing for 500 seats in the House of Representatives on Sunday, but even if opposition parties do well, they may not be able to take power. A future prime minister will be voted on jointly by the elected lower house and the senate – the latter’s 250 members having been appointed by the military after the last coup. Parties such as Pheu Thai will almost certainly need to form alliances to overcome this hurdle. “The electoral results can be predicted easily, but the government formation is very unpredictable,” said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, who added that unlikely partnerships are still possible. Kasinee Sudatip, 52, a voter in Khlong Toei, Bangkok, said she was so excited for Sunday’s election, she could barely sleep the night before. She has always supported Pheu Thai and will vote for them again, she said, adding that she wanted democracy back. The economy was much better under Thaksin, she added. “Poor people gained a lot of benefits. They introduced the 30 baht for the health treatment and also for funds for education,” she said, referring to Thailand’s universal healthcare scheme. Surangkana Kornsawat, 27, who works in a beauty clinic, who also voted in Khlong Toei, Bangkok, said she was supporting More Forward. “I want to see a new future Thailand - for new people to come and work for the country,” she said, adding she was tired of the ruling military-backed party. “I’ve been feeling the impact of them for eight years and it’s really bad. It’s a lot – too much to say. The electricity bill is high, the economy is bad.” She wanted democratic change, she added, including reform of the lese majesty law. If Pheu Thai won, that would also be ok, she added: “I’m just anti-dictatorship”. Opposition candidates could face extra-parliamentary moves that would keep them from power. Last week, a complaint was filed against Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of Move Forward, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied any wrongdoing. Complaints have also been filed against Pheu Thai. Pheu Thai’s campaign this year has been boosted by Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn, who has helped revive nostalgia for her father. However, at a rally on Friday night her fellow candidate Srettha Thavisin, a property tycoon, declared that he wanted “to serve as Thailand’s 30th prime minister”, prompting speculation that he could be the party’s primary candidate for leader. Thaksin, who remains a polarising figure, lives in exile to avoid legal charges. However, he has repeatedly commented that he would like to return – a prospect that analysts say could bring about political instability. For two decades, Thai politics have been shaped by division between Pheu Thai’s Shinawatra family versus the conservative military establishment. The power struggle between the two sides has resulted in long-running street protests and two military coups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T16:56:20Z","webTitle":"Climate activists must target power structures, not the public | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","fields":{"bodyText":"I am an environmental social scientist and climate activist. As Jack Shenker describes in his article (The existential question for climate activists: have disruption tactics stopped working?, 6 March), Extinction Rebellion’s recent decision to stop disrupting the public caused quite a fuss. Some people applauded the move as they thought it would favourably shift public opinion, while others insisted public disruption needs to remain a primary tactic to garner wider attention. Unfortunately, both camps are missing the point – once you have enough dedicated activists, the public is largely irrelevant to achieving political change. It is not the opinion, or even attention, of the public that matters, it is whether or not you are disrupting structures of power. Historical social movements have shown this repeatedly. Despite what we may like to believe in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government. It may theoretically give governments a mandate to act, but real change must first overcome powerful opposition from the structures that support governments, such as business and the legal and financial systems. The role of activists is to change the cost-benefit equation for these structures until it is more beneficial for them to accept change than to carry on with the status quo. For climate activists, the real question is not about the efficacy of disruptive tactics, it needs to be about targets. And the answer is power, not the public. Dr Laura Thomas-Walters Llandaff, Cardiff • What can we do about the climate crisis? What form should our protest take? Do the actions of Extinction Rebellion risk alienating those who they look to for support? Indigo Rumbelow, a supporter of Just Stop Oil and co-founder of Insulate Britain, takes the view that the debate “is not between those who want to take ‘moderate’ or ‘radical’ action. It’s between those who are standing by doing nothing at all, and those who are doing something. That’s where the line is drawn.” But it should never be like this. A democracy should allow voters to choose how their country is governed. There should be a constitutional requirement for those of us seriously concerned about the climate crisis to have our views expressed in government. This obviously doesn’t happen. Our government consists only of Tory MPs representing a minority of voters. Yes, we have offshore wind generation, but otherwise their response is desperately inadequate. As a result, we have to resort to any kind of protest we feel might make a difference. If our civilisation truly wants a route to survival, we need a representative democracy with proportional voting. Tim Williamson Bath • Jack Shenker asks if disruption tactics have stopped working in climate protests. I would ask: did they ever work? Starting with the suffragists and suffragettes (or possibly earlier), most radical and progressive movements have had extreme wings, driven by a sense of frustration that their voice is not being listened to. I would love to see some academic work try to quantify the effect of publicity-seeking “stunts” against patient political foot-slogging. Having spent most of my life doing the latter, I feel politics does work. I was born into a world where homosexuality and abortion were illegal and mixed‑race marriage regarded as immoral.

The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years. It caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. The two countries, which during the cold war were constrained by a tangle of arms control agreements, still account together for about 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads. Washington has been keen to preserve the treaty but ties with Moscow are the worst in decades over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an element that could complicate attempts by Joe Biden’s administration to maintain and reach a follow-on agreement. “Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,” a state department spokesperson said in emailed comments. Moscow in August suspended cooperation with inspections under the treaty, blaming travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies after Russian forces invaded neighbor Ukraine in February last year, but said it was still committed to complying with the provisions of the treaty. The state department spokesperson added that Russia had a “clear path” for returning to compliance by allowing inspection activities, and that Washington remains ready to work with Russia to fully implement the treaty. “The New Start treaty remains in the national security interests of the United States,” the spokesperson said. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections under New Start were due to take place in November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them, accusing the United States of “toxicity and animosity”, and neither side has set a new date. On Monday, Russia told the United States that the treaty could expire in 2026 without a replacement because it said Washington was trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Moscow in Ukraine. Asked if Moscow could envisage there being no nuclear arms control treaty after 2026, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the RIA state new agency: “This is quite a possible scenario.” The United States has supplied more than $27bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft rocket systems, 8,500 Javelin anti-tank missile systems and 1m 155mm artillery rounds. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving cold war era fears of an apocalyptic war. Shortly after taking office, Biden extended New Start by five years until 2026, giving time to negotiate while preserving what the Democratic administration sees as an important existing treaty. The previous administration of Donald Trump had ripped up previous arms control agreements and had been hesitant to preserve New Start in its current form, saying that any nuclear treaty must also include China, whose arsenal is rapidly growing but still significantly below those of Russia and the United States."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-19T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Nuclear nightmare: reckless leaders push the world back to the brink | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"Leaders of unstable nuclear-armed states do dangerous and foolish things when under stress. They miscalculate, provoke, overreach. Given the febrile state of bilateral relations, last week’s aerial military clash between Russia and the US over the Black Sea inevitably intensified fears of nuclear escalation. The incident dramatised how dangerous Vladimir Putin, cornered by his existential Ukraine blunder, truly is – and the risks he is increasingly prepared to run. But he’s not the only one. As often the case over the past year, Putin relied on American restraint. US forces could easily have gone after the offending Su-27 fighter at its Crimea base. Each time Russia’s president darkly hints at going nuclear, that once unthinkable prospect becomes a little less outlandish – and western leaders must steel their nerves. Russia’s repeated bombing of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fits this pattern of minacious brinkmanship. Russia possesses about 1,600 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, out of a military stockpile of about 4,500. Like the US and other nuclear weapons states, it is modernising and adding new systems. At the same time, a vital safety net of arms control treaties dating from the Soviet era is shredding. Last month, Putin ditched New Start, which caps deployed strategic nuclear arsenals. It was Russia’s last such treaty with the US. In other words, at the very moment when the Kremlin is under unprecedented pressure and US-Russia relations are at their most tense since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the political channels, agreed mechanisms and binding limits that could help avoid a nuclear collision are less robust and dependable than ever before. While the risk of unintended nuclear confrontation is ever-present, Putin’s recklessness makes it infinitely worse. Israel is another nuclear-armed state under extreme stress, mostly due to its volatile rightwing prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu’s perceived attempt to avoid jail by destroying judicial independence, and with it Israel’s democracy, has caused uproar. Significantly, his “coup” is under fire from serving members of the military and former defence ministers as well as much of civil society. If this destabilising nationwide upheaval were taking place in Pakistan, for example, loud international expressions of concern about the security of its secretive nuclear arsenal would be heard. So the comparative silence over the safety and control of Israel’s 90 or so undeclared warheads is disturbing. Amid an extraordinary standoff between Netanyahu and US president Joe Biden, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, fears civil war. “The abyss is within touching distance,” he said last week. There is good reason to worry about what Netanyahu may do, Putin-like, to escape his self-made troubles. He has threatened to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities in the past. Israeli media suggest he may now be planning an attack. Netanyahu warned this month of a “horrible nuclear war” unless Tehran’s uranium enrichment programme was halted. Would he start a Middle East conflict to save his skin? Past experience suggests he might. If the US and its allies were not so distracted by Ukraine, they might pay more attention to Netanyahu’s antics. Much the same may be said of the developing crisis in nuclear-armed North Korea, where inherent weakness is compounded by looming famine. New doubts surround dictator Kim Jong-un’s health and a problematic succession. Stirring the pot, China and Russia back him against the west despite the danger he poses. Kim spent last week firing off nuclear-capable ballistic missiles like there’s no tomorrow – and there may not be if he carries on like this. Analysts anticipate another underground atomic test. Kim regularly threatens the US – and South Korea and Japan, which met last week to ponder what to do. Earlier this month he ordered his military to prepare for “real war”. Is Kim waving or drowning, seeking attention or waxing desperate? Ignoring North Korea, which is unspoken western policy, stores up trouble. It’s difficult to tell from his lugubrious appearance but Xi Jinping, China’s newly anointed president for life, is a leader under severe pressure, too. His zero-Covid policy damaged a struggling economy and sparked something close to popular revolt. His aggressive foreign policy, debt diplomacy and rights abuses have produced a global anti-China backlash. By vowing to conquer US-backed Taiwan come what may, Xi has created another rod for his back. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which CIA director William Burns predicts may happen by 2027, is a probable nuclear flashpoint – especially if it goes badly for Xi. It’s estimated China has about 400 operational nuclear warheads, rising to approximately 1,000 by 2030. American nuclear-armed ships, submarines and bombers constantly patrol the western Pacific. For his part, Xi can point to continuing US and UK nuclear weapons modernisation, and to last week’s deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. China complained at the UN that the deal breached the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by transferring fissile material and nuclear technology to a non-nuclear weapons state. In an arrogant riposte, the US claimed it would actually strengthen non-proliferation efforts – without explaining how. Iran and others will register this double standard. The longstanding refusal of the main powers to disarm is the root cause of rising nuclear tensions – but irresponsible present-day political leaders greatly exacerbate the danger. “The United States and its allies … are faced with a choice,” wrote Lt Col Brent Stricker of the US Naval War College in a bleak assessment of the changing nuclear world order. They could either “restart arms limitation discussions to include both Russia and China, or restart the arms race”. The former course is wildly improbable at this juncture. So the old cold war-era nuclear helter-skelter ride towards mutually assured destruction looks set to resume and accelerate – under new, stressed-out management. Assuming no one presses the button first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T15:43:31Z","webTitle":"Spain renews call for US to remove soil from nuclear accident site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","fields":{"bodyText":"Nearly 60 years after a midair collision dumped four US hydrogen bombs in south-eastern Spain, strewing radioactive plutonium across the landscape, Spanish officials have renewed efforts to have Washington cart off tens of thousands of cubic metres of contaminated soil to the US for storage. A source at Spain’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed on Monday that it had formally requested the US takes action to remove the radioactive earth. The request is in line with a non-binding agreement struck between the two countries in 2015 and which included a US commitment to “arrange for disposal of the contaminated earth at an appropriate site in the United States”. As the US had yet to formally respond, the source declined to offer further details. El País, the Spanish newspaper that first reported the story, said the request had been lodged a few months ago. The US government did not respond to a request for comment. The demand is the latest chapter in a saga that traces back to January 1966 when a US B-52 bomber loaded with nuclear weapons collided with a tanker plane during a midair refuelling operation off the coast of Almeria, Spain. Seven of the two planes’ 11 crew members were killed. Four hydrogen bombs tumbled from the B-52; one was later recovered intact in the Mediterranean while the other three crashed on land near the coastal village of Palomares. While the bombs did not explode, two of the plutonium-filled detonators went off, scattering 7lb of radioactive plutonium-239 across the landscape. The US sent about 1,600 servicemen to the crash site to recover the weapons and clean up the contamination. About 1,400 tonnes of contaminated soil was shipped to a facility in South Carolina. Both countries were eager to downplay the collision, which took place during the height of the cold war and as Spain was in the grip of the Franco dictatorship. Amid fears that the risk of radioactive contamination would harm the country’s budding tourism industry, Spain’s then tourism minister and the US ambassador took a widely publicised swim in the sea off the coast of Palomares in the weeks after the incident. Concerns over the lingering impacts of the collision catapulted back into the spotlight in 2007, after a study suggested up to 50,000 sq metres of land remained contaminated. The affected area was fenced off and barred from being used for agriculture or development. In 2015 Madrid and Washington signed off on an agreement to negotiate a binding deal for the site’s remediation. “We have to build on today’s signing to take further action to resolve – once and for all – this very important issue,” the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, said during a joint press conference with the Spanish foreign minister at the time, José Manuel García-Margallo. Little was done to implement the agreement, however, as elections ushered in changes in Spain and the US. The Spanish government’s recent decision to take up the issue again with the US was prompted by the assessment that bilateral relations were “at their best in years,” sources told El País, leaving Madrid hopeful that some progress could be made before Spain heads to the polls for general elections at the end of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-01T12:58:58Z","webTitle":"The debt ceiling fight was never about debt. It was about Republican power | Mark Weisbrot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","fields":{"bodyText":"The debt ceiling drama seems to be nearing its end, as the US House of Representatives passed legislation that would lift the debt ceiling in accordance with a deal reached last weekend between Joe Biden, the president, and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House. The Republicans have been fighting to force cuts in spending and/or eligibility for food stamps (Snap), Medicaid, childcare and pre-schools, education and grants for higher education. By linking these and other provisions to the lifting of the debt ceiling, the Republicans tried to use the threat of default on the public debt to force Democrats to accept them. The legislation, which now goes to the Senate where it is expected to pass, did not satisfy most of their desires. The worst abuse that Republicans managed to include will be suffered by the hundreds of thousands of poor people who will likely lose access to food assistance under the Snap program. Many are in poor health and will not be able to complete the work requirements that Republicans have insisted on imposing for people of age 50-54; others will lose benefits due to additional red tape. There was also damage done by the fictitious narrative that Republicans were able to successfully promote about the “ticking time bomb” of the public debt. There is no bomb and if there were, it would not be ticking. The relevant measure of our debt burden is how much we pay annually in net interest on the debt, as a share of our national income (or roughly, GDP). That number was 1.9% for 2022. That is not big, by any comparison. We averaged about 3% in the 1990s, while experiencing America’s then longest-running economic expansion. The constant repetition of the “threat” posed by our national debt was a big win for Republicans, who are always looking to cut spending on social needs and safety nets; and more strategically important, to cut spending that could aid recovery from an economic downturn when Democrats are in power. In the Great Recession (December 2007 to June 2009), Republicans fought against measures to stimulate an economic recovery, which were already too small as proposed by Democrats. By October 2010, unemployment was still at 9.4%. In the election a month later, Republicans gained 63 seats to take the House and six Senate seats. The debt ceiling was used to threaten the Biden administration with a default on the public debt if they did not agree to Republican demands, mostly for spending cuts. The ceiling itself doesn’t affect new spending; it’s just holding up a chunk of the spending that our government is already obligated by law to carry out. In a democracy, this type of extortion should not be permitted. But Republican power isn’t based on democracy; on the contrary, it’s become highly dependent on institutions and practices that most people, including experts, would consider undemocratic or anti-democratic. Republicans benefit enormously from the fact that 80% of senators are elected by about 50% of voters. And if that’s not slanted enough, there is the filibuster, which effectively requires a 60-vote majority to win almost any pro-democracy reforms. This includes changes that are needed even for the Senate as presently constituted: eg representation for Washington DC, which has more population than a couple of states. We are the only democracy in the world where people who live in our national capital city don’t have full voting rights. Then there is voter suppression and gerrymandering, for both state and federal elections. These two methods of influencing election outcomes have gone hand-in-hand. Of course swing states are prime targets: recall that Republican presidents who ruled for 12 of the past 22 years came to power while losing the popular vote. When Republicans win, they then use their power to stack the cards further in their favor. This includes packing the judiciary, where Republican judges advance their agenda. Their decades-long struggle to control the judiciary reached its pinnacle with a 6-3 majority of the US supreme court, with five justices appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. The current Republican majority now “substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law”, the dissenting justices wrote when that majority revoked the right to abortion last year. Dozens of senators have described the supreme court as “captured” by “dark money” from Republican donors, including “rightwing billionaires”, and it is currently facing lost credibility as well as accusations of corruption. If the Republicans had gotten all that they had included in their legislation to lift the debt limit, it would have reduced the public debt by less than one half of 1% next year. This makes it even clearer that the debt ceiling fight was never really about debt reduction. It’s part of a vicious cycle in which political power is abused in order to consolidate a system that is increasingly undemocratic; and then further abused. The debt ceiling is just one part of that cycle, and should not have been negotiated; it needs to be abolished.

Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public. • This article was amended on 7 April 2022. An earlier version said “targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030”. That should have referred to offshore wind and domestic low-carbon energy sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T13:29:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 231 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region reported. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Vladimir Putin has said Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was now in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via it, the Russian president said in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power again for a period of time, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. Russian strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites, Zelenskiy said as he urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/may/19/rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-take-careful-approach-to-power-dressing-at-g7","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-19T16:28:38Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty take careful approach to G7 power dressing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/19/rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-take-careful-approach-to-power-dressing-at-g7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/may/19/rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-take-careful-approach-to-power-dressing-at-g7","fields":{"bodyText":"It is a question that many of us have struggled with. What to pack for an overseas work trip? For Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty’s visit to the G7 summit in Japan, the conundrum runs much deeper than whether they should share a suitcase. The duo may not have had to grapple with a limited baggage allowance, but as one of Britain’s wealthiest couples, and with everything they say as well as wear scrutinised, they do need to get a careful grip on the optics surrounding their fashion choices. Murty, who has until recently kept a low public profile, seems to be using the trip to showcase a new pragmatic approach to dressing. Gone are the £590 designer slippers and £1,650 Valentino leather coats. In their place, a range of labels, many from British brands. Descending the steps of a British Airways plane as the couple landed in Tokyo, Murty wore two British brands, a £275 bright pink cashmere top from Chinti &amp; Parker and neon green tailored trousers from Me+Em. Later, boarding a plane to travel to Hiroshima, she was pictured in a £675 sage coloured dress from the British brand Joseph, and carried a £375 mini bag from the Edinburgh-based brand Strathberry. Sunak appears to be sticking to his uniform of neat suiting, crisp white shirts and primary coloured ties. The Prada footwear is still there, too. However, this is also a carefully considered choice. Last August, at a Tory hustings in Darlington he was accused of “deliberately dressing down” when he wore shoes with a visible hole in the sole. Much safer this time around to stick to his tried and tested designer pieces and employ a cost per wear approach. There is a fine line between relatability and cosplay, which explains why we’ve seen Murty, a billionaire heiress, in an £85 blouse from Boden and £150 midi skirt from the French it-brand Sézane but have yet to see her in something from M&amp;S. Fashion insiders say Murty’s new power-dressing approach has been deployed after advice from the fashion consultant Isabel Spearman. Spearman was previously employed as a special adviser to Samantha Cameron during her husband’s tenure at 10 Downing Street. While Spearman hasn’t confirmed her involvement, Murty’s new arsenal of high/low brands is a strategy Cameron also embraced, with a wardrobe spanning Zara to Burberry. It’s an approach adopted by other political spouses, too. Michelle Obama regularly wore high-street brands such as J.Crew alongside designer labels such as Alexander McQueen, while Carrie Johnson rented much of her designer wardrobe. Murty has a natural interest in fashion, too, having previously helmed her own label, Akshata. “Ever since I was a little girl, I have always loved clothes,” she told Vogue India in 2011. “My mother, a no-nonsense engineer, was always baffled why I would spend so much time creating different outfits from my wardrobe.” So far, the brands Murty has chosen have reported a surge in demand. Her Rixo dress is sold out, while the Shropshire based-designer Claire Mischevani, who created Murty’s blue coronation dress, has had to add a disclaimer to her website, warning of delayed deliveries due to unprecedented orders. However, it’s Sunak who has caused the first item from a Japanese brand to sell out. On Thursday night, removing his shoes before a dinner with Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, as is customary in Japan, Sunak drew attention to his red socks emblazoned with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp logo, Kishida’s favourite baseball team. From a local shop in Hiroshima, they cost £8. After the pictures emerged the socks sold out in the red colour, both online and in-store."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-taking-a-20bn-gamble-on-nuclear-energy-and-carbon-capture","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T17:07:56Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt accused of ‘£20bn gamble’ on nuclear energy and carbon capture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-taking-a-20bn-gamble-on-nuclear-energy-and-carbon-capture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-taking-a-20bn-gamble-on-nuclear-energy-and-carbon-capture","fields":{"bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has been accused of wagering a “dangerous gamble on unproven technologies” in an effort to decarbonise Britain’s energy industry after ploughing more than £20bn into a series of projects. In his budget speech, the chancellor confirmed plans to spend the money over the next two decades on carbon capture and low carbon energy projects; announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. The government has created Great British Nuclear, a body designed to ease the creation of nuclear projects which are regularly delayed and over budget, and set a target for nuclear to “provide up to one quarter of our electricity by 2050”. Hunt, who has been under pressure to respond to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, said: “Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations.” However, climate campaigners attacked the drive, which had no giveaways for the solar or wind industries. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies? “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now. “Committing to £20bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.” Helen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: “This spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as ‘environmentally sustainable’ and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK’s commitment to climate leadership.” Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed £700m towards. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a “huge step forward for UK energy security and net zero”. But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: “There is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.” Britain’s energy industry has been under the spotlight since the war in Ukraine pushed already-high oil and gas prices higher. On Wednesday, Hunt confirmed a widely expected U-turn in on a planned cut to energy support for households. He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to £11bn, representing just a fifth of the £55bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell. The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by £4bn this year, and £10bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November. The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further £3bn “but much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recouped” over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:20:57Z","webTitle":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear energy watchdog has said the forces behind the shelling of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant are “playing with fire”, after a series of explosions shook the facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has experts based at Zaporizhzhia, reported on Sunday that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. It said its on-site experts saw some of the explosions from their windows. It reported more than a dozen blasts from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none so far critical for nuclear safety”. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said the news was extremely disturbing and he called the explosions completely unacceptable. “Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire,” he said. According to the IAEA Twitter account, Grossi renewed his appeal to Ukraine and Russia to agree and implement a nuclear safety and security zone around the plant as soon as possible. Zaporizhzhia, in south-east Ukraine, is Europe’s largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since March, although its Ukrainian staff remain in place to run the facility. It has faced repeated shelling, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. The plant’s six Soviet-designed water-cooled reactors are currently shut down, but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power that drives the cooling systems is shut. Shelling has frequently damaged the plant’s power supply. Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian forces were behind the latest attacks. “They are shelling not only yesterday but also today, they are shelling even now,” an adviser to the head of Russia’s nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, told the Russian state news agency Tass. He said there had been 15 aerial strikes, including one that hit a storage facility. Soon after the Russian accusations, Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom, said Russia was responsible for the shelling, which it said had resulted in 12 hits to Zaporizhzhia’s infrastructure. The company said on Telegram that the list of damaged equipment indicated that the attackers “targeted and disabled exactly the infrastructure that was necessary for the restart of 5th and 6th power units” and the restoration of power production for Ukrainian needs. Ukraine faces a collapse in its electricity supply after a relentless Russian bombing campaign targeted at power infrastructure. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has previously called for all troops to leave the plant so that it is under full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers. His government has called the attacks on the plant false-flag operations by Russia. Elsewhere in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces shelled civilian infrastructure in about a dozen communities, destroying 30 homes, the Ukrainian presidential office said on Sunday. Ukraine’s defence ministry published figures claiming that 84,210 Russian soldiers had been “eliminated” since the war began, including 330 in the last 24 hours. Ukraine also claimed Russia had lost 2,886 tanks, 5,817 armoured vehicles and 278 military jets. Separately, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine and Russia decline to publish their own military casualty figures, but earlier this month a senior US general estimated there had been “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded”, and a similar number on the Ukrainian side. Meanwhile, Ukraine promised to investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but that it was “very unlikely” the clips showed what Russia claimed, Associated Press reported. The UN’s human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has called for further investigation, which Stefanishyna said Ukraine had “no problem” with. On Sunday, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency said negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”. Mykhailo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given the series of major military victories achieved by Kyiv. “Any conspiracy theories about ‘surrender’ or west’s secret negotiations with Putin do not take into account ‘small detail’. Ukrainians,” he tweeted. “Ukraine will not kneel to Russians. It is not a matter of politics. It is a matter of our existence.” His statement follows recent US media reports that some senior US officials have privately told Kyiv to be open to negotiations with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/15/clinging-to-power-does-not-make-dianne-feinstein-a-feminist-hero","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T17:59:47Z","webTitle":"Clinging to power does not make Dianne Feinstein a feminist hero | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/15/clinging-to-power-does-not-make-dianne-feinstein-a-feminist-hero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/15/clinging-to-power-does-not-make-dianne-feinstein-a-feminist-hero","fields":{"bodyText":"Feinstein’s feminist farce Here’s a controversial opinion: when you’re no longer capable of doing your extremely important job you should gracefully step away from your extremely important job. I know that may not sound controversial on the surface, but it appears to be quite the topic of debate in Washington DC. It certainly seems to be a contentious issue for Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, who recently hit back at calls for the 89-year-old Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein to resign over her health. Feinstein is the oldest sitting US senator (narrowly beating out spring chicken Chuck Grassley who is a few months younger) and there have been concerns about her cognitive health for a while now. Her physical health has also become an issue: Feinstein has been absent from the Senate since February, when she was diagnosed with shingles. She’s missed 60 of the Senate’s 82 votes so far this session. Her absence from the judiciary committee, on which the Democrats hold a one-seat majority, has stopped the Democrats from advancing federal judges for confirmation. Which is a big deal because these judges get lifetime appointments. On Wednesday, multiple Democrats, led by Representative Ro Khanna, called for Feinstein to resign, saying she could no longer fulfil her duties. Not everyone agrees. “I don’t know what political agendas are at work that are going after Senator Feinstein in that way,” Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday. “I’ve never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way.” Norma Torres, another California Democrat, also argued that calls for Feinstein to quit were sexist. “When women age or get sick, the men are quick to push them aside,” she tweeted. “When men age or get sick, they get a promotion.” Do female politicians face unfair double standards and increased scrutiny? Of course they do! But cynically weaponizing the very real sexism that women in politics face to defend Feinstein’s stubborn decision to cling to power is appalling. Feminism isn’t about individual women climbing up the corporate ladder, it’s about working for equal rights. Feinstein represents 40 million Americans and her decisions affect millions more: there is nothing remotely feminist about Feinstein putting her ego above the greater good, particularly at such a critical moment for women’s rights in the US. It’s just selfish. I can understand why Feinstein doesn’t want to resign, don’t get me wrong. Being in government seems to have been very lucrative for her. She’s worth at least $58m. How did she get so rich in public service? Well, Feinstein’s husband was an investment banker and the pair have been incredibly lucky in the stock market. It’s almost like they’ve got access to inside information. Feinstein, for example, sold off a huge amount of shares just before the stock market collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic. The pair faced scrutiny over their stock trades but have denied doing anything wrong. Pelosi and her husband have faced similar scrutiny. Feinstein, to be fair, has now responded to criticism about her long absence from work. On Wednesday, following calls for her resignation Feinstein said that she’d asked the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, to allow another Democratic senator to take her place on the judiciary committee until she’s fit to return to work. That’s a good solution for now but Feinstein, who is due to step down in 2025, should think about resigning altogether: she can certainly afford retirement. Real leadership, as Jacinda Ardern has demonstrated, isn’t about staying in power as long as possible, but knowing when it’s time to step aside. It’s way past time for Feinstein to cede some space and make way for fresh leadership. Women are earning more money, but still doing the bulk of the housework Men still tend to be the primary breadwinner in heterosexual marriages, but the number of women who earn as much as or significantly more than their husband has roughly tripled over the past 50 years. In 29% of US marriages, spouses earn the same amount. And in 16% of heterosexual marriages women earn more. But despite growing equality in the workplace, women are still doing more of the housework and caregiving while men spend more time relaxing, a new report by Pew Research Center has found. Rupert Murdoch reportedly divorced Jerry Hall by email Hall, the billionaire’s fourth wife, was waiting to meet her husband at their home when she received a curt message saying: “we have certainly had some good times, but I have much to do.” Spanish woman emerges after spending 500 days living alone in cave She has now broken the world record for the longest time a person has spent alone in a cave.

MPs said the messages were part of a “culture of the regime” and accused members of Boris Johnson’s administration of being “drunk on power”. They said there had been a widespread tactic of threatening public spending in constituencies – including during votes on lockdowns, on free school meals and later in order to discourage letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson. Hancock’s spokesperson said the discussion about threatening the funding of a health hub in James Daly’s Bury North constituency was never acted upon. One MP said there had been a trend of discussing the use of spending decisions to influence votes and that newer MPs – like Daly – were seen as “easy pickings” because they were new to Westminster and did not have a good network of senior colleagues to ask for advice. “It was a culture of that time,” the MP said. The messages between Hancock and his adviser, Allan Nixon, show the former health secretary agreeing with the suggestion “100%” that projects in constituencies should be used as ways to persuade MPs to vote for the tier system in December 2020. The leaks were unveiled in the Daily Telegraph’s investigation into Hancock’s leaked WhatsApp messages, named the Lockdown Files. The former Conservative party chair Jake Berry tweeted that Hancock “should be dragged to the bar of the House of Commons first thing tomorrow morning to be questioned on this”. Berry said that Hancock had said he “wants to weaponise provision of care to disabled children to try and force MPs to vote in a certain way”. “I actually think once you get to the point that you are weaponising the provision of care to disabled children, I think you have crossed the line and as a local MP and … as a father with a son with additional needs, I know how desperately provision of this sort of care is required in the local area,” Berry told Times Radio. “And I just think it’s an absolutely despicable and appalling way for Matt Hancock and his advisers to have behaved.” Downing Street said the whole context should be judged by the official Covid inquiry. Sunak’s spokesperson said: “Funding decisions are taken in line with strict guidelines to ensure value for money set out in the spending framework and ministers and departments are held accountable for those decisions.” The row predates a separate issue the following year where an MP made a complaint to the police about alleged tactics used by the whips to shore up support for Boris Johnson – including similar threats to constituency funds. The leaked WhatsApp messages were sent before a rebellion by more than 50 MPs against the regional tier system for lockdowns, with dozens of MPs expressing anger at the categorisation of their local areas and support for business. Hancock’s messages show they were keen to persuade MPs from the 2019 intake not to rebel, and whips had shared a spreadsheet of significant numbers of MPs who were unhappy. A source close to Hancock said on the same day 512 people had died. “Tens of thousands of lives were at stake. Of course Matt considered all options.” Daly, whose vote was considered to be at risk, had been campaigning for a public health hub in his constituency to benefit vulnerable people in the community. On 22 November, 10 days before the vote, Nixon wrote to Hancock: “I think we need to dangle our top asks over some of these 2019 intake MPs who are going off the boil this coming week. “Thoughts on me suggesting to Chief’s spads that they give us a list of the 2019 intakes thinking of rebelling. Eg James wants his Learning Disability Hub in Bury – whips call him up and say Health team want to work with him to deliver this but that’ll be off the table if he rebels.” Hancock replied “yes 100%” to the suggestion. A spokesperson for the former health secretary said: “The missing context here is vitally important because this vote was critical for saving lives. “What’s being accused here never happened, demonstrating the story is wrong, and showing why such a biased, partial approach to the evidence is a bad mistake, driven by those with a vested interest and an axe to grind. “The right place to consider everything about the pandemic objectively is in the public inquiry.” Daly told the Telegraph the hub had still not been given the green light but said he was not contacted by the whips to make such threats. He said: “They were never proposing to give it to me. I still don’t have it. Even though I have repeatedly campaigned for it, Hancock never showed the slightest bit of interest in supporting it. I think it is appalling. “The fact that they would only give a much-needed support for disabled people if I voted for this was absolutely disgusting.” On 2 December, the day of the vote, Hancock messaged to say: “James Daly is with us.” Daly voted against the government. In total, 55 Conservative MPs opposed the system, which passed because Labour abstained. Conservative whips were accused of using similar tactics during the Johnson era. The former Conservative MP Christian Wakeford, who defected to Labour, alleged party whips told him he would lose funding for a new high school in his constituency if he did not vote with the government. William Wragg urged MPs to report government ministers, whips and advisers to the speaker – and even the police – for what he claimed was attempted blackmail of some colleagues suspected of possibly opposing Johnson during the Partygate scandal. Police took no further action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T04:51:36Z","webTitle":"Aukus: 10 things we need to know about Australia’s nuclear submarine program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is preparing to make the most significant announcement since he took office, joining the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, to unveil the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan on Tuesday morning AEDT. For now, many questions remain unanswered. Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday. 1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all? None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the long-term submarine program cost at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an interview with Guardian Australia in January, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is opposing modest savings. 2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines? The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once? The Guardian reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, Reuters reported Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met. 4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs? The government – and the chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released. 5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control? Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces. 6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it? Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – expressed confidence the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada. 7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state? This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap. 8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region? This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important. 9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service? The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process. 10. How does the plan fit with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water? The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T18:48:34Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy urges Nato to protect nuclear sites from ‘sabotage’ as Russia warns of risk of accident – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling over the weekend, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The head of Russia’s state-run atomic energy agency, Rosatom, warned of the risk of a nuclear accident at the Zaporizhzhia plant. Alexei Likhachev accused Ukraine of being willing to “accept” a “small nuclear incident”, adding that “everything must be done so that no one has in their minds to encroach on the safety of the nuclear power plant.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, said the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant was a Russian tactic that aimed to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said the forces behind the shelling of the plant were “playing with fire”. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station before troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city earlier this month. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation of the region. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. The Kremlin said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said there were no plans to call up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following, I’ll be back tomorrow. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has condemned the shelling of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a statement after the call, Macron said other nuclear plants at Rovno and Khmelnitski as well as the Nova Kakhovka dam had also been targeted. He added that President Zelenskiy had thanked France for its continuous support for the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian leader said he “stressed the need of demilitarisation” at the Zaporizhzhia facility, and said the pair “discussed cooperation on ensuring Ukraine’s energy stability, in particular, protecting the system from air attacks”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the recently liberated city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine. Luxembourg has said it will send additional armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to its defence minister, François Bausch. Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. Read the full story here: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far” and called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to allow crucial supplies to be sent to all areas of Ukraine. The WHO has documented 703 attacks on health infrastructure since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, said the organisation’s regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge. In a speech in Kyiv, Kluge described such attacks as a “breach of international humanitarian law and the rules of war”. The attacks on health and energy infrastructure have left hundreds of hospitals and healthcare facilities “no longer fully operational, lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs”, he said. He said: This winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine. The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukrainian health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine. He warned “cold weather can kill” as 10 million in Ukraine are without power in temperatures that are expected to drop to -20C in parts of the country. Ukraine’s health system is facing its darkest days in the war so far. Having endured more than 700 attacks, it is now also a victim of the energy crisis. He also called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. The WHO and its partners would be “ready to mobilise at a moment’s notice” to create routes to allow crucial supplies to be sent to areas that are hard to reach. He expressed particular concern for 17,000 patients in Donetsk, who he said may soon run out of critical antiretroviral drugs that keep them alive. Kluge added: This war must end, before the health system and the health of the Ukrainian nation are compromised any further. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said the forces behind the shelling of the plant were “playing with fire”. The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city.

Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. In a video address to Nato’s parliamentary assembly in Madrid, he said: All our nations are interested in not having any dangerous incidents at our nuclear facilities. He added: We all need guaranteed protection from Russian sabotage at nuclear facilities. Zelenskiy also called for new EU sanctions against Russia over what he said was its “policy of genocide” as its forces bomb civilian infrastructure. An interesting dispatch from Reuters news agency’s Gleb Garanich and Yuriy Kovalenko, reporting from the village of Horenka, near Kyiv. The piece reads: As they head into a cold winter, residents of a bombed-out Ukrainian village say they appreciate a warm bath in a mural painted by graffiti artist Banksy. The mural, showing a man scrubbing his back in a bathtub, is on the ground floor of what remains of an apartment block hit in a Russian attack in March in Horenka, northwest of Kyiv, once on the front line where Russia’s assault on the capital was halted. “For me, it means washing off all the dirt. The dirt of the Russian Federation ...,” Tetiana Reznychenko, 43, told Reuters as snow fell around her. “And this drawing makes me feel as if I have cleansed myself of the dirt that descended on us.” The mural is one of one of seven that Banksy has confirmed painting in Ukraine. Reznychenko said she had given Banksy’s team a mug of instant coffee in her apartment, as it was cold when the artist came to paint the mural. She has a wood stove in her apartment but no electricity, heating or running water as winter sets in. “Winter has begun, and we don’t know what will happen next. Firemen brought us non-drinking water ... but it will freeze unless we move it inside,” she said. Despite the problems, she and her neighbours remain defiant. “Ukrainians adapt to everything. No light? No problem. There are candles, there are alternative sources of electricity, there are power banks,” said neighbour Olena Kulynovich. “When the neighbours have electricity, we go to them, charge the phones and the power banks. No water? That’s OK. Even if the government doesn’t help, we managed to organise the delivery of water.” A Ukrainian serviceman kneels in front of a memorial dedicated to people who died in clashes with security forces, at the Independent Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, today. The landfill site on the edge of Kherson offers some visible hints here and there, among the piles of rubbish, to what locals and workers say happened in its recent past. Russian flags, uniforms and helmets emerge from the putrid mud, while hundreds of seagulls and dozens of stray dogs scavenge around. As the Russian occupation of the region was on its last legs over the summer, the site, once a mundane place where residents disposed of their rubbish, became a no-go area, according to Kherson’s inhabitants, fiercely sealed off by the invading forces from presumed prying eyes. The reason for the jittery secrecy, several residents and workers at the site told the Guardian, was that the occupying forces had a gruesome new purpose there: dumping the bodies of their fallen brethren, and then burning them. The residents report seeing Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a terrifying stench of burning flesh. They believe the Russians were disposing of the bodies of its soldiers killed during the heavy fighting of those summer days. “Every time our army shelled the Russians there, they moved the remains to the landfill and burned them,” says Iryna, 40, a Kherson resident. Read the full story here: Norway has said it will assist Ukraine with gas procurement for the coming winter, providing funding amounting to 2bn Norwegian crowns (£166m). The funds, part of a previously announced aid package of 10bn crowns, will go via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In a statement, Norway’s finance minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum said: It is important to channel the support through an established, internationally recognised organisation, which will ensure effective and transparent use of the funding. The head of Russia’s state-run atomic energy agency, Rosatom, has warned of the risk of a nuclear accident at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Rosatom CEO, Alexei Likhachev, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying: The plant is at risk of a nuclear accident. We were in negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all night. Rosatom has controlled the nuclear facility, Europe’s largest, since President Vladimir Putin ordered the formal seizure of the plant. Likhachev’s warning came amid renewed shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant, following reports from the IAEA that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. More than a dozen blasts have been reported from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none so far critical for nuclear safety”, the IAEA said. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. Likhachev accused Ukraine of being willing to “accept” a “small nuclear incident”, adding: This will be a precedent that will forever change the course of history. Therefore, everything must be done so that no one has in their minds to encroach on the safety of the nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city before its troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city earlier this month. In an update posted on Facebook, it said officials had inspected “four premises” where Russian troops “illegally detained people and brutally tortured them”. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station in the captured city. The statement continued: Parts of rubber batons, a wooden bat, a device used by the Russians to torture civilians with electric shocks, an incandescent lamp and bullets from the walls were recovered. People in cells and basements were subjected to various methods of torture, physical and psychological violence. Inside the basement of one of the sites, officials “discovered part of a metal-plastic pipe, handcuffs”, it said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine was in a “much better condition” than Russia to keep fighting through the winter. Speaking during a press conference in Indonesia, Austin said: We’ve done a lot to try to prepare the Ukrainians to be prepared for a fight in the winter, and enable them to continue to keep pressure on our adversaries throughout the winter months. He added that it was “hard to predict how things will evolve and on what timeline, but we’re in this in support of Ukraine for as long as it takes”. The Kremlin has said there are no plans to call up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Asked about the potential for a new round of mobilisation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: I can’t speak for the defence ministry, but there are no discussions in the Kremlin about this. President Vladimir Putin announced plans to draft 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine in September, marking Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war following a string of military defeats. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced the end to the “partial mobilisation” in October. A Ukrainian official has said the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is a Russian tactic that aims to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. Strikes on the plane on Saturday and Sunday amount to a “genocidal campaign to freeze Ukrainians to death, to deprive Ukrainians of electricity”, said Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister. Russia is trying to “freeze the front” because they “are not achieving anything on the battlefield and they’re desperately looking for a way to achieve what they call an operational pause on the front”, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. He said there would be “no pause from our side” and that Ukraine will continue its recent counter-offensive. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks on the Zaporizhzhia facility in south-east Ukraine, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since March. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena, have been pictured attending a commemoration ceremony in Kyiv at a monument to the so-called “Heavenly Hundred” for the people killed during the Ukrainian pro-EU mass demonstrations in 2013/2014. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Russia also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region.

With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. A video purportedly showing the detention of two Russian servicemen who refused to fight against Ukraine has appeared across multiple Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels. The video shows two men – each dressed in military uniform – called to appear in front of their commander. Italy’s government will ask parliament to pass a new law on military and civilian supplies to Ukraine throughout 2023, defence minister Guido Crosetto said in an interview. The Rome government can send aid to Ukraine without seeking parliamentary authorisation each time on the basis of a decree that expires at the end of the year. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. Ukraine has exported almost 16.2m tonnes of grain so far in the 2022-23 season, down 31.7% from the 23.8m tonnes exported by the same stage of the previous season, agriculture ministry data showed. The volume included almost 6.3m tonnes of wheat, 8.6m tonnes of corn and 1.3m tonnes of barley, Reuters reported. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson remains without electricity, running water or heating, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Emmanuel Macron has accused Russia of feeding disinformation to further its “predatory project” in Africa, where France has had military setbacks. In an interview with TV5 Monde on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked Ukraine’s annual Day of Dignity and Freedom on Monday by celebrating the sacrifices made by Ukrainian people since Russia’s invasion and said his country would endure and prevail. In a video address to the nation, Zelenskiy hailed the contributions made by Ukrainians, from soldiers, firefighters and medics to teachers giving online lessons, villagers cooking for the military, tailors sewing uniforms and farmers ploughing their fields despite the risk. He hailed their defiance despite frequent missile strikes, widescale destruction, shortages and rolling blackouts as winter sets in, almost exactly nine months since Russia’s invasion, Reuters reported. “We can be left without money. Without gasoline. Without hot water. Without light. But not without freedom,” Zelenskiy said in an address that he delivered standing in an ornate room in the presidential palace in the capital, Kyiv. The Kremlin also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. “There is no doubt that Russia itself will be looking for the perpetrators of this crime. They must be found and punished,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European integration was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that Kyiv would investigate the video but that it was “very unlikely” it showed what Moscow claimed. A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office told Reuters it was looking into the footage and called for allegations to be investigated promptly and in full. The Kremlin has said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. “This cannot but cause our concern,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We call on all countries of the world to use their influence so that the Ukrainian armed forces stop doing this.” Ukraine says it was Russia that shelled the plant. Reuters was unable to independently verify which side was responsible. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. Ukraine has exported almost 16.2m tonnes of grain so far in the 2022-23 season, down 31.7% from the 23.8m tonnes exported by the same stage of the previous season, agriculture ministry data showed. The volume included almost 6.3m tonnes of wheat, 8.6m tonnes of corn and 1.3m tonnes of barley, Reuters reported. After an almost six-month blockade caused by the Russian invasion, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked at the end of July under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Ministry data showed that 3m tonnes of various grains were exported in the first 20 days of November, 29.7% less than in the same period of November 2021. The government has said Ukraine could harvest between 50m and 52m tonnes of grain this year, down from a record 86m tonnes in 2021 because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower yields. Ukrainians living in the capital, Kyiv, are preparing for the “worst winter of their lives” with temperatures set to plummet and the nation’s power grid a target for Russian attacks. Here is an extract from an Associated Press article today: When the power is out, as it so often is, the high-rise apartment overlooking Ukraine’s war-torn capital feels like a deathtrap. No lights, no water, no way to cook food. And no elevator by which to escape from the 21st floor should a Russian missile strike. Even when electricity comes back, it’s never on for long. “Russian strikes are plunging Ukraine into the Stone Age,” says Anastasia Pyrozhenko. In a recent 24-hour spell, her 26-story high-rise only had power for half an hour. She says the “military living conditions” have driven her and husband from their apartment. “Our building is the highest in the area and is a great target for Russian missiles, so we left our apartment for our parents’ place and are preparing for the worst winter of our lives,” said the 25-year-old. The situation in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other major cities has deteriorated drastically following the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrainian state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo reported that 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties, due to damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across the country. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, the network said that “resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, too, stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout: “Worst case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we (do not) have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” Klitschko told the AP on Friday. Ukrainian soldiers fire an artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut, Donetsk region, Ukraine. Italy’s government will ask parliament to pass a new law on military and civilian supplies to Ukraine throughout 2023, defence minister Guido Crosetto said in an interview. The Rome government can send aid to Ukraine without seeking parliamentary authorisation each time on the basis of a decree that expires at the end of the year. “The defence [ministry] will shortly propose to renew that same measure, extending it to all of 2023,” Crosetto told Il Foglio newspaper. Crosetto said Italy would continue supplying arms, as it has done in the past, “in the times and ways that we will agree with our Atlantic allies and with Kyiv”. Crosetto belongs to Brothers of Italy, the right wing party of Italy’s new prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. Moldova is believed to have taken more refugees per head than any other country. Largely dependent on Russia energy supplies, Moldova is facing more difficulties with winter arriving and Moscow cutting natural gas supplies by about 40%, hurting its ability to supply enough electricity to its population. “Moldova is directly impacted because it’s dependent on Russian energy supplies and is a country which has a part of its territory controlled by Russian soldiers so it’s especially vulnerable,” a French diplomat told reporters in a briefing. Aid would be used to support Moldova’s budget and electricity supplies as well as the costs for hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. Russian leaders will highly likely see retaining control of Svatove as a political priority though their commanders are likely struggling with the military realities of maintaining a credible defence, while also attempting to resource offensive operations further south in Donetsk. “Both Russian defensive and offensive capability continues to be hampered by severe shortages of munitions and skilled personnel,” the report adds. A video purportedly showing the detention of two Russian servicemen who refused to fight against Ukraine has appeared across multiple Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels. The video shows two men – each dressed in military uniform – called to appear in front of their commander. According to Meduza, an independent Russian news outlet based abroad, who shared the video published by the Military Ombudsman Telegram channel on Sunday, the incident occurred in Russia’s Belgorod region. The outlet states: The investigator informs the privates that on 16 November a criminal case was opened against them for failure to comply with the order (Part 2.1 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). This article implies a punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of two to three years. The convoy then detains the soldiers.” Human rights activists believe that this video was filmed “as a warning to others”. Residents of Kherson waved Ukrainian flags to celebrate the arrival of the first train to arrive in the southern city since the start of the Russian invasion. Images published over the newswires today show a train carrying passengers from Kyiv roll into Kherson on Saturday for the first time in more than eight months. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. A statement published by the IAEA late on Sunday read: Repeated shelling at the site of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) yesterday evening and this morning damaged buildings, systems and equipment, with some of the explosions occurring near the reactors.” The agency said the plant was hit with “more than a dozen blasts within 40 minutes” though radiation levels at the site remained normal and there were no reports of casualties. The ZNPP’s external power supplies, which have been knocked out several times during the conflict, were also not affected. According to the IAEA experts, site management reported damage in several places, including a radioactive waste and storage building, cooling pond sprinkler systems, an electrical cable to one of the reactors, condensate storage tanks, and to a bridge between another reactor and its auxiliary buildings. Rafael Grossi added: Even though there was no direct impact on key nuclear safety and security systems at the plant, the shelling came dangerously close to them. We are talking metres, not kilometres. Whoever is shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, is taking huge risks and gambling with many people’s lives.” The IAEA team of experts plan to conduct an assessment on Monday of the shelling impact on the site. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high. Luhansk region - little by little we are moving forward with battles. As of now, there have been almost 400 shelling occasions in the east since the beginning of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from the southern city of Kherson. Referring to Ukrainian positions in the south, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s forces “are holding the line, consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers.” Russia’s surge in missile strikes in Ukraine is partly designed to exhaust Kyiv’s supplies of air defences and achieve dominance of the skies, a senior Pentagon official said on Saturday.

Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. “We have offered Poland support in securing airspace – with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,” Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon’s Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. Ukraine has denied its forces executed Russian prisoners of war, arguing its soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian servicemen killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was “aware of the videos” and was “looking into them”. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson remains without electricity, running water or heating, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Emmanuel Macron has accused Russia of feeding disinformation to further its “predatory project” in Africa, where France has had military setbacks. In an interview with TV5 Monde on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. Macron said: “A number of powers, who want to spread their influence in Africa, are doing this to hurt France, hurt its language, sow doubts, but above all pursue certain interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/26/labor-extends-gas-price-cap-to-2025-to-protect-power-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-26T01:28:04Z","webTitle":"Labor extends gas price cap to 2025 to protect power bills ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/26/labor-extends-gas-price-cap-to-2025-to-protect-power-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/26/labor-extends-gas-price-cap-to-2025-to-protect-power-bills","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government will extend its price cap on wholesale gas prices until at least mid-2025 in an attempt to limit soaring energy costs. It will also offer exemptions for producers in the domestic market if they can deliver enforceable promises to maintain a certain level of supply. The price limit extension is part of the final consultation planned for a mandatory code of conduct for the gas industry, released on Monday. “The gas code will ensure sufficient supply of Australian gas for Australian users at reasonable prices, give producers the certainty they need to invest in supply, and ensure Australia remains a reliable trading partner by allowing LNG producers to meet their export commitments,” the energy minister, Chris Bowen, the resources minister, Madeleine King, and the industry minister, Ed Husic, said in a joint statement. “Coupled with action to cap coal costs for power generators, gas price caps under the Government’s Energy Price Relief Plan nearly halved wholesale energy prices.” However, Bowen’s office said the coal price cap will cease when its 12-month period ends. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The gas industry had objected strongly to the government’s intervention last December when it imposed a $12 per gigajoule price cap for domestic sales. It also set a separate $125/tonne limit on black coal for Queensland and New South Wales, with both caps intended to work to curb the run-up in electricity prices. The size of the effect of the price caps on power prices is contested. While wholesale prices have been lower since December, they typically account for only about a third of users’ bills and those costs are still set to rise as much as a third from July. The government also indicated it was prepared to grant gas companies exemptions under certain conditions – with details of the code to be finalised before the end of June. The $12/GJ gas prices will be assessed by a review to start by 1 July 2025, implying the cap may extend beyond that time. In the meantime it will allow companies that satisfy the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with “court-enforceable supply commitments” to become exempt from the cap. Small producers that direct their supply only to the domestic market will also dodge the cap. The mix of carrots and sticks include giving the ACCC “a strong enforcement regime” for the new gas code. The measures, once introduced, will be reviewed within two years. Companies and other stakeholders have until 12 May to make submissions. One area of uncertainty will be how the government determines and imposes its “reasonable” price test on new gas projects. Guardian Australia sought details from the government about the planned price cap for black coal. Industry has provided a mixed response. Andrew Richards, the chief executive of the Energy Users’ Association of Australia, called the policy a “welcome step in the right direction” but said more work needed to be done for big energy consumers. “There is still much to do to finalise the code and, importantly, detailed design of the regulations will be critical to ensuring the intent of the code is able to be delivered,” Richards said. “We look forward to working constructively with the ACCC, government and the gas producers as they finalise this critical code.” The association said many of its members continued to struggle to sign gas contracts this year even with the price caps in place. The Australian Pipelines and Gas Association said the government’s proposed mandatory code would “help rebalance the domestic gas market, but concerns remain that it will not do enough to alleviate underlying supply issues”. “Gas-fired generation will be vitally important to ensure the ongoing security of the national electricity market as coal-fired generation exits and more intermittent renewables come online,” Steve Davies, the group’s CEO, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/29/sizewell-c-confirmed-again-this-time-it-might-be-the-real-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T18:47:31Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C ‘confirmed’ again – this time it might be the real deal | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/29/sizewell-c-confirmed-again-this-time-it-might-be-the-real-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/29/sizewell-c-confirmed-again-this-time-it-might-be-the-real-deal","fields":{"bodyText":"Another day, another “confirmation” that the government plans to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk – surely the “most announced” project in UK infrastructure history. The latest update, though, contained a genuine sign of seriousness: the Chinese are being paid to go away. China General Nuclear (CGN), a state-backed firm, owned a 20% stake in the fledgling project and had, in effect, a right to subscribe to maintain its holding through the various funding rounds – just as it did at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. In practice, any form of Chinese involvement in Sizewell has been impossible for at least a year. First, because David Cameron’s misguided “golden era” of coziness with Beijing is over, as Rishi Sunak said earlier this week. Second, because the mere presence of a Chinese firm would scare away many of the private investors, especially US ones, that the government is relying upon to fund Sizewell’s construction phase; in turn, the costs of funding for the project might have ballooned. In its usual less-than-straightforward way, the government declined to say how much of its £679m fresh funding for Sizewell (giving the UK state a 50% stake now) will be directed at buying out CGN. But, if £100m-ish is correct, the negotiating outcome could be called reasonable – or, at least, pragmatic. We have no idea what CGN has spent so far, but a 20% stake in an unbuilt Sizewell clearly has some value. The bottom line is that CGN had to be cleared out to get beyond the planning stage. The point at which the project will be truly “confirmed” is when other investors have committed the hard equity capital to fund construction. That moment is still a year away and the job probably involves finding £8bn-ish to allow an even greater sum to be borrowed on top. It is not a small task. And the cost of equity and cost of borrowing will be the critical numbers in terms of value for money for bill-payers. But Sizewell – for better or worse – is starting to look credible. EasyJet not quite out of the turbulence There’s nothing like a strong summer to excite easyJet’s management and, sure enough, chief executive Johan Lundgren was dancing down the aisle as he unveiled numbers for the last financial year. “EasyJet has achieved a record bounce back this summer with a performance which underlines that our transformation is delivering,” he declared. The July-September period, in which profits were £674m on a flattering operating measure, delivered “the highest-ever earnings for a single quarter”. Very good, but one good quarter followed about 10 rotten ones. EasyJet still produced a headline loss for the year of £178m – its third loss-making year in a row. The pandemic is to blame, obviously, but there is a lesson here in not chalking up a turnaround before it has become permanent. Lundgren was guilty of premature optimism in the spring; weeks of airport chaos and cancelled flights followed. There is a stronger case now that a corner has been turned, but you can’t blame the stock market for being wary; easyJet’s shares were 550p as recently as late April but are now 383p. Cost of living pressures will bite properly next year and all airlines are now facing a period of higher prices for aviation fuel. While peak holiday weeks such as Christmas are reported to be back to normal levels of demand, Lundgren also said that “visibility over bookings in the second half [post-April] remains low”. EasyJet is improving, but it hasn’t reached comfortable cruising altitude. Shining a light on the mini-budget It’s ancient history now, but Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget was even more chaotic than we knew already. That, at least, was the gist of the testimony of Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, to a House of Lords select committee on Tuesday. Normal form requires the Treasury to brief the Bank about the contents of a big fiscal announcement, but Bailey clearly didn’t get a full picture. “I’m afraid there were parts of it we had no idea what was in it,” he said. Why? “I don’t think Treasury officials were clear what was going to be in it.” The timing of these interactions with Threadneedle Street, note, was the day before Kwarteng’s big announcement. One gets an impression of the former chancellor wavering until the 11th hour about whether to adopt radical measures such as scrapping the 45p additional rate of income tax. One could say it is almost unbelievable – except that it is an entirely plausible version of events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/25/paddy-power-fined-push-notifications-sent-to-gambling-self-excluding","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T13:25:14Z","webTitle":"Paddy Power fined after push notifications sent to people self-excluding from gambling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/25/paddy-power-fined-push-notifications-sent-to-gambling-self-excluding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/25/paddy-power-fined-push-notifications-sent-to-gambling-self-excluding","fields":{"bodyText":"The bookmaker Paddy Power sent a promotional push notification to customers who had signed up to exclude themselves from gambling, inviting them to bet on a football match. The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, said PPB Counterparty Services, trading as Paddy Power and Betfair, would pay £490,000 for breaching social responsibility rules. The fine relates to material sent to customers who had signed up to Gamstop, a nationwide scheme that gamblers can use to voluntarily block themselves from betting sites, often in response to concerns they may be addicted. Gambling operators are supposed to remove anyone who signs up to Gamstop from their marketing databases within two days, under the conditions of British gambling licences. But on 21 November 2021, due to “human error”, self-excluded Paddy Power customers with an Apple device were sent a notification advertising the opportunity to bet on Tottenham Hotspur v Leeds United. The Gambling Commission did not say how many people received the message. Paddy Power Betfair, owned by global gambling operator Flutter, is the latest in a string of operators to pay a penalty this year for failing to act in a socially responsible way. Previous penalties include a record £19.2m fine meted out to William Hill for “widespread and alarming” failures, including allowing customers to lose tens of thousands of pounds within minutes of opening an account. The litany of failings has emerged despite increased scrutiny on the £10bn-a-year sector, as the government drew up proposals for tighter regulation. The resulting white paper, published last month, generally envisages a crackdown on online gambling, including tougher affordability checks and limits on online slot machine stakes. But most of the proposals have been put out to a year-long consultation. Paddy Power initially appealed against a higher penalty related to its transgression, before agreeing to pay a £490,000 penalty on condition that it dropped the appeal. The company will also hire an independent third party to carry out an audit of its marketing processes. Ian Brown, chief executive of Flutter in the UK and Ireland, said: “Flutter’s ambition is to lead the industry in safer gambling and we apologise for this mistake. The push notification in question was sent in error and, once discovered by our team, we took immediate steps to rectify the issue and proactively notified the Gambling Commission.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T10:40:25Z","webTitle":"Inter claim Coppa Italia and offer City a glimpse of their knockout power | Nicky Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","fields":{"bodyText":"Lautaro Martínez had not even got his hands on the trophy and already they were asking him about the next one, his TV interviewer rushing through a conversation about the Coppa Italia Inter retained on Wednesday night to get to a question about the Champions League final in Istanbul. “I want to keep going,” said the Argentinian. “I want to keep on winning.” He has established quite a habit. In the last six months, Martínez has claimed three trophies – starting with a World Cup in Qatar last December, following up with a Supercoppa, and now the Coppa Italia. His first goal cancelled out an early deficit for Inter against Fiorentina, the second secured a 2-1 win. The Nerazzurri were favourites for this final, but anyone who imagined it to be a formality could not have been paying attention. Fiorentina beat them at San Siro in April and were drawing with them as late as the 94th minute of their previous league game. Vincenzo Italiano has shaped the Viola into a relentless, in-your-face team who navigated to the finals of this competition and the Europa Conference League. Italiano was described by one former sporting director as a “little [Pep] Guardiola” and has named the Manchester City manager as his inspiration. His Fiorentina team press from the front without the ball and build from the back with it, with centre-backs as auxiliary playmakers. Wednesday’s opening goal was an example of what it looks like when it works. Inter gave the ball away in a seemingly innocuous position and in the blink of an eye it had been advanced to Giacomo Bonaventura, who fed Jonathan Ikoné on the left corner of the box. He took one touch before nutmegging Matteo Darmian with a pass back across the area. Nico González arrived at full speed to finish on the far side. Since missing out on the World Cup triumph due to injury, Fiorentina’s Argentina winger has been making up for lost time. González’s return was instrumental in lifting his club out of a winter slump and he scored twice in the second leg of the Europa Conference League semi-final away against Basel last week, carrying them to a 5-4 aggregate win. On this occasion, however, Inter were quick to recover. Martínez equalised in the 29th minute, running on to Marcelo Brozovic’s through pass and drilling into the bottom corner. He put his team ahead in the 37th, volleying home brilliantly from Nicolò Barella’s cross. Those were his 100th and 101st goals for Inter but more importantly his ninth and 10th since the start of April – a figure bettered only by Karim Benzema and Callum Wilson in Europe’s top five leagues. The greatest criticisms of Martínez in Italy have centred on his streakiness, the way he seems to vanish for weeks at a time. When he is on form, he can look unstoppable. He was in that mode on Wednesday. Shortly before his equaliser, Martínez had shed the 6ft 5in Nikola Milenkovic like a twig catching his shoulder on a stroll through the woods, casually brushing him off before sending Edin Dzeko through on goal, only to see the Bosnian fire over the bar. Inter ought to have put the result beyond doubt. They had further chances either side of the interval, Romelu Lukaku entering the game and testing the Fiorentina goalkeeper Pietro Terracciano himself before presenting Robin Gosens with an open goal after bulldozing to the byline on the right. The German, under pressure from Dodô, could not hit the target. And then they nearly blew it. Luka Jovic, on as a 70th-minute substitute for Fiorentina, executed the smoothest of drag-backs to wrong-foot Darmian, but could not beat Samir Handanovic at the near post. The striker should have done much better moments later, when Dodô’s cross found him unmarked, but his header sailed harmlessly across the face of goal. The emotions at full time showed how much this cup meant on both sides. Several Fiorentina players were in tears, overcome with exhaustion and frustration. This was their 57th game of a marathon season, and a chance to claim a first piece of silverware since 2001. They were painfully aware of how it might have ended differently had they taken their chances in the second half. Inter, meanwhile, celebrated retaining a trophy that validates the good work they have done under Simone Inzaghi. Their league form has been disappointing this season, a team expected to challenge for the title finding itself 20 points behind the leaders Napoli with two games to play, having lost 12 out of 36 games. They have lacked consistency but believe they can be a match for anyone when their focus is right. There is something about cup competitions that seems to bring the best out of them, and especially from their manager. Inzaghi had already won the Supercoppa twice and Coppa Italia once at Lazio. In two seasons at Inter, he has a perfect record in both. The Nerazzurri have lost only a single game of knockout football out of the 20 they have played under Inzaghi: the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Liverpool last February. They won the return at Anfield but exited 2-1 on aggregate. Inter supporters may hold on to statistics such as these – another being that Inzaghi has won seven out of eight finals in his managerial career – as the Champions League showdown with Manchester City looms. The team itself cares less for statistics than the feelings of confidence that winning brings. “We know it will be really difficult,” said Hakan Calhanoglu of the final against City. “But it’s only one game. Of course we believe we can do it. We have believed ever since the start of the Champions League, after [the win against] Barcelona.” Fiorentina have a continental final of their own to come against Premier League opponents, West Ham, whose manager David Moyes was in attendance at the Stadio Olimpico. Italiano had acknowledged even before the Europa Conference League semi-final that he wanted to win that competition the most. “You can’t be defeated after a match like this one,” he said on Wednesday. “We played on a level footing with a Champions League finalist. We are really disappointed, but we will take lots of positives with us to Prague. We need to take revenge for ourselves and go there convinced we can bring that trophy home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T22:00:06Z","webTitle":"Anthony Watson hails power of visualisation in England return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Watson’s try for England against Wales last week came with a sense of deja vu. An obvious feeling of cathartic release, too, after spending so long out with injury, but underlying it all, a familiarity. For Watson had scored the try before, diving into the left-hand corner and dotting the ball down with his right hand. In fact, he had done so only days earlier during one of his visualisation blocks – a preparation method the 29-year-old winger swears by. “I don’t really judge my quality of games by tries but to be able to score in the corner was nice and something I had spent a lot of the week visualising,” he says. “That is how I try to calm myself down before games. It is weird how it happened exactly how I had pictured it. Literally in that corner, because I was playing on the left wing and it was finishing with the ball in my right hand in that kind of style.” Watson has been using visualisation techniques – as both a way to prepare for matches and cope with long-term injuries – for years. It started from his work with the renowned mind coach Don Macpherson and he does it a handful of times, 20 minutes on each occasion, in the buildup to a game. An NFL fan, Watson chuckles when it is put to him how the Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers recently spent four days in a darkness retreat – “I don’t think I’m ready for that” – but techniques such as those he does use are increasingly commonplace in sport. Wayne Rooney used to talk about having a “memory” before the game and would seek out the kit man to find out what colour he would be wearing to enhance the process, and Watson believes it is of increasing importance in rugby. “It has happened a few times when I have scored,” he says. “The power of visualisation is so important. I have scored tries and it has ended up exactly how I had it in my head. It starts off with just what it would look like from a bird’s eye view and then what it would feel like for me. It all starts with my work with Don Macpherson, that stuff puts me in good stead for what lies ahead and it just calms me. That is the only time I think about the game, in those periods of visualisation. It gives me blocks, periods of allowing myself to focus on what I need to then letting it go. “It is common now. There is a greater respect for the power of mental techniques to prepare for games. Everyone is different, what will be useful for some people and completely useless for others. I just found it really helpful in terms of blocking out periods to think about the game, and it allows me to be chilled out and do whatever I want to do outside that. More and more people are finding techniques that work for them, as opposed to trying to rev up to 100 five minutes before a game. “There is value in athletes just connecting back to themselves, but things move at a million miles an hour in sport and unfortunately you can get caught up in what [the media] writes, both positive and negative. I think that sometimes it’s important to step away from that entirely and remember who you are, not what people think you are.” Watson was making his first England start for almost two years against Wales having suffered a debilitating ACL injury in October 2021 before niggling calf, hamstring and quad problems struck at the wrong time as far as international windows were concerned. The road to recovery has been difficult but visualisation has helped along the way. “It’s something that I have done a bit with long-term injuries,” he says. “More to calm me down when thoughts start spiralling, that’s when I try to go back to that kind of stuff and come back to a more relaxed mindset. Sometimes it’ll be just to calm myself down, for sure. But most of the time it’s scheduled, I’ll know if I need to do it this evening or tomorrow evening. It’s on my own. If you saw me doing it you would probably think I look crazy!” With England enjoying a training camp in Brighton during the second fallow week of the Six Nations the focus has been on continuing Steve Borthwick’s rebuild before attentions turn to France’s visit to Twickenham when they reconvene in Bagshot on Monday. So what does Watson have planned for next Saturday? He laughs and insists the script has not been finalised, but France should be wary of a player finally fit again and reaping the rewards of seeing things differently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:44:50Z","webTitle":"Putin’s timeline for storing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is hard to believe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","fields":{"bodyText":"Like a lot of what Vladimir Putin says about nuclear weapons, his suggestion that Russia would start storing its bombs in Belarus may add up to less than it appears. In February last year, Putin said he was putting Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert, but there was no perceptible change in the country’s nuclear posture, or any unusual movements of its weapons. Putin and the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, have been hinting at some kind of nuclear basing arrangement for some time. Over a year ago, the Belarus leader staged a referendum to change the constitution to allow for that. What Putin is threatening this time is to take another couple of steps along that road, starting the training of Belarus aircrews in early April to pilot aircraft carrying nuclear bombs, and to finish storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons by 1 July. Nuclear experts are sceptical of such ambitious timelines, and point out that Russia has been working on a nuclear weapon storage facility in Kaliningrad for at least seven years and it is still not clear whether the bombs have actually arrived there. So far, no satellite imagery has surfaced that might suggest something similar is being built in Belarus. “I’ve looked around at some of the likely bases and I don’t see anything that indicates construction of a nuclear storage site,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. “But you can’t rule it out. You can bet a lot of people are combing over the country right now.” Putin had suggested a nuclear announcement was on the way earlier in the week, saying Russia would respond to Britain’s decision to supply armour-piercing shells to Ukraine made of depleted uranium. Such shells are toxic enough to require special handling and pose an environmental threat, but they are by no means nuclear weapons. In his remarks on Saturday, Putin did not dwell on the issue and attributed any such linkage to Lukashenko. Instead, he focused on a longstanding gripe of Moscow’s about the US nuclear-sharing arrangements with five of its allies: Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Turkey. Under that arrangement, the US stores B61 gravity bombs (about 100 in all) in those countries and their aircrews are trained to fly planes carrying them in the event of nuclear war. Russia argues this is a violation of the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and just last week, Putin’s joint statement with Xi Jinping said: “All nuclear-weapon states should refrain from deploying nuclear weapons abroad and withdraw nuclear weapons deployed abroad.” Putin’s announcement about Belarus suggests he has changed his mind about that principle since Tuesday. However, he can expect the global backlash to be muted due to widely shared impatience over many years with the US-Nato sharing arrangements. Those arrangements are not technically in violation of the NPT as they predated the treaty. The Soviet Union accepted them and at the time, Moscow could deploy its nuclear weapons in Belarus or any other of its republics. But when Belarus, Ukraine and the republics became independent, it lost that right. The US sharing deal with its allies, and the proposed Russian arrangement with Belarus, also get around NPT restrictions by not formally transferring the stored weapons to the host government until a war begins. For non-weapon states and arms control advocates, however, that is a cynical dodge and against the spirit of the NPT. The Obama administration contemplated withdrawal of the B61s from Europe as a move towards disarmament, but some European allies resisted any move that might suggest the nuclear umbrella was getting thinner, and then relations with Moscow worsened again. Rather than being removed, the bombs were modernised, and the new version, the B61-12, is in the process of being transferred to Europe. “The new bombs are a whole new wave of weapons coming in and that’s of grave concern to European populations,” said Susi Snyder, the programme coordinator of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “Putin calling this out and threatening to do the same thing is putting a spotlight on a problem that has existed for quite some time and that the rest of the world has also been trying to draw attention to and remedy.” Kristensen argued, however, that Putin has in large part himself to blame for the continued presence of B61s in Europe, through his seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014. He said: “There’s no doubt in my mind that if Putin had not started what he’s doing there in 2014, it’s very likely that the nuclear weapons would have been withdrawn by now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T14:14:58Z","webTitle":"Russia accused of taking Belarus ‘nuclear hostage’ with deal to station missiles there","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian president’s suggestions that the move would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak, another senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mocked Putin’s plan, saying the Russian leader was “too predictable”. “Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing &amp; all he can do is scare with tactics,” Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. Nato spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. “Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.” Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats or escalated nuclear rhetoric after the full invasion of Ukraine, but this is the first time he has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Earlier in the week, Putin threatened a response to Britain’s announcement that it would supply Ukraine with armour-piercing tank shells made with depleted uranium, and mentioned the shells again in his remarks on Saturday, but his justification of the move rested mainly on the presence of about 100 US nuclear bombs in Europe. “There is nothing unusual here either: firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,” Putin said. “They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries. We agreed that we will do the same, without violating our obligations – I emphasise, without violating our international obligations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.” Lukashenko staged a referendum in February last year, revoking Belarus’s non-nuclear status, but the opposition rejected the vote as meaningless under conditions of political repression and following the 2020 presidential election that kept him in office, generally agreed to have been rigged. “Russia’s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus directly violates the constitution of Belarus and grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to assume the non-nuclear state status expressed in the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus of 1990,” Tsikhanouskaya said. “This unacceptable development, making Belarus a potential target for preventive or retaliation strikes, became possible because of the illegal seizure of power by the illegitimate regime of Lukashenko.” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Belarus it could face further sanctions if it hosted Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions,” Borrell said in a tweet. Moscow has 5,977 nuclear warheads in its inventory, according to the Federation of American Scientists, and has long had the capability to strike a target anywhere in the world. The US has slightly fewer, at 5,428. The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation estimates that there are about 100 US nuclear weapons – airborne gravity bombs – stored in Europe across six bases in five countries, although they are retained in US control. The US played down concerns about Putin’s announcement and the potential for Moscow to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance,” a senior US administration official said. The official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a note late on Saturday that the risk of escalation to nuclear war remained “extremely low”. They said: “ISW continues to assess that Putin is a risk-averse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through in order to break western resolve.” However, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. While the Belarusian army has not formally fought in Ukraine, Minsk and Moscow have a close military relationship. Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine last year and the two nations stepped up joint military training. On Sunday, Putin dismissed suggestions that Moscow was forging a military alliance with Beijing, claiming instead that western powers were building a new “axis” similar to the partnership between Germany, Italy and Japan during the second world war. “We are not creating any military alliance with China,” Putin said on state television. “Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret.” China and Russia signed a “no limits” partnership accord in early 2022, weeks before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Beijing has refrained from criticising Putin’s decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine. The Russian president named Australia, New Zealand and South Korea as being in line to join a “global Nato” and referenced a defence agreement signed by Britain and Japan earlier this year. “That is why western analysts … are talking about the west starting to build a new axis similar to the one created in the 1930s by the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy and militarist Japan,” Putin said. His words reflect his ongoing attempt to suggest that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that its western supporters are hellbent on menacing Russia. Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union and was subjected to devastation at the hands of Hitler’s forces, has consistently rejected those parallels as spurious pretexts for a war of imperial conquest.

It was an intricate story that played out over weeks of a televised courtroom drama that saw hundreds of journalists flock to a poor slice of rural South Carolina, turning the tiny town of Walterboro into a media circus. Here are some of the key moments: Murdaugh’s decision to testify against his defense team’s advice On the stand, Murdaugh admitted that he had been at the crime scene – a dog kennel on the family estate – on the night of the murders but maintained he had left before the killings took place to nap and to visit his mother. That countered his longstanding claims, made in taped interviews soon after the bodies of wife Maggie and son Paul were discovered, that he had not seen the pair for 90 minutes. He told that story on the night of the murders and again three days later. On the witness stand, he said that paranoid thinking brought on by an addiction to painkillers had caused him to lie to investigators. “I wasn’t thinking clearly,” he said. “I don’t think I was capable of reason, and I lied about being down there, and I’m so sorry that I did.” His own legal team had been against Murdaugh testifying but he insisted. Defense mistake that allowed prosecutors to bring in financial motive Another key point came when an apparent mistake by Murdaugh’s defense team allowed prosecutors to introduce evidence of the disbarred lawyer’s financial crimes that the state claimed motivated the murders by creating a distraction that would gain sympathy and time. The circuit court judge Clifton Newman said that the defense had “opened the door” to allowing Murdaugh’s financial situation brought into evidence after defense lawyers questioned witnesses on the stand about his character and if Murdaugh had any reason to kill his wife and son. Newman then said the jury was “entitled to consider whether the apparent desperation of Mr Murdaugh because of his dire financial situation and threat of being exposed … While motive is not a necessary element, the state must prove malice, and evidence of motive may be used to prove it.” Murdaugh later admitted to stealing from his law firm and clients. “I hate the fact that I did it. I’m embarrassed by it. I’m embarrassed for my son,” he said under cross-examination. “I’m embarrassed for my family, and I don’t dispute that I did it.” The Snapchat video Another shocking moment came earlier when prosecutors introduced cellphone video Paul Murdaugh sent to a friend minutes before he was killed. It showed a chocolate Labrador retriever and three voices could be heard in the background. During his testimony, Murdaugh admitted one of the voices was his. “Mr Murdaugh, is that you on the kennel video at 8.44pm on June 7,” defense attorney Jim Griffin asked, “the night Maggie and Paul were murdered?” “It is,” Murdaugh said. The defendant misspeaks? It did not help Murdaugh’s defense case that when he was shown crime scene photos he told police investigators: “It was so bad, I did him so bad.” But at his trial, Murdaugh’s lawyers said he’d actually said: “They did him so bad.” The taped was played to the court at 1/3 speed but the exact phrase was indiscernible. “I still hear him say ‘I’,” Jeff Croft, an agent with the South Carolina law enforcement division, testified. No one else in the frame Perhaps most crucially for some observers, there were no other suspects in the case. The defense’s two-shooter theory that rested on a gunman being less than 5ft 4in – according to their interpretation of the gunshot trajectories – was never fleshed out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T19:40:53Z","webTitle":"‘Strength and femininity’: Victoria Beckham power dresses in Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","fields":{"bodyText":"For Victoria Beckham, rising to the challenge of a Paris catwalk show began at ground level with the 6in platform heels she wore on the Eurostar journey from London. “I suppose I feel a bit more pressure because it’s Paris, but I embrace that,” she said before her show. “And it’s a good way to wear-test the shoes to see if they are comfortable.” Beckham is one of three names who flew the flag for British talent on a single day at Paris fashion week. At just 26, Harris Reed, who describes his style as “romanticism gone non binary”, made his debut on Friday as the new creative director at Nina Ricci. It came as the athlete Dina Asher-Smith joined Schitt’s Creek stars Catherine O’Hara and Dan Levy for an all-star front row at Loewe, which is designed by Jonathan Anderson. The star of Beckham’s front row was her 11-year-old daughter Harper, who had designed her own trousersuit for the occasion. (“She had a very clear vision,” noted her mother.) On the day of the show, Beckham’s label announced it had turned a profit in 2022 for the first time, with revenues rising 42% to £58m. Paris fashion week has been headlined by a return to power dressing, a vibe shift which Beckham reflected in “the biggest shoulders I’ve ever done. A jacket with a broad shoulder, and legs poking out, that’s what feels desirable to me now. That combination of strength and femininity.” Beckham put shoulder pads in her dresses for the first time; jeans had knife-sharp front creases stiffened with resin. A hit of humour cut through the glamour and polish as what appeared from a distance to be silk fringing turned out to be acrylic hair extensions. Reed chose a venue as French as they come for his Nina Ricci show – the former Air France headquarters in the shadow of Napoleon’s tomb – but opening with curve model Precious Lee in polka-dotted sheer taffeta was a mission statement about bringing more diverse and inclusive casting to Paris. The designer recently told Vogue that “Paris shows have always struggled a little bit because there’s a lot of white cisgender girls who are a bit underweight … looking at the French shows [and] I was like: ‘I don’t see femininity expressed in a way that feels curvaceous.’ And that’s deeply important to the inclusivity, to the femininity, that I want to bring to the helm of this brand.” He is introducing a broader-size run at the brand. The show was a stride into new territory for a house closely associated with the soft-focus, chiffon-draped adverts for its L’Air du Temps perfume. The house motif, a pair of doves, turned up here as metallic nipple pasties. Anderson put his catwalk in a 14th-century chateau as a form of show-and-tell. He “confronted history” at Loewe this season – after a decade of ignoring the house’s archives, his latest handbags are based on 1970s bestsellers – and wanted his audience to do the same. So he had them cross a wooden drawbridge and pass beneath a turreted arch to reach the catwalk. This was a high-concept event, from the stage set – Lara Favaretto’s art installation of 10,000kg of coloured confetti – to the peel-on, peel-off knitwear which will be available to purchase as stickers. Avant-fashion can feel chilly and antiseptic, but Anderson makes it sing by tuning into how clothes express thoughts and feelings. The unconscious defensive gestures of holding an elbow with the opposite hand to create a barrier with one arm, or of pulling sleeves down to conceal your hands, were baked into the way the fabric fell. A silk duchesse dress seemed to be suspended precariously from one gold clasp at the collarbone, bringing a mood of high-drama fitting that channelled the energy of a special night out. Anderson, backstage after the show, called it “emotional engineering”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T18:19:00Z","webTitle":"Fears for all Ukraine’s nuclear plants after emergency shutdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","fields":{"bodyText":"There are growing fears that Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of an unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said that all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday, but two generators were damaged in the process, delaying the restart of two reactors. Kotin said repeated shutdowns caused by more Russian missile attacks could cause extensive damage, with a potentially severe impact on Ukraine’s power supply and possibly on nuclear safety. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on a residential area in the city of Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, according to the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko. The Ministry of Defence in the UK said Russia had resorted to removing the nuclear warheads from cruise missiles and launching them with just ballast in their nosecones, with the aim of diverting Ukraine’s air defences and doing some damage just from the sheer force of their impact on targets. “Whatever Russia’s intent, this improvisation highlights the level of depletion in Russia’s stock of long-range missiles,” the ministry said in one of its daily assessments of the invasion. Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia could carry out another mass missile attack on infrastructure in the middle of this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, was seized by Russian forces in March and it has been off the grid since September, amid frequent shelling of the area around it. Ukraine’s three other nuclear power plants – Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi – have not been directly targeted in recent Russian missile strikes, but their safety could be threatened by further attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. Missile attacks last Wednesday on high voltage cables, transformers and substations triggered the first ever simultaneous emergency shutdown, or “scram”, of all four plants. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is becoming increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement. Kotin said: “In all the 40 years of operation of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, nothing like that has ever happened.” He emphasised that the plants were designed with multiple levels of protection against the kind of disastrous meltdown and explosion at Chornobyl in 1986. When the power grid failed under Wednesday’s attack, the reactors immediately scrammed to isolate themselves and diesel-powered generators started working to power the water circulation through cooling pools where spent fuel is kept. However, repeated attacks leading to more emergency shutdowns would impose enormous strain on all the components of the plants, from the core to the steam turbines to the generators, as result of rapid contraction and then expansion again when a plant is restarted. Kotin likened the process to driving a car at 200 km/h and then coming to an emergency stop. “You have all kinds of consequences, like your valves will warp – and there are a huge amount of valves between the reactor and the turbine,” he said. Ultimately, he added, the damage could have an impact on nuclear safety. Oleh Korikov, Ukraine’s chief inspector for nuclear safety, said each time there was an emergency shutdown, the risks multiplied. “Any use of the scram system may cause an accident,” Korikov told the Observer. “With this shutting-down process, it increases the probability of some malfunction of equipment or some mistake by personnel.” The diesel generators can keep the cooling and other safety systems going, but they do not produce enough power to restart a power plant. After an entire electric power system has shut down, that process is called a “black start” and it gets progressively harder the longer the shutdown lasts. A complicating factor is that the shutdown of a nuclear reactor produces an isotope of xenon in the fuel rods that absorbs neutrons, slowing down fission and adding to the difficulty in booting it back up. The stopping and restarting all requires substantial skill on the part of the plants’ Ukrainian staff, and the pressure on them is considerable, particularly the workers at the Zaporizhzhia plant, who are operating under armed Russian surveillance. In early October, Moscow declared the plant was part of Russian territory and therefore was under the supervision of Rosatom, the Russian nuclear power company. Staff at the plant have been put under pressure to sign documents acknowledging they were working for a Rosatom subsidiary. “Some people signed it but not many,” Kotin told the Observer. “There was a huge push from the beginning but right now it has stopped. The occupiers just stopped all the rhetoric they used before, like ‘this is Russia for ever under Rosatom’.” Some observers see this change in attitude as a sign that the Russian occupiers of the plant may be intending to withdraw. Kotin added that a second signthey may making contingency plans to leave was systematic looting. “They are starting to steal everything they can see, and they have packed their bags to get out from there,” he said, while emphasising there was no clarity over the Russians’ intentions. A former Zaporizhzhia worker who has been in contact with current employees said they had seen no signs of Russian departure. On the contrary, they said, soldiers at the plant were making preparations for a long winter, moving their sleeping quarters to the canteen. Grossi has been trying for months to negotiate the creation of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear plant where shelling would be prohibited, but Ukraine is insisting that such a zone should be completely demilitarised. “It is illegal for heavy weaponry to be within a civilian nuclear object. They actually use it like a military base for the protection of their heavy weaponry, which they have put in the turbine halls of units [reactors] one and two,” Kotin said. “This is a completely awful situation for fire safety. If there is a fire emergency, then you can’t mitigate it, because you just cannot get access – because all the free space in the turbine halls is packed with all these vehicles.” He said it was unclear whether there were any explosive materials stored in the turbine halls. The militarisation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is adding to the constant pressure on the staff, who are faced with the task of keeping two of the reactors in “hot shutdown” mode – a delicate operation – to provide some power and heating to the plant and the next-door town of Enerhodar, where the workforce lives. “If you have armed people breathing down your neck in the control room, it’s just an incredibly dangerous situation,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “If you have the three other nuclear power plants without any off-site power, and you can’t restart them because the grid is down, it’s like three enormous ticking timebombs,” Budjeryn added. “All of this combined means we’re talking about the most dangerous moment for nuclear security so far.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Power of touch: how blind women are helping detect breast cancer in India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","fields":{"bodyText":"The most satisfying part of Ritika Maurya’s work is reassuring the anxious. “Women fear coming for breast examinations,” says Maurya. “What if a lump is found in my breast? Will that be the end of my life? These are some of the questions that haunt them all the time.” Maurya is, she says, “still learning to be good at this”. As a blind child, she had a sheltered upbringing with protective parents who rarely let her leave the house. Now aged 23, she is a trainee medical tactile examiner (MTE) at Enable India, a disability rights organisation in the southern city of Bengaluru – part of a project where visually impaired women are taught to use touch to detect breast lumps or changes that might mean a lurking cancer. Maurya chats with her clients about their day, offers them water and holds their hands. She loves her work. Devised by a German gynaecologist, Dr Frank Hoffmann, through his social enterprise Discovering Hands, the method was brought to India in 2017 and has also expanded to Colombia, Mexico, Austria and Switzerland. However, the programme has been paused in Colombia and Mexico since the pandemic. Visually impaired women use braille-marked documentation tapes to measure the breast centimetre by centimetre. Each examination lasts 30-40 minutes and findings are passed on to a doctor who decides on any further assessment. MTEs can detect “lumps as tiny as 6-8mm, as opposed to the larger, 10-20mm ones sighted physicians are able to find”, Hoffman says. His system was introduced in India by the NAB India Centre for Blind Women and Disability Studies (NABCBW) in Delhi, where a study this year of tactile examinations on 1,338 women found 78% of malignant cancers were detected and only 1% missed. An earlier study in 2019 comparing the diagnostic accuracy of doctors and visually impaired MTEs found “clinical breast exams by MTEs with impaired vision appear to have an accuracy level similar to that of examinations by physicians or a combination of both”. Training was expanded to Bengaluru in 2020 by Enable India. Its founder, Shanti Raghavan, says they want breast-cancer screening to be available in “every village” of India. Since 2017, 18 MTEs have been trained in Bengaluru and Delhi; six are now employed in cancer hospitals. The next eight trainees, of whom Maurya is one, are about to graduate and the next cohort will be chosen soon after. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. In India, it is the leading cause of death from cancer among women, but 60% of cases are diagnosed at stage three or four of the disease, resulting in a significant reduction in survival rates. MTEs are a useful tool in the fight to change that picture says Dr Poovamma CU, a surgical oncologist at Cytecare, a hospital in Bengaluru that employs two of the women. “Women are uncomfortable about doing breast self-examinations and often don’t realise there’s a lump in their breast until it has grown to 4cm or 5cm,” she says. “Routine breast cancer screenings by MTEs in urban and rural communities and workplaces, where mammograms and ultrasound machines cannot reach, can make a significant impact in India, where robust government-run screening programmes don’t exist,” she says. Maurya, who has no vision in one eye and can only see shapes from the other, says her impairment heightens her tactile abilities – and science supports her. A blind examiner also means women feel more comfortable undressing, she says. Moving 1,300km (830 miles) away last July to Bengaluru, where she shares a room with another trainee, was a huge step for Maurya, whose world in Indore had been restricted to her home and family: her parents did not let her leave the house alone. “They would say: ‘What if you bump into something and hurt yourself?’” she says. “I felt awkward and uncomfortable talking to anyone, thinking that I had no talent and skills.” There are estimated to be 15 million women in India with visual impairment but only 5% of them have a chance to earn a living, according to NAB. For Maurya, the programme struck her as a rare opportunity. “I wanted to prove myself and show others that I could survive in this world,” says Maurya, who convinced her parents to let her try it. At Enable India, Maurya was given a white cane and mobility training so she could start moving independently from the NGO to her accommodation. She learned human physiology and anatomy, using 3D models, and was awe-struck, realising how much she had missed out on. “I felt, ‘oh, I could have studied science in school as well’, if only if I was taught through the ‘touch and feel’ methodology,” Maurya says.

Malcolm Turnbull was quick to share his concerns about the $368bn Aukus submarine purchase announced this week after 18 months of planning, but the opposition to Aukus was led by that Labor war horse: Paul Keating. And spectators of politics were treated to the best and worst of Keating at the National Press Club on Wednesday. Keating was at his weakest when defending China, deflecting questions about its human rights record by arguing mistreatment of Uyghurs is disputed. Challenged on how he could claim China is no threat to Australia, Keating responded “because I’ve got a brain”, labelling the question “dumb” and focusing only on the remote possibility of a land invasion. Trade sanctions are “not a threat” and cyber-attacks were also brushed aside because Russia and the US do them too. Yet amid all the free character assessments dished out, it was Keating’s reading of the internal dynamics of Labor that were the most perceptive. Keating assessed that in September 2021, when Scott Morrison sought Labor support for Aukus and nuclear submarines, Penny Wong was determined to prevent a “khaki election” and run the “smallest small-target strategy” by agreeing with the Liberals. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Anthony Albanese actually got out ahead of this criticism, noting in February in our political editor Katharine Murphy’s politics podcast that he would have pursued the Aukus alliance anyway because defence officials would have supplied the same advice. Keating took aim at Albanese for saying elsewhere that he was “very proud” to have provided bipartisan support for Aukus within 24 hours. The only way you could make such a decision – with its huge cost and implications for international relations – is “if you have no perceptive ability to understand the weight of the decisions you’re being asked to make”, Keating said. “It’s what other people call incompetence.” The defence minister, Richard Marles, countered in conversation with my colleague Daniel Hurst that the party didn’t decide “from scratch”, he was already “deeply immersed” since 2016 in the strategic thinking about submarine capability. Still, Keating said that Albanese had “no mandate” to agree to Aukus, predicting that when Labor branch members cotton on “there will be a big reaction”. If you were making a Frankenstein monster to scare Labor’s leftwing membership base, Aukus has some pretty alarming nuts and bolts: ever-closer alignment with the US, high level nuclear waste to be stored in Australia and hundreds of billions of defence spending. But the announcement front-loaded the winners from the plan (jobs for South and Western Australia). The losers are back-loaded: a nuclear waste dump, whereabouts TBD; $3bn of mystery cuts elsewhere in defence TBA; and a barney over where to put the east coast base, which locals at Port Kembla oppose. Few so far seem genuinely spooked by it. The Maritime Union and shipbuilding unions, including the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, wanted conventional submarines. Doug Cameron, a former AMWU secretary and Labor left senator, and Peter Garrett, the former environment minister, both bagged Aukus. One hard-left former union official and Labor staffer revealed on social media that his local branch had passed a resolution (before the announcement, incidentally) calling for a withdrawal from Aukus and abandonment of nuclear submarines – but whether that catches on is unclear. For the parliamentary Labor party, it seems the imperative of continuing Albanese’s honeymoon run trumps everything. That position may come under strain as parliament marks the 20th anniversary of the Iraq war invasion, a military decision which Labor rejected from opposition – a big call Keating says they got right and the sort of thing that might inspire more opposition to integration with the US system. Labor MPs this week were remarkably united, locked in behind a policy that has been set for so long and well-briefed on the specifics of its price tag and why it is necessary. They say their phones haven’t blown up. Josh Burns, the member for Macnamara in inner south Melbourne, said people respected what was a “serious policy” and an “important decision” for the country. Graham Perrett, the member for Moreton in Brisbane, said “people are aware the world is very different, even from 2013. “We know there is a changed set of circumstances – not just in Ukraine … we know that our local patch is different.” Even the question of how to pay for Aukus didn’t spark a fight . That was partly because the cost over four years is purportedly budget neutral and partly because the kite-flying exercise on reforming stage three tax cuts was already tried last year by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. For now, it’s no official change. That left the crossbench, particularly Senator David Pocock and the Jacqui Lambie Network, as the only ones joining the dots between the $368bn-over-30-year spending on Aukus and the $250bn over 10 on the stage-three tax cuts. A dishonourable mention this week goes to Peter Dutton for his suggestion that bipartisan support for cuts to the national disability insurance scheme could pay for Aukus. All the opposition leader needed to tell the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson was the Coalition would support appropriate savings but not Labor tax hikes. Instead he singled out one vulnerable category of welfare recipient, doubling down the next day after the announcement rather than taking the opportunity to clean up. Albanese got the line right on 3AW on Thursday: Aukus should be considered separately to measures to pay for it, because revenue and taxes are not reserved for a particular purpose. All in all, the sell has started well for Albanese: so far the critics are few and familiar, and the federal party remains united behind an enormous undertaking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T10:37:14Z","webTitle":"Clinton optimistic about power sharing in Northern Ireland after DUP talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","fields":{"bodyText":"Bill Clinton has expressed optimism that there will be a breakthrough in Northern Ireland’s political deadlock and a restoration of power sharing. The former US president made the prediction on Tuesday after meeting Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which holds the key to resolving the crisis. “I left that meeting more optimistic than I entered it,” Clinton, 76, told the BBC. Rishi Sunak’s post-Brexit deal with the EU had brought a political solution “pretty close”, he said. “So I expect that, in the not too distant future, the barriers to bringing up the government again will be removed because everybody knows that economically, socially and politically, they would be worse off if they packed it in over the current level of disagreement.” The comments fuelled speculation Donaldson intends to end a DUP boycott that has paralysed the Stormont assembly and executive for more than a year. Clinton is in Belfast this week with his wife, Hillary, for a conference at Queen’s University to mark the Good Friday agreement’s 25th anniversary. He shared a platform on Monday with the former British and Irish prime ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, who exhorted the DUP to revive Stormont. Donaldson has shunned the conference, prompting criticism from some participants. One, who declined to be named, said it was “shocking” given that George Mitchell, a former US senator who chaired peace talks in the 1990s, had made the trip despite being treated for leukaemia. Mitchell is 89. Clinton, who helped pave the way for the Good Friday agreement, declined to elaborate on his talks with Donaldson. “I’m here as a friend of the peace process and a friend of hope,” he said. The DUP collapsed power-sharing to protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements with Great Britain, which it said damaged trade and Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. It welcomed aspects of Sunak’s Windsor framework, that amended the arrangements, but wants further changes. There is speculation Donaldson could move to restore devolution after local elections on 18 May. This would anger some hardline loyalists and unionists but be welcomed by most people in Northern Ireland as well as London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington. In a keynote speech to the conference on Tuesday, Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the DUP the Stormont impasse posed the “single biggest threat” to Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. He urged unionists to “put the union first, restore the devolved institutions and get on with the job of delivering for the people of Northern Ireland”. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s foreign minister, swelled the chorus in a speech that said the best way to honour those whose lives were lost or destroyed during the Troubles was to collectively rediscover the spirit that made the 1998 agreement possible. “The essential next step is for the politicians of Northern Ireland to assume their responsibilities, fill the roles and institutions created by the Good Friday agreement – all of them – and get to work to secure the futures of the young people of Northern Ireland, and the generations to follow,” Martin said. Clinton is due to return to Derry on Tuesday, the scene of a rapturous visit in 1995, to pay tribute to the late political leaders John Hume and David Trimble, who shared a Nobel peace prize for sealing the Good Friday agreement. All living former UK prime ministers have been invited to a gala dinner in Northern Ireland on Wednesday to mark the agreement’s anniversary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-17T04:09:59Z","webTitle":"Aukus nuclear submarine deal will be ‘too big to fail’, Richard Marles says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine deal with the US and the UK will rapidly become “too big to fail”, the deputy prime minister has said. Richard Marles made the comment in an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, pushing back at the idea the multidecade Aukus plan could be vulnerable to political changes in both the US and the UK. He also predicted that broader diplomatic efforts to stabilise the relationship between Australia and China would “continue largely unaffected by what has been announced during the course of this week”. As the minister for defence, Marles has been at the centre of the Aukus planning. He said he had felt the “gravity” and “responsibility” of this week’s announcement of sweeping, staged plans that involve Australian spending of up to $368bn by the mid-2050s. One point of contention has been the Australian promise to provide $3bn in funding over the next four years to subsidise the submarine production base in the other two countries, mostly the US, and what guarantees there were that the US would actually proceed with selling three to five Virginia-class submarines to Australia in the 2030s. Asked what contracts or agreements sat underneath the high-level political commitment announced in San Diego this week, Marles said the project was “a shared endeavour of the three countries”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “There is going to be a legal underpinning to this … and there is going to need to be a treaty-level document between our three countries, so there is a whole lot of legality which will be worked through,” Marles said. “But in so many ways this transcends that [given] the sheer size of the decision to share this capability with Australia. And having taken the step of doing that, which we’ve done, puts all three countries in a position where it’s too big for it to fail on the part of any of those countries.” Marles said all three countries were “deeply committed to each other’s success in this project” and that was what gave him “a sense of assurance that this is going to play out in the way that we want it to play out”. “This must work for the US, this must work for the UK, as much as it must work for Australia,” he said. Despite Beijing’s strong criticism of the Aukus deal this week – which has included labelling it a cold war-era pact that would be dangerous for the region – Marles said Australia’s push for a productive relationship with China would continue. “China invests, obviously, in its own defence capabilities; we are doing that in respect of ours,” he said. “In terms of the relationship between our two countries and the way in which we speak to each other and the way in which we engage, I really do think that the project of seeking to stabilise that will continue.” Marles also addressed questions about whether the submarines could become obsolete, given that an Australian National University report, Transparent Oceans?, found that scientific and technological advancements predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. “Just as there is a lot of effort going into illuminating the seas, there is a lot of effort going into creating more stealth around a submarine,” Marles said. “You could flip the question and say: how confident are we that the veil of the sea will be lifted by 2050 such that we don’t need a submarine capability? Well, that would be a negligently risky call to make on the part of any Australian government.” Marles said the fact many countries were investing heavily in submarines showed that they would be “really useful parts of military capability for decades to come”. “But precisely because there is an effort to illuminate the sea is why a submarine capability, based on a diesel-electric power system, is going to be through the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s a comparatively diminishing capability, because more of that will be able to be seen.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said this week that the best way for Australia to reassure the region about the submarine plan would be to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. It is Labor party policy to do so, but only “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support from other nations. The nuclear weapons states including the US have opposed the treaty, arguing it is out of step with the current security environment. Marles said Australia wanted “a world where there are no nuclear weapons”, and had sent observers to the first meeting in Vienna last year. “A meaningful contribution to the removal of nuclear weapons needs to involve the engagement of the countries which have the nuclear weapons,” he said. “We completely get the intent of it, and we agree with the intent of it … but what the treaty needs to seek to achieve is universality in terms of those countries signing up to it, so that’s the issue.” • Hear the full interview with Richard Marles on Guardian Australia’s politics podcast"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power. In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices. The IEA report showed that clean energy investment has accelerated well beyond spending on gas, coal and oil as governments become increasingly concerned about developing secure, homegrown energy sources. However, the IEA report warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine has also prompted increased investment in upstream oil and gas, which is expected to rise by 7% in 2023 in a return to 2019 levels. At the same time global coal demand reached an all-time high in 2022, in part owing to record high gas prices, which has spurred estimated coal investment for this year to nearly six times the levels that are aligned with global 2030 climate targets. Birol said the single most important barrier facing the expansion of renewable energy remains problems with projects being able to connect to electricity grids. “We are seeing a pipeline of projects in Europe, US and Asia and Africa where the grid is the main problem. If you cannot reduce permitting time we will not be able to see the rapid expansion of renewables,” he said. In the UK, developers of renewable energy projects have complained that they have been forced to wait for more than a decade to connect to the electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T14:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","fields":{"bodyText":"We should be wary of simple declarations about the increasingly rapid transformation of the electricity grid. The government has been given a sharp reminder of this after leaning too heavily on pre-election modelling that suggested its policies to boost renewable energy could lead to a $275 cut in bills by 2025. You never know when a Vladimir Putin-shaped villain might disrupt international fossil fuel markets, wreck your assumptions and leave you accused of breaking an election pledge. Peter Dutton doesn’t have this excuse. The most generous thing that can be said about his foray into the debate over electricity last week is that he might want to get a broader range of advice. Giving his budget reply speech, the opposition leader said the Coalition wanted more renewable energy, but it just wasn’t possible yet, and it was a mistake for the government to allow ageing and expensive fossil fuel power to be phased out now. More specifically: “The technology doesn’t yet exist at the scale that is needed to store renewable energy for electricity to be reliable at night, or during peak periods. That is just the scientific reality.” To put it mildly, this is not the consensus opinion of experts in the field. David Osmond, a Canberra-based engineer with the global energy developer Windlab, is among those with a markedly different, evidence-based take. For more than a year, he has been posting weekly results from a live simulation tracking what would happen in Australia’s main electricity grid if it relied primarily on renewable energy. Using a live stream of electricity data from Opennem, he adjusted inputs to see what would happen if there was enough wind and solar energy to supply 60% and 45% of demand respectively. He added enough short-term storage, likely to be in the form of batteries, to supply average demand for five hours. The results are encouraging. They suggest close to 100% of demand – 98.9% over a 61-week period – could be delivered by solar and wind backed by existing hydro power and the five hours of storage. Nearly 90% of demand was met directly by renewable energy and 10% had to pass through storage. Achieving it would require a major expansion of transmission, as proposed by Labor under its Rewiring the Nation policy. The 1.1% shortfall mostly came when it was less sunny in late autumn and winter. Other technology would be needed to fill that hole. Osmond believes for now that would probably be fast-starting gas-fired power plants that are already connected to the grid, don’t run most of the time and can be called on quickly. There was nothing to suggest new ones were needed. It means a small amount of fossil fuel generation remaining in the grid, but less gas would be burned than now and, crucially, no coal power would be required. In the longer term, the backup could possibly come from cleaner sources – probably pumped hydro, maybe hydrogen or biofuels. None of these necessarily make economic sense the way solar and wind do – it is hard to justify a plant that would hardly ever be used – but could be needed in the context of the grid. An alternative would be to over-build solar and wind so there was always enough capacity online. By Osmond’s admission, this is a simplified model that assumes, for example, that electricity transmission links between regions can be delivered efficiently. No one should assume that the transition will be straightforward. The point is the technology already exists, and is comparatively cheap. From there it is a matter of design, engineering and, importantly, cost management. The last bit necessary to ensure the lights stay on is likely to make up a disproportionate amount of the overall cost. But the evidence says a renewable energy-dominated system is comfortably the cheapest form of generation if done right. Plenty of other studies have reached similar conclusions. The big one is the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan, a roadmap for the optimal future grid that was released in June. It backed an accelerated build of available technology to reach 83% of renewable generation by 2030, 96% by 2040 and 98% by 2050 as the best, most likely option. Presented with this evidence, Dutton and the Coalition continue to opt for none of the above. They appear to have joined a small band, including many in the usual right-wing media echo chambers, convinced that the evidence presented is wrong. Dutton was mostly dismissive of batteries in his budget reply, and implied small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – a commercially unproven technology that has been repeatedly delayed and more expensive than promised – could be the answer that ensures cheap energy. No evidence has been presented to suggest SMRs are needed to meet demand in Australia, given the country’s wealth of renewable options. Never mind that no independent evidence has been offered to suggest it could compete on price. If SMRs prove economically viable and safe elsewhere there is nothing to stop Australia considering their use, perhaps at remote off-grid industrial sites. It will be a good thing if they are viable, given not every country has ample alternatives to fossil fuels. But they are not designed to do the job needed here – to turn on occasionally and fill gaps in a system running on cheaper, renewable energy. Rather than an endlessly reheated debate about nuclear – the Coalition is holding another review, so expect plenty more of this – Australians would be better served if its politicians had a close look at a major report last week by the International Energy Agency. For the first time, the IEA forecast that fossil fuel use across the globe would peak in the next few years as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated a shift to clean fuels. It found existing policies would soon lead to coal use falling and demand for gas would plateau by the end of the decade. The declines will be much faster if, as expected, climate action continues to ramp up. Australia has one of the world’s largest fossil fuel export industries. It is supporting massive developments expected to last until late into the century as though nothing much is going to change. The significant climate impact of these developments is still routinely overlooked by the major parties on the grounds the gas and coal are burned overseas, and therefore somehow not Australia’s problem. But what about the economic and social impact of their potentially rapid decline? Now there’s an issue truly worthy of more parliamentary debate and action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T15:24:17Z","webTitle":"Chancellor extends energy windfall tax to ‘low carbon’ generators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","fields":{"bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt hopes to raise £14bn next year after increasing the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and reining in the profits of low carbon electricity generators. The chancellor also confirmed that the existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators, the energy profits levy (EPL), will be raised from 25% to 35% and extended by two years, until March 2028. From 1 January, a tax will also apply to “low carbon electricity generators”, including wind, solar and nuclear, levied at 45%. This is higher than the 40% rate trailed before the budget. Hunt said he expected the two taxes to raise £14bn next year. Treasury officials will meet energy bosses on Friday to discuss the proposals. Shares in the power station owners Centrica, Drax and SSE initially fell sharply moments after Hunt’s announcement, but later rallied as it emerged that the energy generator levy would be less onerous than feared. Oil and gas stocks were broadly unmoved. The chancellor said that most countries were still paying for the consequences of the pandemic and that this had been worsened “by a made-in-Russia energy crisis”. He had “no objection to windfall taxes if they are genuinely about windfall profits caused by unexpected increases in energy prices. But any such tax should be temporary, not deter investment and recognise the cyclical nature of energy businesses”. The surge in gas prices, in part fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has handed a surprise lift in profits to oil and gas companies, and generators including nuclear and biomass power stations and windfarms. The changes mean the EPL will raise a further £20bn over the next six years, to £40bn in total. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that oil and gas tax receipts, including the energy profits levy, will reach £14.9bn this financial year, double its March forecast. It said estimates for 2023-24 had quadrupled, to £20.7bn including £10.8bn. “The latter would be an all-time high for oil and gas revenues in cash terms, and the highest as a share of GDP since 1985-86,” it said, adding that volatility in energy prices meant these revenues are “particularly uncertain”. However, the energy profits levy has been criticised as it does not extend to the excess cash generated by oil and gas giants’ trading, refining and forecourts divisions. Hunt did not alter the levy to reach these windfalls. Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, said: “This so called windfall tax and budget doesn’t go anywhere near what’s needed to protect UK citizens that are being dragged into poverty, and barely touches the sides of the immense profits that energy companies have been amassing.” The OBR said onshore corporation tax, including the electricity generator levy, should raise £9.9bn next year. The levy is forecast to raise £14.4bn from 2022 to 2028. The generator levy was not as onerous as companies and investors had feared. The tax will be levied on “extraordinary profits”, made on electricity sold above £75 per megawatt hour. Power currently trades around £260 per MWh. Energy consultancy Aurora said future UK power prices are trading around £350/MWh and are forecast to remain above £225/MWh, making the levy more generous than the EU’s €180/MWh revenue cap. The government resisted calls to levy the tax on gas-fired power plants, which have also seen a rise in profits, arguing they were seeing higher costs and were exposed to “unique market risks”. Hydroelectric and battery storage facilities, oil and coal power stations were also omitted. The move to restrict profits on electricity generators represents a departure from the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to cap the revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, which would have been in line with the EU’s “revenue cap”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T11:17:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine faces ‘winter humanitarian crisis’ with energy grid on the brink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine faces a winter humanitarian crisis unless it can prevent a collapse in its electricity supply caused by the relentless campaign of Russian bombing, the chief executive of the country’s national grid has said. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive of Ukrenergo, said “virtually all” large non-nuclear power stations in the country had been hit, as well as more than 30% of the network’s routing substations. Describing the position as critical, the energy boss said Ukraine had asked western countries for badly needed spare parts last week – and repeated calls for more missile defence systems to help prevent damaging attacks. “This is the biggest missile attack on electricity infrastructure in history. Therefore, the impact is huge. Unfortunately the situation is critical. They are trying to specifically destroy the Ukrainian power system, and this supplies tens of millions of the population,” he said. If the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”, Kudrytskyi warned, adding that despite Ukrenergo’s efforts, it was not possible to repair the grid as fast as it was being destroyed. “It’s much easier obviously to launch missiles than to restore substations,” he said. The focus now is on keeping the lights on. “Before these missile attacks, the main goal was to supply as much energy as our customers need. However, now we’re speaking about the survival of the system,” Kudrytskyi told the Guardian during an air raid warning in Kyiv. Electricity was also necessary to sustain gas supplies, the chief executive said. “If the customers will spend too much time without electricity, and if heating systems have no connection to electricity, that will create big, social humanitarian problems.” He said Russia wanted to create “a humanitarian catastrophe” in Ukraine. Power cuts lasting several hours have become increasingly frequent in most areas of the country after a sustained Russian bombing campaign aimed at the electricity network that began last month. For now Ukrainians appear to be coping with the additional uncertainty and hardship without much complaint, accepting it as an unavoidable challenge they must overcome. Under the heading “No Power?”, a co-working space in Kyiv, Kooperativ Kyiv, has advertised that it has two electricity supplies and two internet suppliers so that people can work uninterrupted by the outages. “We’ll get through these times together,” read the advert. Ihor Sudakov, who lives next to a power station in east Kyiv that has been repeatedly hit, said he had attempted to prepare for further outages. “We’ve bought power banks – we keep at least three charged at a time,” he said. “We’ve also ordered this type of charging station that can charge a fridge and stove. Our building only has electricity so if the electricity goes we need to be able to cook.” As a double backup, he said, he had bought a propane camping stove. “I’m not worried that Russia will try to hit the [Kyjv] power station again – I know they will. It’s part of their terrorist tactics … so it’s about trying to be as autonomous as possible.” An attack involving 55 cruise missiles and five drones took place on Monday, aimed at the country’s hydro plants for the first time. Russian missiles targeted the electric infrastructure of the hydro plants, Kudrytskyi said, but not the dams themselves, which are considered more resilient. Although 44 of the missiles were said to have been intercepted by Ukraine, the damage caused on Monday was significant, the chief executive said. “It was in line with the scale of the attack, which was very big. This was a massive attack; massive damage [was] inflicted.” On Monday, 350,000 homes lost power in Kyiv and 80% of the water supply was disrupted after the attack, although both had been restored on Tuesday. Another 20,000 remained without supply in the Kyiv region, said the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba. In Kharkiv, where the main power station was damaged on Monday, Kharkiv hospital number 4 has been running on a reduced voltage – 180W instead of 220W – and there were concerns that this may damage the hospital equipment, said Oleksandr Dukhovsky, the head of paediatric surgery at the hospital. He said the hospital had fewer than five days’ worth of diesel to supply its backup generators. “We are not scared but we understand we need to be careful,” said Dukhovsky, adding that hospital staff were not losing faith and were willing to do what was necessary to win against Russia. Ukrainian officials do not release pictures of the damage to power plants and substations because they do not want Russia to precisely see what impact the attacks are having, but some facilities are acknowledged to have been destroyed. In Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is now less than 50% controlled by Russian forces and their proxies after recent Ukrainian advances, utilities have been intermittent or absent for months. Dmytro Myshenin of the NGO Vostok SOS, based in Kramatorsk, said that supplies had improved in a few towns but were still absent in places deemed too close to fighting, or very damaged. Towns such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk had had their water and gas supplies reconnected after the frontline was pushed back and people had returned, he said. But in areas closer to the frontline, people have now spent months living in dire conditions without running water and gas and some also without electricity. “There are many people surviving with portable wood-fired stoves and there aren’t enough of them,” said Myshenin. “We need more of everything.” A week ago, Ukraine sent out lists of replacement parts it needed to the US, UK, EU, and other western countries because “we need a lot of this equipment now”, Kudrytskyi said. He added that there was an urgent need for “western defence systems, which have proven to be very efficient against Russian missiles”. But the chief executive rejected claims that Ukraine could have better prepared. “We’re asking for defence systems all the time. I mean, this is not something new,” he said. “It’s not about our military needs. It’s about humanitarian catastrophe that has to be prevented for tens of millions of people in Europe.” Kudrytskyi said it would be possible for Ukraine – which used to be energy self-sufficient before the Russian attacks – to purchase electricity from Europe. But this would only be a partial help because of the damage to the country’s grid, which would make it harder to route electricity across the country, he said. “We can buy some energy from the EU because the Ukrainian power system is connected to the European power grid,” Kudrytskyi said. “However, we might be unable to deliver this important energy to certain regions, if the grid is damaged.” He also warned there was a danger of transmission bottlenecks. Large cities were at particular risk, he said, because of their huge energy demand. Among these, he listed the country’s main urban centres of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"New US rules could stem emissions from coal and gas power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","fields":{"bodyText":"The US is set to impose new carbon pollution standards upon its coal- and gas-fired power plants, in a move that the Biden administration has hailed as a major step in confronting the climate crisis. Under new rules put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), new and existing power plants will have to meet a range of new standards to cut their emissions of planet-heating gases. This, the EPA predicts, will spur facilities to switch to cleaner energy such as wind and solar, install rarely used carbon capture technology or shut down entirely. In all, the EPA forecasts that the standards would prevent up to 617m tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted from coal and gas plants over the next two decades, which is equivalent to the yearly emissions of around half of all the cars in the US, or nearly double what the entire UK emits in a year. The new rule – if it survives a gamut of expected legal challenges – will help “safeguard the planet for future generations”, according to Michael Regan, the EPA administrator. “Not only will the proposal improve air quality nationwide, it will bring substantial health improvements to communities across this country, especially communities that have unjustly borne the burden of pollution,” Regan said. “The public and environmental benefits of this rule will be tremendous.” The new rule has been welcomed by environmental groups as a potentially pivotal moment that should, in combination with support for clean energy in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, drive down emissions in the power sector, which contributes about a quarter of the US’s overall greenhouse gas pollution. Researchers have warned that without further regulation of major pollution sources, the US – the world’s largest historical emitter of planet-heating gases – will miss its climate targets and risk unleashing ever worsening heatwaves, droughts, flooding and societal upheaval at home and overseas. “The EPA’s proposed rule sends an unequivocal signal to American power plant operators: the era of unlimited carbon pollution is over,” said Dan Lashof, US director of the World Resources Institute, who added that the regulation would result in more than an 80% reduction in carbon pollution from power plants by 2040 compared to 2005 levels. “This is a day for the history books, as the United States locks into the path toward a prosperous, clean and equitable future.,” Lashof said. The climate rule caps off a month of frenzied activity by the EPA, which has issued a flurry of new regulations aimed at curbing air toxins from industrial facilities and restricting planet-heating gases from new cars and trucks. In combination, these moves “have the potential to substantially advance clean power generation in the US”, according to Brian Murray, an environmental policy expert at Duke University. This is despite a series of controversial recent decisions by the Biden administration that risk undermining its own climate agenda, such as the approval of the Willow oil project in Alaska and the buildout of a growing export industry for liquified natural gas. Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen, an environmental campaign group, said younger voters in particular want the Biden administration “to make polluters clean up their act; in fact they want him to go further, faster. Vehicles and power plants are the two most polluting sectors in the US and the sticks that the EPA can wield here are essential.” The agency’s push to tackle the climate crisis still faces significant hurdles. The rightwing-dominated supreme court, which limited the scope of the EPA’s climate actions in a ruling last summer, may well intervene again after the almost inevitable lawsuits that coal-rich Republican states will probably launch. The supreme court previously stymied a previous, albeit more sweeping, attempt to regulate power plants by Barack Obama’s administration. EPA officials have said, however, they are confident the rule sits within the court’s view of the agency’s authority. “We feel really good that we are within those bounds,” Regan said. Meanwhile, a future Republican president, perhaps even Donald Trump, could undo the pollution regulations. The new climate rule already has a committed congressional foe in the form of Senator Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat who personally has coal interests in his native West Virginia. “This administration is determined to advance its radical climate agenda and has made it clear they are hellbent on doing everything in their power to regulate coal- and gas-fueled power plants out of existence,” said Manchin, who vowed, as chairman of the Senate’s energy and natural resources committee, to block all EPA nominees in protest over the rule. This rhetoric was echoed by the National Mining Association, which claimed that the EPA’s “disregard for the repercussions of premature coal plant retirements” posed serious risks. Several analyses have shown, however, that coal is being displaced in the US largely by economic forces, such as cheaper gas, rather than environmental regulation. The toll of fossil fuels remains immense, too – as well as spurring the climate crisis, the burning of fossil fuels is estimated to kill around 9 million people worldwide each year through air pollution. The EPA predicts the new climate rule will have $85bn in climate and public health benefits by 2042, preventing about 1,300 premature deaths and 300,000 severe asthma attacks in 2030 alone by reducing harmful air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The new climate rule will go through a period of public comment before a final version is implemented by the EPA, prior to next year’s presidential election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra review: creative power behind stunning screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","fields":{"bodyText":"The top of Samsung’s new 2023 laptop line is the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra: a powerhouse 16in machine aiming squarely at Apple’s 16in MacBook Pro for creatives and gamers. A laptop called Ultra obviously doesn’t come cheap, costing from £2,449 ($2,200), which is about the same price as Windows 11 rivals from Dell and Razer but slightly cheaper than Apple’s top machines. The Ultra looks very similar to Samsung’s other minimalist Galaxy Book laptops from the last few years, only bigger, in contrast to frequently garish gaming PCs. It is surprisingly thin and light for a 16in laptop, weighing 1.78kg, which isn’t dramatically heavier than much smaller machines and much lighter than most of the competition. The star of the show is the simply stunning 16in 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It is one of the best displays I’ve seen, with inky blacks, amazing contrast and accurate colours that practically burst out of the screen. Its peak brightness of about 500nits for HDR content is comfortably beaten by the searing brightness of the LCD-based MacBook Pro but in line with OLED competitors and certainly bright enough to look great. Below the screen is a big and good keyboard, with a solid typing experience and a fingerprint reader in the power button. Gamers may want more feedback but for writing it was excellent. It has a decent but not class-leading 1080p webcam with various tricks such as auto-panning and blur effects at the top of the screen. The mics are very good, and the set of four speakers is pretty immersive for a laptop. Specifications Screen: 16in 3K AMOLED 2880 x 1800 (120Hz; 201 PPI) Processor: Intel Core i7-13700H or i9-13900H (13th gen) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX4050 (6GB) or 4070 (8GB) laptop GPU RAM: 16 or 32GB Storage: 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 1080P Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1, USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4, headphones, microSD, HDMI2.0 Dimensions: 355.4 x 250.4 x 16.5mm Weight: 1.79kg Two-stage power The Ultra is available in a small choice of configurations that vary by country, including models with an Intel Core i7-13700H processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX4050 graphics card, or a Core i9-13900H and RTX4070 at the top end as tested. Note, a model with 32GB of RAM or greater is not available in the UK, which may be a deal killer for some. As you would expect for the hardware, the Ultra is an extremely powerful machine, keeping pace with Apple’s top laptop and gaming rigs across a range of tests. It is able to produce high frame rates in a variety of demanding games at 1080p resolution with high graphics settings, which look fantastic on the glorious screen. The base of the laptop gets pretty hot, however, so I would not use it gaming on a lap. It also handles complex image and video editing, transcoding and other demanding tasks with aplomb for creative applications. But its maximum power is only available when it is plugged in and set to high performance mode. That’s typical of the kind of PC hardware it has inside but isn’t the case for Apple’s competitor. Even at full tilt, the fans in the Ultra manage to avoid being overly noisy compared with some hairdryer-like laptops. In more mundane day-to-day productivity work, it runs essentially silently, which is most appreciated. Battery life for productivity is fairly average, lasting about seven hours on a balanced workload of browsing, video calls and writing, which isn’t quite enough for a work day. It holds up better compared with the competition under intense loads, lasting just shy of three hours when pushed. A full charge takes about 75 minutes using the included 100W power adaptor. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The laptop is generally repairable priced on a case-by-case basis but not upgradeable. The laptop contains recycled plastic in its casing. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for some old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Windows 11 + Samsung The Ultra runs Windows 11 out of the box but comes pre-installed with a large range of Samsung apps and tools. Generally, it ran smoothly and without issue. I removed the free trial of McAfee and several other unwanted apps. You may never use many of the 22 included Samsung apps and can safely uninstall them. But some, such as the quick settings tool, are very useful, allowing you to change system settings, performance modes, screen modes and other bits quickly and painlessly. About half of them are designed to link up with and sync content across other Samsung devices, which is handy if you happen to also have a modern Galaxy phone or any of the company’s accessories such as earbuds. For example, you can control a Samsung phone using the keyboard and mouse on the laptop. Some of the other tools, such as the Intel connectivity performance suite, give you much greater control over the hardware within the laptop, which is welcome given this is a power-user machine. Price The Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra starts at £2,449 ($2199.99) with an Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU. The Core i9 version with GeForce RTX 4070 costs £3,049. For comparison, the equivalent Razer Blade 16 starts at £2,699, the Dell XPS 15 at £3,099, the Alienware m16 at £2,149, and the Apple 16in MacBook Pro at £2,699. Verdict The Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is the first Samsung laptop to really compete on a level with arch-rival Apple’s big MacBook Pro, delivering the raw power, quality build and stunning screen required by creatives and gamers alike. It is a thoroughly impressive machine, offering the ability to seamlessly switch between simple productivity work, serious photo and video editing, and then perform as a proper gaming rig at the end of the day, all without looking out of place. There are few machines that manage that quite so successfully, and in such a light and compact body for a 16in laptop. The enormous trackpad is great, and the keyboard is really good for writing, but gamers might want a bit more feedback. It is very expensive, even if competitively priced for this type of machine. It could do with longer productivity battery life. For those looking for a Windows alternative to a 16in MacBook Pro for creative work or a more subtle gaming PC they can lug to the office when needed, the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is right up there with the best available. Pros: stunning 16in OLED screen, powerful choice of top Intel and Nvidia chips, enormous trackpad, good keyboard for writing, subtle design, good speakers and mics, decent webcam, compact and light for a workstation. Cons: expensive, no 32GB RAM option in the UK, only HDMI2.0, max performance only available when plugged in, productivity battery life is a bit short, design might be too businesslike for a gaming laptop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:51:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Russia moved ahead on Thursday with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has begun withdrawing its forces from the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and transferring its positions there to regular Russian troops, according to its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it described as the “complete lack of results” in an investigation to identify who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. Ukraine said on Thursday it had shot down all 36 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks which it claims likely targeted key infrastructure and military facilities. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations can reveal. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter. An entry in the Dutch land registry shows that the plot of land was seized on 12 May by the national public prosecutor’s office for financial, economic and environmental offences. The agency is responsible for enforcing sanctions compliance. Dutch cadastre documents show that the land plot was seized as part of a criminal investigation. You can read more of this exclusive, by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, here: America has long asked Ukraine not to use US-provided military equipment to carry out attacks inside Russian territory, Gen Mark Milley, the top US general, said on Thursday. Milley, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said his office was looking into imagery appearing to show vehicles allegedly used in an attack around the Russian border region of Belgorod. But he said the US position against such US equipment being used inside Russia was clear to Kyiv, Reuters reports. During talks held this week in Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence minister personally thanked Ben Wallace for the UK’s continued military support for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence has said. The UK defence secretary met his counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, after the UK provided Ukraine with long-range precision strike capability earlier this month. British sources have said giving Storm Shadow missiles was compatible with the UK’s signature to the voluntary missile technology control regime, which is intended to limit the proliferation of cruise missiles. Wallace said in comments released on Thursday: I was pleased to visit Kyiv again to meet with my good friend Oleksii Reznikov to discuss the next stages of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion. The UK continues to offer equipment, training and advice to Ukraine’s armed forces. I also visited some of the military commanders who have been so bravely pushing back Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two US strategic bomber planes away from the Russian border as they flew over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. “The crew of the Russian fighter aircraft identified the aerial targets as two US air force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said in a statement. The US aircraft did not cross the border and the fighter jets returned to their home airfield, it added. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Ukraine said on Thursday that it would open more embassies in Africa, as it announced its intention to stage a historic summit with leaders from the continent. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, made the comments in a statement to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). He said: We have recently adopted our first African strategy and intensified our political dialogue with many countries on the continent. This year, we are going to establish new embassies in different parts of the continent and plan to hold the first Ukraine-Africa Summit. I invite the leaders of your countries to take part in this important event. In a lower section, the address read: “We are hearing calls for peace from various countries and leaders. We support them as such and think they need to be directed first and foremost to Russia as the country that started this war.” Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, confirmed on Thursday that the relocation of some tactical nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russia signed a deal with its close ally Belarus earlier on Thursday about the storage of the warheads at a special facility that should be finished in just over a month’s time. It is unclear at this stage how many nuclear weapons would be kept in Belarus. Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, and have a relatively short range. Speaking in Moscow, Lukashenko said “the movement of the nuclear weapons has begun,” AP reports, but he was not clear whether any actually had arrived in his country. Lukashenko, who sparked rumours of being seriously ill when he cut short a Victory Day appearance in Red Square on 9 May before resurfacing in public on 15 May, was attending a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council with Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plan for the nuclear deployment, Moscow’s first outside Russia’s borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, was announced by Putin in an interview with state television on 25 March. The Russian president has said the west is fighting an escalating proxy war against Russia. The US government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds, AP reports. The Danish foreign ministry has confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned by Russia over the Nord Stream investigation (See 12:34), and said authorities in Denmark, Germany and Sweden were continuing their investigations, Reuters reports. “Denmark has been providing ongoing updates to Russia regarding the investigation’s progress and responding to their inquiries. We will continue to do so,” the ministry said in an email. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner has claimed his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and handing over control to the Russian military. Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts, Hanna Maliar, the deputy minister of defence, said. Russia and Belarus signed a deal formalising the procedure for deploying Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, AP reported. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after reports claimed that emergency services had been called to the building. Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said on Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. The European Commission has repeated calls for China to play a constructive role in establishing peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. “The EU expects China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role (...) and to recall the necessity to respect the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity (...) by unconditionally withdrawing all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the EU said in a statement on Thursday. Last week, Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement. He is set to visit Russia on Friday. Finland will provide Ukraine with additional military aid worth around €109m, with the package containing ammunition and anti-aircraft weapons, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, has been quoted by the Kyiv Post as saying. Finland is also among the European countries helping Ukraine defend itself on the battlefield, sending Leopard tanks to assist in combat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, for the military package, which he says is “urgently needed on the battlefield”. Zelenskiy tweeted: I thank Finland and President @niinisto personally for the prompt implementation of our agreements reached in Helsinki. The 16th package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which will include anti-aircraft systems and ammunition, is urgently needed on the battlefield. Together to victory! Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and adviser to Ukraine’s interior minitry, has shared an unverified clip that purports to show a drone attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs yesterday. Russia claimed on Wednesday it had repelled three unmanned vessels that attempted to strike the reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea, but the video appears to show that at least one of the drones got extremely close to the ship, even though it remains unclear if any damage was caused. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence issued this statement: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km north-east of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfil its tasks. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament has offered words of reconciliation over second world war-era mass murders that have strained relations with its neighbour and strategic ally Poland for 80 years. Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers that the two countries should work together to identify and honour Polish victims buried in Ukraine, sounding a new tone in contrast to the recent angry reaction of Ukraine’s ambassador to Polish expectations of an apology. About 100,000 Poles were massacred in 1943-44 by Ukrainian nationalists and others in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine. “Human life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,” Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers. “With this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.” Poland this year is marking the 80th anniversary of the 1943-44 massacre. Entire villages were burned down and all their inhabitants killed by the nationalists. Poland calls the events a genocide. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians died in retaliation. Associated Press reports Stefanchuk thanked the families of the victims for cultivating a memory that “does not call for revenge or hatred, but which serves as a warning that nothing like that can ever happen between our nations again”. He said identification and honoring of the victims “without bans or barriers” is “our joint moral and Christian obligation.” Poland’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Łukasz Jasina, had last week said that on the 80th anniversary Poland was expecting an apology from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Zvarych, reacted by saying that any suggestions of what Kyiv or Zelenskiy should do were “unacceptable and unfortunate”. Here are some of the latest pictures from Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner, claimed on Thursday that his forces had started pulling out of the city. Ukraine, which denies that Bakhmut has fallen to Russia, insisted it still controlled a “micro district” of the devastated city and said it was still advancing on the flanks, AFP reports. There has been an update on the reports of the alleged detention of two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia (See 06:56am): The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the saboteurs working for Ukrainian foreign intelligence had laid explosives on 11 pylons of the Leningrad and Kalinin nuclear power stations. “The plan of the Ukrainian special services was to prompt the shutdown of the nuclear reactors, disrupt the operation of the nuclear power plants and cause serious economic and reputation damage to the Russian Federation,” the FSB said in a statement. The attacks were due to take place on the eve of the 9 May anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, added the FSB, which said the saboteurs had been recruited in 2022 by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. These claims could not be independently verified. The Leningrad station, located on the Gulf of Finland close to St Petersburg, is Russia’s biggest atomic power plant. The Kalinin nuclear power station is 350km north of Moscow. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that Russia says it has captured, but where Kyiv’s forces claim they still have a small foothold, Reuters reports. “Every one of them is a hero of our state. Many of the ones we are returning from captivity were considered missing. The relatives of these people have gone through a difficult time,” said Andriy Yermak, the senior official. There was no immediate information available about the forces Russia received from Ukraine in exchange. Here is some more reporting on the exchange from The Kyiv Independent: Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year. In a statement, the ministry accused all three countries of trying to conceal who was behind the blasts, adding that it was unhappy about what it called the opaque nature of the investigation and its refusal to engage with Russia. According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives. The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries have said the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible. The two countries and Germany have been investigating the incident. Japan scrambled jet fighters after spotting Russian military planes over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan on Thursday, the defence ministry said. It detected one Russian information-gathering aircraft IL-20 flying round-trip from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific and another IL-20 flying toward the waters near Sado Island before turning toward the continent, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The EU agreed on Thursday to suspend restrictions on imports from Ukraine for a further year after warding off an import ban on grain imposed by some EU nations, Reuters reports. The Council of the EU, the grouping of EU governments, said in a tweet that EU ministers responsible for trade had agreed to the extension at a meeting on Thursday. The EU lifted tariffs and other restrictions for an initial 12 months in June 2022. In reaction to the news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for the “temporary liberalisation” to become permanent, as he continues to seek EU accession for Ukraine. He tweeted: As we move towards the EU, this temporary liberalization should become permanent – without any exceptions or restrictions. I am grateful to all EU members for their support, which brings us closer to the EU accession. Last month, EU governments agreed to extend the suspension of duties and quotas on imports from Ukraine by a year to help its economy during the war with Russia. Ukraine gained EU candidacy status in 2022 at record speed, but while it was an initial step to membership, the process usually takes many years to complete. In addition to Russia announcing on Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country (See 09:46), Moscow has additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September, Reuters reports. We reported earlier (See 10:27) that Russia is said to have replaced Wagner private military units with regular troops in the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian mining city that has been largely devastated by a year of deadly fighting. Reuters has new quotes from Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, who had an update after reports of Wagner forces withdrawing from the eastern Ukrainian city and handing over their positions to regular Russian troops. Maliar wrote in comments on the Telegram app: “In Bakhmut’s outskirts, the enemy has replaced Wagner units with regular army forces. Inside the city itself Wagner fighters remain.” She also said that Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts of the city. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, claimed that the number of Russian attacks in the area had fallen in the last three days, and that there had been two military engagements in the last 24 hours, though shelling continued. You can read more on the fighting raging in Bakhmut here: Unverified footage of drones being shot down over Kyiv last night has been posted by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. He tweeted: Another sleepless night for many of us. Another attack on Kyiv. We hold on, go to work in the morning, thankful to our air defense and all our friends who keep Ukraine in their hearts and bring our Victory closer. Russia unleashed a barrage of drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, but the city’s air defences shot all of them down, Ukrainian authorities claimed on Thursday. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. Yesterday he warned of a new revolution in Russia if leaders did not improve their handling of the war. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counter-offensive coming from Ukraine that would be marked by a single significant shift of gear. He wrote: “Once again about the counter-offensive. This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down 36 out of 36 Shahad drones launched into Ukraine by Russia overnight. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that some areas of Chernivtsi were left without power after lines were damaged by falling drone debris. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine” as the two countries signed an agreement on the positioning of nuclear weapons in Belarus. During a visit to Minsk Sergei Shoigu said “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Russia had always held Kyiv responsible, and that it didn’t really matter exactly which Ukrainian units were behind it. Podolyak on Thursday responded by saying Ukraine had nothing to do with the “strange and pointless” attack. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brink tweeted: “After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative.” Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Earlier today Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counteroffensive coming from Ukraine that would mark a significant shift of gear. He tweeted: Once again about the counteroffensive. Without further questions. 1. This is not a “single event” that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. 2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow. 3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive. However, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, notes: “Except, at some point, Ukrainian ground forces will need to attack with sufficient combat mass …” Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Yesterday, Julian Borger reported for the Guardian from Kyiv that Progozhin had said that 20,000 of its fighters have been killed in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. He also warned that Russia could face another revolution if its leadership does not improve its handling of the war. Prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war, with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said in an interview posted on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. “First the soldiers will stand up, and after that – their loved ones will rise up. There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.” Reuters reports Russian prosecutors have asked a court to recognise crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the Moscow region during the second world war as a genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union. Russia said on Thursday it would expel five Swedish diplomats in what it said was a retaliatory measure for Sweden’s “confrontational course” in relations with Russia. The Russian foreign ministry said it was responding to the expulsion of five of its diplomatic staff from Sweden last month, which it called an “openly hostile step”. Relations between the two countries have worsened since Sweden last year announced its intention to join Nato after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports the Russian statement said ties had “reached an unprecedented low”. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide said on Thursday that Ukraine had nothing to do with a “strange and pointless” drone attack on the Kremlin and played down the findings of two US media reports. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, told Reuters in a statement that Russia was trying to reduce arms supplies to Kyiv by playing on western fears of a possible escalation because of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed that a drone attack on the Kremlin this month was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brinktweeted: After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine”. Russia launched part of its full-scale invasion and failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian soil in February 2022, in what it termed a “special military operation”. In statements published on Telegram by Russia’s ministry of defence, Sergei Shoigu is quoted as saying his meetings with his Belarusian counterpart have become more regular, saying: This is especially important in the context of the rapid growth of tension, the destruction of the foundations of strategic stability and the unprecedented intensification of international confrontation. Everything possible is being done to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine, which is receiving all kinds of military support. The Republic of Belarus has been and remains our faithful ally and reliable partner. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson has said of reports in the New York Times that Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin that “it doesn’t make much difference which of the units of the Kyiv regime is behind it”. Reuters reports Dmitry Peskov told the media: “We immediately said that the Kyiv regime was behind this.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denied at the time that Ukraine was responsible. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Tass has more detail on the document signed today concerning arrangements for Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons. On Telegram it quotes Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu saying “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. It also reports Shoigu noted the measures implemented by Russia and Belarus “comply with all existing international legal obligations”. Tass writes: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 25 March that Russia, at the request of the Belarusian side, would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, as the US has long done on the territory of its allies. According to the head of the Russian state, on 1 July it is planned to complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the Iskander missile system, which can be a carrier of nuclear weapons, and has assisted in re-equipping Belarusian aircraft to be able to use special ammunition. Belarusian servicemen have undergone appropriate training in the Russian Federation. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has started withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video published on Thursday, Reuters reports. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. The defence ministers of Russia and Belarus on Thursday signed a document on the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. Separately, citing Russian media, Reuters reported that the Russia defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the west was waging an “undeclared war” against Russia and Belarus. Shoigu is in Minsk for a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the CSTO member states, which include Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia and Belarus, which are close allies over the conflict in Ukraine, agreed earlier this year to deploy part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal in Belarus. Russia launched its failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian territory last year. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on the overnight situation, writing on its official Telegram channel: At night, air defence forces destroyed 36 of the 36 ‘Shahed’ drones that Russia launched over Ukraine, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian military struck Tsyrkuny in the Kharkiv region. The S-300 missile hit the ground. A private house was damaged, there were no injuries. In the Chernivtsi region, two power lines were damaged as a result of the fall of the drone debris – part of the Dnipro district was cut off. Three residential buildings were damaged. Yesterday, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 83 times: four people were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted to Telegram to state that in the last 24 hours one person has been killed and six injured by Russian shelling in the region. He listed a number of locations where houses and infrastructure had been destroyed, including Horlivka, Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties, Reuters reports Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. It writes: US officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration. US intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation. The New York Times goes on to say: US officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorised the Kremlin drone attack is “low” but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved. The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the US – Ukraine’s biggest supplier of military equipment – uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame US officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine. American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Zelenskiy, officials said. At the time, Zelenskiy said “We didn’t attack Putin or Moscow”, as he addressed journalists during a visit to Helsinki. Russia’s FSB security service says it has detained two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency RIA. More on that story now: Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment,said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. Investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: A second fire, which appeared to be unrelated, broke out at a market in Akos, in the Moscow region on Wednesday evening. Russia’s emergency services said on Telegram that the fire had increased from 500 sq metres to 1,800 sq metres and had been localised. No victims were reported. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, saying: “The fire broke out in the building of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in the centre of Moscow.” They cited an unnamed government source and said “a fire broke out on one of the balconies.” Emergency services were on the scene, the source told Tass. Almost an hour later, the news agency published a second story saying: “The Ministry of Emergency Situations did not detect a fire in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation for Moscow told reporters on Thursday.” Both stories were still up on the website at 5am Thursday, Moscow time. Unverified video circulated on social media early on Thursday showing smoke emerging from the ministry building. In one video of the building seen by CNN, a woman could be heard saying: “The smell of burning is horrible.” Denis Kapustin, Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used US military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, but declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately not from the Western partners”, he said. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, spoke to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled the raid on the Belgorod region. Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as homegrown, internal Russian strife. Two groups operating in Ukraine – the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion - have claimed responsibility. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who introduced himself by his call-sign White Rex. “I cannot reveal those upcoming things, I cannot even reveal the direction. The ... border is pretty long. Yet again there will be a spot where things will get hot.” Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. Via AFP: Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram that Russia “again attacked Kyiv from the air”. “The attack was massive,” the statement added. “The enemy continues to use attack tactics in several waves, with intervals between groups of attacking drones.” He added that “all detected air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv were destroyed” by Ukrainian air defence systems. The attacks were carried out using Iranian-made Shahed drones, the statement added, citing preliminary information. Air alerts were also reported in the cities of Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. And Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital. Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Here are the other key developments: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. In Belgorod, nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iranians on Wednesday to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia. Iranian-made Shahed drones supplied to Moscow have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The simple question is this: what is your interest in being an accomplice to Russian terror?” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “What is the benefit to Iran of such cynical killing?” Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” The Russian private army Wagner lost 20,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, and a similar number of its regular troop. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. The European Union has discussed sending Ukraine the profits from €196.6bn of Russian assets that are stuck inside the plumbing of global financial markets, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T15:00:29Z","webTitle":"Port Kembla rally to demand NSW site be ruled out as Aukus nuclear submarine base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor members are set to join unionists at a rally in Wollongong’s Port Kembla on Saturday to urge the Albanese government to rule out the location as a future base for the Aukus nuclear-powered submarines. Rally organisers say the debate is “a proxy battle” for Australia’s future and warn the delay in making a decision will only deter renewable energy investment in Port Kembla. The former Morrison government named it as well as Newcastle and Brisbane as three potential sites for a new east coast base, with reports earlier this year suggesting Port Kembla was favoured by defence planners. But in the wake of the defence strategic review, the Labor government has delayed a decision on the location and has signalled it will not limit itself to the Morrison government-era shortlist. It also now talks about a “facility”, not necessarily a base. A spokesperson for the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the government would “develop a process to consider all feasible options for an east coast facility to support Australia’s future submarine capability”. A decision would be made “late in this decade”, the spokesperson said. The government believes it can take the time to weigh up the decision, with the more immediate priority being infrastructure works at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, which will host rotational visits by US and UK submarines from 2027. But the rethink has failed to ease concerns of opponents of a new base in Port Kembla. Those opponents say they expect more than 1,000 people to march on Saturday. The South Coast Labour Council’s annual May Day march has been moved from Wollongong to Port Kembla to shine a spotlight on opposition to the proposed base. Arthur Rorris, the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council and a member of the Labor party, said the rally was attended last year by more than 750 people, but it would be “bigger this year than normal”. “That is a reflection of the concern in the community about the proposed east coast nuclear submarine base.” He expected “a very strong showing of Labor party membership”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Rorris said locals had “grave fears” that the prospect of a submarine base would crowd out potential energy investors. “That is why we are asking the federal government: rule it out, take it off the table and say that it will never be a nuclear base. Until that happens, economically and industrially, we have a major and unacceptable problem.” Rorris said the traditional coalmining and steelmaking region had been seen as “carbon central”, but a lot of work had been done to keep people together on the journey to a renewable energy future. “Many people are very, very pissed off, to be honest with you. We’re at the point where we’re able to get the fruits of all that work, now they want to turn this place into ground zero.” Rorris said it was a “choice between the industries of the future to save the planet versus the war machines that may well destroy it”. “We understand that unlike the Morrison government, this Albanese federal government is a bit more attuned to the feeling on this matter on the ground,” Rorris said. “I think they understand the alarm and I suspect that what is happening is that the defence department, which has a habit of getting its way on these things, hasn’t been able to convince the government as yet – as yet – to make a call on it. “We make no apologies for putting as much pressure as possible on the decision makers to rule out Port Kembla now, not later.” Some Labor party members plan to march as part of a newly formed anti-Aukus network, named Labor Against War. Marcus Strom, a spokesperson for Labor Against War and a former Albanese government press secretary, said the party had “a proud tradition of opposing the nuclear industry and wars of aggression”. “We are very worried about the direction the government is taking with Aukus, a Scott Morrison thought bubble agreed to by federal caucus without any debate in the party,” he said. “Australians do not want to be dragged into another US-led war.” To date the federal Labor caucus is largely united behind the Aukus agreement, even though some MPs have asked questions. But rank-and-file members who hold concerns are understood to have been emboldened to become more active after several prominent Labor figures including the former prime minister Paul Keating spoke out against Aukus. The Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, who will address Saturday’s rally, said it was a “dishonest approach from the government to agree to an east cost submarine base and then refuse to tell anyone where it will be”. “There is no doubt that the civil revolt in the Illawarra has forced the government to, at least temporarily, step back from naming Port Kembla as the east coast nuclear submarine base,” he said. “The Albanese government knows the optics is dreadful of taking on an array of unions and an engaged local community who prize and protect the extraordinary anti-war history of the Illawarra, so they are putting the decision off as long as they can.” Shoebridge said the “inevitable exclusion zones” around a submarine base would “monopolise the port and strangle the exciting plans to make it a renewable energy services and export hub”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: Auriga hidden in plain sight beside its famous neighbours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","fields":{"bodyText":"This week, search out the northern constellation of Auriga, the charioteer.

The chart shows the view from London facing south, and looking high up in the sky, towards the zenith. In Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes associated with Phaethon, the son of Helios. Phaethon is said to have persuaded his father to let him drive the chariot containing the sun for a single day. He was so reckless, however, that the chariot careened first too close then too far away from Earth. Eventually, Zeus killed Phaethon with a thunderbolt to restore normality but the damage was done. The story was used to explain why some parts of the world were too cold, and other parts too hot for human habitation. From the UK, Auriga is visible all year round.

The much-delayed Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor started test production, delivering power to the national grid, which over time is expected to reduce the need for electricity imports and lead to lower prices. It comes amid growing fears of an energy war in Europe, after Moscow threatened to close a major gas pipeline to Germany if European countries ban Russian oil imports. Once fully operational Olkiluoto 3, operated by TVO (Teollisuuden Voima), is expected to meet 14% of Finland’s electricity demand, reducing the need for imports from Russia, Sweden and Norway. “Olkiluoto 3 will decrease Finland’s import dependency and it will become a cheaper price zone,” Aurora Energy Research economist Alexander Esser told Reuters. Finland’s first new nuclear plant in four decades, Olkiluoto 3 had originally been due to open in 2009 but was plagued by technological problems that became the subject of lawsuits. The plant started test production at just over 0.1 gigawatt, a small fraction of its capacity, with increase to full, regular electricity output planned by the end of July. Finland’s net imports of power averaged 13 terawatt hours (TWh) over the last few years, which should drop to 5 to 8 TWh by 2025 with Olkiluoto 3 in operation. TVO said in a statement: “OL3 significantly improves Finland’s electricity self-sufficiency and helps in achieving carbon neutrality goals.” The invasion of Ukraine has forced European governments to reconsider their reliance on Russian energy. Russia supplies about 40% of Europe’s gas and over a quarter of its crude oil. Germany’s economy minister says his country wants to virtually end the importation of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. Germany currently gets about half of its coal and oil from Russia. The German government last month halted the Nord Stream 2 project intended to bring additional natural gas from Russia to Germany. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, threatened to impose an embargo on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany this week, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports entirely. The European Commission has proposed plans to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy. British and European gas prices both hit record highs earlier this month, as the war continued to wreak havoc on energy markets, threatening to worsen the cost-of-living crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/11/sunak-heads-to-us-to-unveil-latest-news-on-australian-nuclear-sub-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-11T22:30:31Z","webTitle":"Sunak heads to US to unveil latest news on Australian nuclear sub deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/11/sunak-heads-to-us-to-unveil-latest-news-on-australian-nuclear-sub-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/11/sunak-heads-to-us-to-unveil-latest-news-on-australian-nuclear-sub-deal","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak will fly to San Diego on Sunday to unveil plans for supplying Australia with nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus scheme amid concerns about the growing threat from China. A major announcement 18 months in the making is expected when the UK prime minister meets his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, and US president Joe Biden. In response to concerns about Beijing’s economic coercion and foreign policy aims, the UK’s defence and security strategy for the 2020s is being updated, and the revised version is due to be published on Monday. It will address “increasingly concerning behaviour” by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s government, the “grave risks” posed by Russia after a renewed assault on Ukraine and “hybrid threats” to Britain’s economy and energy security, No 10 said. Before his trip to California, Sunak hailed “global alliances” – such as the one formed between the UK, US and Australia in September 2021 – as “our greatest source of strength and security”. He added: “I am travelling to the US today to launch the next stage of the Aukus nuclear submarine programme, a project which is binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.” The UK would be “secure, prosperous and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners”, thanks to the programme and the updated Integrated Review, Sunak said. He will hold meetings on Sunday night and Monday, before flying back home before the budget on Wednesday. The visit threatened to cast a shadow over Sunak’s trip on Friday to Paris, given the French government reacted with consternation to its own submarine deal with Australia being scrapped a year and a half ago. Britain is stepping up efforts to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific, and Sunak hopes the trilateral summit on Monday will demonstrate his commitment to standing up to China, which senior Conservative MPs have urged him to take a tougher stance on. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that Sunak had expressed delight to fellow ministers about the outcome of negotiations, with multiple sources saying they believed the eight nuclear-powered submarines would be based on British designs. Such a move would safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, since the full fleet may not be seaworthy until the 2040s. Reports this week suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US. Under the three-way deal the US and UK will agree to share secret reactor technology. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor – putting its diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut”, according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. Charles Edel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, has described the Aukus pact as a calculated gamble. “It’s a bet that by further integrating industrial capacities and increasing interoperability it will significantly augment the capabilities of our allies, make them more powerful, and ultimately change Beijing’s calculations about its security environment,” he said. “And that by doing so, it will help stabilise a region that has been badly destabilised by China’s rapid expansion of military capabilities and increasingly aggressive foreign policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/audio/2023/jan/19/the-power-of-the-union-politics-weekly-uk","type":"audio","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"The power of the union?

The decline in prices was mostly driven by the abundance of available energy generated by renewable sources, combined with the relatively low demand for energy for heating or cooling, caused by normal springtime temperatures. Negative prices often occur when there is an excess supply of electricity in the market. This can happen when renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydro produce a large quantity of electricity that exceeds demand and cannot be stored for later use. In such cases, producers may offer negative prices to incentivise wholesale consumers to take the surplus electricity off the grid and avoid overloading the system. This situation occurred due to an area of high pressure dominating across much of central and north-west Europe, providing lots of solar power generation across the area. Meanwhile, Finland experienced an oversupply of hydroelectric power resulting from excessive springtime meltwater, which in turn led to negative prices here as well. High pressure will remain positioned over Britain and Ireland through the rest of this week and most of next week, leading to predominantly dry and settled conditions across much of the UK, central and northern Europe. Plenty of sunshine is expected, potentially leading to further opportunities for low or negative prices during the daylight hours. Spring-time school holidays including half-term in the UK and Whitsuntide in Germany have pushed many families to take their kids closer to the Mediterranean to enjoy some warmth and the seaside. Nevertheless, areas of low pressure will drive the development of showers and some thunderstorms across popular European resorts, some of these heavy with the risk of frequent lightning and surface flooding.

Now situated south-east of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, Mawar’s current projections forecast the typhoon to continue to degrade while veering to the north-east before dissipating by the weekend.

Russia has unleashed a missile barrage including the use of hypersonic missiles – that cannot be intercepted – targeting energy infrastructure across Ukraine, in the largest such attack in three weeks. The Ukrainian president said critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region – 440 miles from any military battlefield – according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike, and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. A sixth person died during strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor said. What did Russia use in the barrage? Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. What else is happening? The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents were without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Mitch McConnell in hospital after fall in Washington DC The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, was taken to hospital in Washington DC after he tripped and fell at a hotel. “This evening, Leader McConnell tripped at a local hotel during a private dinner. He has been admitted to the hospital where he is receiving treatment,” David Popp, the communications director for McConnell, said in a statement. In 2019 McConnell, who is 81 and a survivor of childhood polio, tripped and fell at his home in Kentucky, fracturing his shoulder. The Senate has been without several members recently because of illness. The office of Dianne Feinstein, 90, said the senator was taken to hospital last week to be treated for shingles. Senator John Fetterman, 53, who suffered a stroke during his campaign last year, was expected to remain out for some weeks as he received care for clinical depression. When will McConnell be back? It is unclear if McConnell will be discharged today and if that would have an effect on scheduled votes. The South Dakota senator John Thune is the Senate’s No 2 Republican. Tucker Carlson, who ‘passionately hates’ Trump, shows more Capitol footage The Fox News host Tucker Carlson told an associate he “hated” Donald Trump “passionately”, new filings in a $1.6bn defamation suit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems revealed. Even as the filings were reported on Tuesday, Carlson continued to broadcast January 6 security footage in his attempt to cast the deadly attack on Congress as “peaceful chaos” arising from a protest of Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden. “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait,” Carlson said in a text on 4 January 2021, two days before the riot. He also wrote: “I hate him passionately … What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.” Many observers think the Dominion suit, over the broadcast of lies about electoral fraud by Trump and his allies, could prove seriously costly to Fox News. Hosts and executives up to and including Rupert Murdoch have been shown to have said Trump was lying, and to have ridiculed surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, but to have broadcast their claims regardless. What did Fox News really think of Trump and the 2020 election? Even as they went on air to cast doubt about whether the vote went off fairly, many Fox News personalities privately doubted Trump’s claims. “He’s acting like an insane person,” Sean Hannity, one of the network’s best-known personalities, allegedly said of Trump, according to a Dominion court filing. What has Stephen Colbert said about Carlson? “You’d think that once the people gaslighting you on a daily basis have been revealed to be liars – say, in multiple text messages and a $1.6bn court filing by Dominion Voting Systems – they would pump the brakes. But apparently, some people are just addicted to being dicks,” he said.

Stat of the day: California governor halts $54m contract with Walgreens – ‘We’re done’ The California governor, Gavin Newsom, withdrew a $54m contract with Walgreens yesterday after the pharmacy chain indicated it would not sell an abortion pill by mail in some conservative-led states. Newsom ordered state officials not to renew a contract with Walgreens to buy specialty pharmacy prescription drugs for California’s prison healthcare system, including antiviral and antifungal drugs and medication used for congestive heart failure. Walgreens has received about $54m from the contract, which expires on 30 April. Newsom’s office said the state would buy the drugs elsewhere. “California will not stand by as corporations cave to extremists and cut off critical access to reproductive care and freedom,” Newsom said. Don’t miss this: Scabby the Rat is an American labor icon. Why are his manufacturers disowning him? In New York – a city poised to hire its first “rat tsar” after rat sightings doubled in the past year – streetside rodents are fairly commonplace. But the rat stationed on a Union Square curb is something of a different beast. This one is roughly 10ft tall, with incisors the size of iPads. Its eyes are bloodshot, its claws extended, and its belly marked with what look like open, oozing sores. Depending who you ask, its name is Scabby, or just the Rat. He appears beside workers nationwide – at an Amazon warehouse in Illinois over the summer of 2021, at a Philadelphia Starbucks the following July. The rat elicits polarizing opinions (they tend to fall neatly along worker-management lines). But to both sides, Scabby is, as one organizer told NPR in 2021, an “iconic symbol of a labor dispute”.

In Jeremy Hunt, the Conservatives appear to have found a brain. In the autumn statement, he pledged to double annual energy efficiency investment with new funding of £6bn. That is the good news. The bad news is that doubling does not happen until 2025, when the energy bills crisis may be over and the climate crisis will be even worse. Hunt is the fourth chancellor of 2022 and the chaos in the Tory party has meant unnecessary delays in making people’s homes warmer and cheaper to heat. The trouble goes back almost a decade in fact, when David Cameron’s ditching of “green crap” saw insulation rates fall by 95%, a decision that has cost bill payers billions. Details of the new efficiency plans are yet to be published but will include a new “energy efficiency taskforce”. Its goal will be to reduce the UK’s energy use in buildings and industry by 15% by 2030, a fairly modest ambition. On the supply of low-carbon energy, Hunt backed expensive nuclear power as well as offshore wind, but said nothing on the fastest and by far the cheapest sources: onshore wind and solar. With blocks on the latter, the Tories continue to be wildly out of tune with voters. Hunt increased the windfall tax on soaring oil and gas profits from 25% to 35%, making the total tax rate 75%. That may look high, but remember that the oil and gas belongs to the nation – you and me – not the fossil fuel companies, and other nations like Norway have higher rates. A windfall tax on electricity producers of 45%, including wind, solar and nuclear, was also announced by Hunt. Depending on how that is implemented, the green energy companies could end up being taxed more than the fossil fuel producers. That would be mad when green energy is the solution to the energy and climate crisis, and while oil and gas firms can get 91% tax rebates by investing in more oil and gas. Electric car sales are in the fast lane and Hunt announced that from 2025, owners will need to start paying vehicle excise duty, sometimes misleadingly referred to as “road tax”. That is a disincentive to go electric but by that date electric cars will not only be cheaper to run, as they already are, but also very probably cheaper to buy than petrol or diesel models. On the climate crisis, Hunt said: “With the existential vulnerability we face, now would be the wrong time to step back from our international climate responsibilities. So I can confirm that, despite the economic pressures, we remain fully committed to the historic Glasgow climate pact agreed at Cop26, including a 68% reduction in our own emissions by 2030.” The government is not currently on track to meet this target. The autumn statement’s purpose was to find £55bn in tax rises and spending cuts to stabilise the UK economy. To put that in context, that’s about 18 days’ worth of the pure profit the global oil and gas industry has been banking for the past 50 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T15:36:32Z","webTitle":"What is nuclear fusion and what have scientists achieved?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","fields":{"bodyText":"Physicists are a-buzz over new results from nuclear fusion experiments. But what have they found, and how big a breakthrough is it? What is nuclear fusion? We experience nuclear fusion every day – it is the process that gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars. In brief, it involves light atoms being smashed together to produce heavier ones, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. To do this ourselves takes some serious engineering. At the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a weak laser beam is split and the energy amplified to give 192 laser beams. These are used to heat the walls of a small gold can, called a hohlraum, to more than 3m degrees Celsius, resulting in the emission of X-rays. These X-rays heat a millimetre-sized capsule within the hohlraum that contains two forms of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. The heat causes the surface of the capsule to explode outwards, forcing its contents to implode – in other words, the deuterium and tritium are forced together rapidly at very high pressure and temperature. The upshot is that, in the hottest part of the fuel, fusion occurs, resulting in the formation of helium nuclei. As one helium nucleus has slightly less mass than the combination of one deuterium and one tritium nucleus, the difference in mass is released as a burst of energy. In the right conditions the helium nuclei produced in this process can transfer their kinetic energy to the remaining fuel, heating it up and triggering yet more fusion. Should this happen, it becomes possible to release more energy than was put into the experiment by the lasers, a condition known as ignition. What just happened? Researchers at the NIF have announced that, for the first time, they have managed to do just that. The team used 2.05MJ of energy to heat the fuel with lasers, releasing 3.15MJ of energy. Is that a lot of energy? No, not really. The difference – 1.1MJ – is about 0.3kWh. It takes about 0.2kWh to boil a full kettle of water. Why is everyone so excited? Nuclear fusion research has been going on for 70 years and this is the first time scientists have managed to demonstrate ignition – a positive energy gain. The results show that it is indeed possible to use laser fusion to generate energy – a crucial proof of principle that will spur on research to develop the technology. That matters because it is hoped nuclear fusion will eventually provide a near-limitless, safe and clean source of energy. How far away are we from powering our homes via nuclear fusion? Miles. And miles. Only a small amount of excess energy was generated in the latest experiments – and it took a lot of energy, around 500MJ, to power the lasers in the first place. Such reactions would also need to happen at a much greater frequency – about 10 times a second – and be far cheaper to run before nuclear fusion could actually be used to power even a kettle. Jeremy Chittenden, a professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: “Anyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor. “The experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-13T05:50:20Z","webTitle":"Fukushima water to be released into ocean in next few months, says Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","fields":{"bodyText":"The controversial release of more than a million tonnes of water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will begin in the northern spring or summer, Japan’s government has said – a move that has sparked anger among local fishing communities and countries in the region. The decision comes more than two years after the government approved the release of the water, which will be treated to remove most radioactive materials but will still contain tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials insist the “treated” water will not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment, but the plans face opposition from fishermen who say it risks destroying their livelihoods, almost 12 years after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier. The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned – a process expected to take 30 to 40 years. Japan’s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted. The plan’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology – known as Alps – can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had “grave concerns” about the proposed release. Writing in the Guardian, the forum’s secretary general, Henry Puna, said Japan “should hold off on any such release until we are certain about the implications of this proposal on the environment and on human health, especially recognising that the majority of our Pacific peoples are coastal peoples, and that the ocean continues to be an integral part of their subsistence living”. The South Korean government, which has yet to lift its ban on Fukushima seafood, has said that releasing the water would pose a “grave threat” to marine life. Fishing unions in the area oppose the release, warning it would cause alarm among consumers and derail more than a decade of efforts to reassure the public that Fukushima seafood is safe to eat. Under the plan approved by Japan’s cabinet on Friday, fishermen who fear that the release will impact their livelihoods will be able to access a new ¥50bn ($385m) fund, the Kyodo news agency said. “We would like to thoroughly explain these measures to fishing communities and other relevant parties while listening to their concerns,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said at the meeting, according to Kyodo. The liquid, which Japanese officials claim is “treated” rather than “contaminated”, comprises water used to cool the damaged reactors, and rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Kyodo said the IAEA had conducted several safety reviews of the plan and would issue a report based on its findings, as well as providing support before, during and after the discharge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T19:17:33Z","webTitle":"Putin says Russia will halt participation in New Start nuclear arms treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has said Russia will halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, in a speech devoted to the one-year anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” the Russian president said during a speech characterised by grievances against the west. “In this regard, I am forced to state that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty.” The full implications of Putin’s threat were not immediately clear. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts said that if Putin now went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments, it would be a serious blow. “The announcement by Russia that it’s suspending participation in New Start is deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters on a visit to Athens. “We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does. We’ll of course make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.” The 2010 New Start treaty provides for limits on the deployed strategic nuclear arsenals of the world’s two largest nuclear powers, capping strategic nuclear assets at 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed missiles and heavy bombers. The treaty also provides for joint monitoring of each side’s deployed nuclear arsenals, as well as coordination through the bilateral consultative commission. Later, the Russian foreign ministry announced that Moscow would continue to abide by the limits set by the treaty and would also continue to exchange information with the US on planned launches of intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles under the 1988 Ballistic Missile Launch Notification Agreement. Those decisions were taken in order to “maintain a sufficient degree of predictability and stability in the nuclear missile sphere”, the ministry said in a statement. US officials said the Biden administration had feared Putin might decide to withdraw Russia from the treaty altogether and no longer recognise the agreed limits on the nuclear arsenal. The Russian foreign ministry had summoned the new US ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, for a meeting on Tuesday, saying it had an important announcement, prompting speculation of a full withdrawal. Instead, they said, very little had changed as a result of Putin’s announcement formalising the status quo. “This is a big deal; suspension of the treaty is not equal to withdrawal but in reality, it could become really close over time,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher in the weapons of mass destruction and other strategic weapons programme at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research. In a nearly two-hour speech, Putin said the treaty could not be kept separate from the war in Ukraine and “other hostile actions of the west against our country”. He said: “Now, through Nato representatives, they are putting forward, in fact, an ultimatum: you, Russia, must fulfil everything that you have agreed on, including the Start treaty, and we will behave as we please.” In particular, Putin fumed over Nato support for Ukraine, and claimed the west was seeking a “strategic defeat” of Russia. He also claimed the US was seeking to rewrite the post-second world war security architecture, “to build an American-style world where there is only one master”. Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R Politik analysis firm, said of the speech: “It feels more doomed, much more irreconcilable. Almost like it is either them or us, even if he does not say it.” The decision to suspend participation in the arms treaty would mark a new low in US-Russia relations and arms control, one of the few topics on which Moscow and Washington DC could find common ground. “Details matter, but if Russia is indeed stopping data exchanges and notifications, it would fundamentally change the nuclear relationship with Russia. [The US and Russia] have had some form of strategic arms control in place since 1972,” wrote Jon Wolfsthal, who served as a senior adviser to Barack Obama for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council. “[The] US still has extensive ability to monitor Russian nuclear forces, even without a treaty in place. But the loss of agreements will increase uncertainty and chances of misunderstanding, inflate threat perception and fuel accelerating arms race,” he tweeted. Putin, in his speech, promised tax breaks for businesses and government support for fighters returning from the war in Ukraine. Much of the speech was extremely conservative given the stress put on Russian society by the country’s first mass mobilisation since the second world war. He said Russia would resume testing of nuclear weapons if the US did the same, a serious escalation that could mean it was preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Withdrawing from New Start would theoretically allow Russia to end compliance with limits of deployed nuclear weapons and would stop meetings of the bilateral consultative commission, the implementing body of the treaty. When the treaty was extended in 2021, the then Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said the US “cannot afford to lose New Start’s intrusive inspection and notification tools”. Those notifications include information on the numbers, locations and technical characteristics of weapons systems and facilities. “Failing to swiftly extend New Start would weaken America’s understanding of Russia’s long-range nuclear forces,” Kirby said then. Baklitskiy said: “Russia will probably stick to the New Start treaty limits, at least for now, but it will be harder for the US to verify compliance only using the national technical means. And I would expect the US also suspending its obligations.” “One silver lining is that Russian decision is political and can be easily reversed if the overall political relations change,” he added. “Also, since the treaty exists, getting back to implementation would be straightforward. The problem, of course, is that there is no change of political relations in sight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T05:52:02Z","webTitle":"As G7 leaders start to arrive, Japan PM prepares push in Hiroshima for nuclear weapons pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","fields":{"bodyText":"The war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan will dominate G7 discussions this week, but host Fumio Kishida is expected to carve out time to push for a pledge on nuclear weapons when leaders meet in Hiroshima, the first place on Earth targeted by an atomic bomb. The leaders began to arrive on Thursday, ahead of an expected visit on Saturday to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, which contains exhibits showing the scale of the tragedy that unfolded after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people by the end of the year. Kishida, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other G7 leaders are expected to see displays including a simulation that reproduces the wave of destruction that followed the bombing, with the human cost represented by the mundane – ripped school uniforms, the blackened contents of a bento lunchbox, a tricycle whose three-year-old owner would die within 24 hours. The need to reference the dangers of nuclear weapons has intensified since Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima in 2016. Vladimir Putin has refused to publicly rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, while North Korea continues to develop more sophisticated missiles theoretically capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US mainland. Kishida’s decision to select Hiroshima – where he has a constituency – to host the summit comes with a heavy dose of symbolism, whose most striking physical presence, the A-bomb dome, will be within sight of the leaders when they lay flowers at a cenotaph to the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the A-bombing almost eight decades ago. In the run-up to the summit, Kishida spoke of his desire for “a world without nuclear weapons”, although campaigners point to the failure by Japan – part of the US nuclear umbrella – to sign a 2021 UN treaty banning the possession and use of nuclear weapons. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said of the planned group visit to the peace museum. Pressure is building for a reference to nuclear weapons, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, this week calling on the G7 leaders to declare they will not use nuclear weapons “in any circumstances”. “This is the moment in which we must insist on the need of revitalising disarmament, and especially nuclear disarmament,” Guterres told Japanese media ahead of his visit to Hiroshima. Ageing hibakusha – survivors of the Hiroshima attack – say the summit is their final chance to make the case for disarmament directly to the US, France and Britain, the group’s three nuclear powers. Some are expected to meet the G7 leaders. “I want to see the leaders commit to getting rid of nuclear weapons,” Shigeaki Mori, an 86-year-old survivor, said. “I also know it’s very hard to get them to go that far.” Kishida wants to use the summit to press his guests to commit to transparency on stockpiles and arsenal reductions. But amid heightened tensions centring on Russia, North Korea and China – all nuclear powers – expectations for a breakthrough are low. US officials have said that Washington will not be pushing an independent agenda on nuclear weapons in Hiroshima, while senior German government sources said nuclear disarmament was not a high priority, adding that it was “important mainly for Japan”. There is unlikely to be more unity on how to respond to China’s growing military and economic clout, with an adviser to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, insisting that the G7 “is not an anti-Chinese G7”. But the group will be under pressure to address Beijing’s escalating threats against Taiwan and the west’s economic and supply chain dependency on China, while ensuring they do not alienate a powerful and important trading partner. “[The G7] have to address economic security and how to deal with sensitive technologies,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “Everything is part of the great power competition that is taking place between the United States and Russia, and the United States and China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-18T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"How Florida’s Republican supermajority handed Ron DeSantis unfettered power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","fields":{"bodyText":"If there’s one word Floridians have heard plenty of since their Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, was sworn in for a second term last month, it is “freedom”. The rightwing politician, expected by many to seek his party’s 2024 presidential nomination, sprinkles the word freely as he ramps up the “anti-woke” crusade he believes can propel him to the White House. It turns out, following a special legislative session last week that handed DeSantis victory after victory in his culture wars against Disney, transgender communities, students, migrants and communities of color, the person with the greatest freedom in Florida to do exactly as he pleases is the governor himself. In November, voters granted DeSantis’s wish of a veto-proof Republican supermajority in the state legislature. In a five-day session, those politicians validated every one of his demands. They granted DeSantis total control of the board governing Disney, the theme park giant with whom he feuded over his anti-LGBTQ+ “don’t say gay” law. They gave him permission to fly migrants from anywhere in the US to destinations of his choosing, for political purposes, then send the bill to Florida’s taxpayers. And they handed unprecedented prosecutorial powers to his newly created, hand-picked office of election “integrity”, pursuing supposed cases of voter fraud. The special session is over but DeSantis’s devotion to seeking retribution against those who disagree with him is not. Last week, after a backlash, the Florida High School Athletic Association backed away from forcing female students to chronicle their menstrual histories on medical forms, a requirement seen by many as a thinly-veiled attempt to keep transgender athletes out of girls’ sports. Exactly one week later, a Republican House committee proposed allowing DeSantis to turf out those who made the decision and replace them with his own appointments. It’s a familiar playbook: the Disney legislation allows the governor to supplant sitting officials on its governing tax authority with his own picks; his “hostile takeover” of the liberal New College of Florida last month was accomplished by swamping its board of trustees with hand-picked allies and conservative Christians. In what critics say was a particularly petty act earlier this month, DeSantis moved to strip the liquor license from the non-profit Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation because it hosted a drag show, which some children attended with parents. The threats keep coming. The notoriously thin-skinned DeSantis wants to cut state ties with the College Board, which criticised him for a “PR stunt and posturing” when he demanded it revise an advanced placement college course on African American studies he said “lacked educational value”. “No politician should silence the stories of Black and brown people who helped create our country. Our democracy and constitutional values must transcend such hateful and callous political agendas,” said Tiffani Lemon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Others accuse DeSantis of fascism, among them the progressive Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost, whose vocal criticism of the governor long predated his election in November. “If you disagree with Ron DeSantis he’ll abuse his power to close down your business, take over your school, remove your classes and unconstitutionally fire you,” Frost said in a tweet. “I encourage folks to look up the definition of fascism then read these headlines.” Other Florida Democrats see the DeSantis-ordered special legislative session as his “get out jail free card”, sweeping away legal obstacles and other hurdles that threatened to stall his policy objectives. His original plan to abolish the Disney authority would have saddled residents with $1bn in bond debt, so instead he asked the legislature to rename and restructure it. Judges threw out charges against several ex-felons the governor said voted illegally because his state office lacked prosecutorial authority, so a new law was drafted to give it. DeSantis’s administration was sued for flying migrants from Texas to Massachusetts in a “vile political stunt” stunt last year, because the existing law restricted migrant removals to those physically in Florida. So he changed the law. “It’s just a clear example of DeSantis changing the law because he broke the law,” said Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman who voted against the new measure to allow the governor to fly migrants anywhere. “Republicans like Ron DeSantis don’t care about the rules. If they don’t like the rules, they change them. And if they can’t change them they try to destroy them, as we saw with the [January 6] insurrection.” ••• Gregory Koger, chair of political science at the University of Miami, said the issues the legislature addressed suggested “speed over thought” when the DeSantis administration was planning its strategies. “It’s not unusual at all to see legislators and executives fixing problems in the laws that they have passed,” he said. “You could have had a slow, bipartisan, well-thought-out approach to changing the relationship between Florida and Disney, but that isn’t what we observed. We saw a law being drafted and passed as an act of retribution, and now they have to come back and say, ‘Well, when we passed our act of retribution, here’s what we actually meant.’ “Same with changing the guidelines for Florida to fly migrants. That seems like an effort to back out of a legal challenge to their behavior by retroactively saying the legislature is actually OK tricking people into getting on a plane in Texas and flying them from there, rather than finding actual undocumented people in Florida.” In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s press secretary, Bryan Griffin, defended the governor, saying he was bringing “a new era of accountability and transparency” to Disney, Florida’s biggest employer. “Businesses in Florida should operate on a level playing field,” Griffin said. “In 1967, the Florida legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which gifted extraordinary special privileges to a single corporation. “Until Governor DeSantis acted, the Walt Disney Company maintained sole control over the district. This power amounted to an unaccountable corporate kingdom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:20:48Z","webTitle":"Swagger, power and all-star cameos: Foo Fighters roar back with new drummer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","fields":{"bodyText":"Were he not already a singer, multi-instrumentalist, writer and occasional actor, Dave Grohl could earn a living making life’s lemons into lemonade. The ex-Nirvana drummer started fronting Foo Fighters in the fallout of Kurt Cobain’s death; nearly 30 years later, they’re earnestly promoting themselves as “the last great American rock band”. A similar sense of answering immeasurable grief with tireless forward motion permeates the band’s latest return to the spotlight, a live stream to unveil their next phase. Just over a year ago, in March 2022, Taylor Hawkins, the band’s drummer of 25 years, died of a sudden cardiac arrest with drugs including opiates, antidepressants and benzodiazepines found in his body. He was 50 years old. Fans mourned a musician so skilled that he somehow made the kit his own while sharing stages with Gen X’s favourite drummer; his bandmates publicly celebrated his life by playing two stadium-sized tribute shows featuring guest appearances from everyone from Lars Ulrich to Kesha. But tonight’s live stream, titled Preparing Music for Concerts, is firmly focused on the present and future. The footage fades into view in black and white and begins with a scene of innocuous band banter: “Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone in your own band on stage?” Grohl randomly asks his four surviving cohorts. Their subsequent smiley reminiscences mark the first sign of normality in the Foos camp in more than a year. Hawkins isn’t mentioned once over the ensuing hour, which dwells instead on the question of his replacement for their forthcoming US tour, a potentially morbid question that they answer with trademark good humour. The Foos are known for this kind of lightheartedness, found in everything from the Learn to Fly video to their Carrie-parodying Ice Bucket Challenge. Today, a cavalcade of superstar drummers bust into the band’s Studio 606, only to excuse themselves. Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith? Someone’s Mercedes is blocking his car. Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee? He’s just bringing in some Chinese food. Tool’s Danny Carey? He’s only here to groom the Foos’ poodles. The punchline is that actual fill-in Josh Freese was in the same room, perched behind an offscreen drum kit, the entire time. For anyone who’s paid attention over the past year, him landing the job isn’t a stunning revelation. The chameleonic session musician – who already has Nine Inch Nails, Bruce Springsteen, Paramore, Weezer and Guns N’ Roses on his CV – played at both Hawkins memorial concerts in 2022. Last week, he left his posts in both the Offspring and Danny Elfman’s band. The writing was on the wall, no matter how star-studded the smokescreen. Similarly unsurprising is that Freese plays Foos songs as if Hawkins mentored him. Once the music starts, All My Life is just as volatile a post-hardcore explosion as it was on 2002’s One By One. The scrambling pace plays to Freese’s punk roots (as well as Grohl’s underrated throat-shredding howls) and he even gets a mid-song solo. By the time he has thrashed his way through Monkey Wrench, to the visible awe of his new bandmates, it’s clear the sheer extent to which this stream is all about him. He and Grohl frequently geek out on drumming between songs; the frontman also quizzes him on his punk band the Vandals and his days playing in a Disneyland covers act at 12 years old. The other throughline of tonight’s proceedings is that the Foos are releasing a new album next week (2 June) and it can’t promote itself. The stream’s monochrome colour scheme is doubtlessly designed to tether it to But Here We Are, with its black and white cover and music videos. Both singles, classic-sounding anthem Rescued and bittersweet yet uptempo rocker Under You, are performed, the latter especially evocative in its exploration of loss: “Think I’m getting over it / But there’s no getting over it.” They debut a new song, Nothing at All. The verses’ strummed guitar and swaggering bassline crescendo with a pop-hardcore hook. “Never mind, love and hate! / Peace of mind, it’s a bit too late!” Grohl snarls to end a lyrical breakdown of a tumultuous relationship. Together, these three songs paint a picture of a back-to-basics rock record, eschewing the prog of 2017’s Concrete and Gold and the dance flourishes of 2021’s Medicine at Midnight. It may prove an apt soundtrack to a band clearly craving a renewed sense of normality in the aftermath of tragedy. Ultimately, what Preparing Music for Concerts deals best in is reassurance: the Foos can still play powerfully and enjoy themselves with their first new drummer since 1997, while their forthcoming output seems set to resume the band’s hard-rocking ways. Dave Grohl’s lemonade stand is still doing brisk business. • But Here We Are is released via Roswell/RCA on 2 June • This article was updated on 22 May 2023 to more accurately report the drugs in Hawkins’ body when he died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/12/breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-could-mean-near-limitless-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T19:15:23Z","webTitle":"Breakthrough in nuclear fusion could mean ‘near-limitless energy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/12/breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-could-mean-near-limitless-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/12/breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-could-mean-near-limitless-energy","fields":{"bodyText":"Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest to unlock a “near-limitless, safe, clean” source of energy: they have got more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. Nuclear fusion involves smashing together light elements such as hydrogen to form heavier elements, releasing a huge burst of energy in the process. The approach, which gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars, has been hailed as having huge potential as a sustainable, low-carbon energy source. However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition. That was, it seems, until now. According to a report in the Financial Times, which has yet to be confirmed by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that is behind the work, researchers have managed to release 2.5 MJ of energy after using just 2.1 MJ to heat the fuel with lasers. Dr Robbie Scott, of the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Central Laser Facility (CLF) Plasma Physics Group, who contributed to this research, described the results as a “momentous achievement”. “Fusion has the potential to provide a near-limitless, safe, clean, source of carbon-free baseload energy,” he said. “This seminal result from the National Ignition Facility is the first laboratory demonstration of fusion ‘energy-gain’ – where more fusion energy is output than input by the laser beams. The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated. “The experiment demonstrates unambiguously that the physics of Laser Fusion works,” he added. “In order to transform NIF’s result into power production a lot of work remains, but this is a key step along the path.” Prof Jeremy Chittenden, professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, agreed. “If what has been reported is true and more energy has been released than was used to produce the plasma, that is a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting,” he said. “It proves that the long sought-after goal, the ‘holy grail’ of fusion, can indeed be achieved.” But experts have stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is a long way from being a mainstay of the energy landscape. To start with, 0.4MJ is about 0.1kWh – about enough energy to boil a kettle. “To turn fusion into a power source we’ll need to boost the energy gain still further,” said Chittenden. “We’ll also need to find a way to reproduce the same effect much more frequently and much more cheaply before we can realistically turn this into a power plant.” Prof Justin Wark, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, added that while, in principle, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory could produce such a result about once a day, a fusion power plant would need to do it 10 times a second. And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves. However, Chittenden stressed the NIF was designed for a scientific demonstration, not as a power plant. “The efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,” he said. “Anyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor,” he added. “The experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.” The latest results, if true, top the last big breakthrough by the facility which came just last year when it was announced that the team had hit 70% of the laser energy put in to the experiment released as nuclear energy. • This article was amended on 13 December 2022 to replace a Rubicon reference, on usage grounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T18:12:25Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern call for return of Stormont power sharing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","fields":{"bodyText":"Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern have made an impassioned plea to the Democratic Unionist party to revive power sharing in Northern Ireland and help end the period of political instability, saying the “people on this island need them”. The former British and Irish prime ministers told a conference in Belfast on Monday that the region’s leaders had a responsibility to break a political deadlock and safeguard peace. Speaking on a panel shared with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ahern urged the DUP to “stay the road with us” in shoring up the Good Friday agreement. The former taoiseach said Northern Ireland must overcome the DUP’s focus on a “small detail” – a reference to post-Brexit arrangements – in order to focus on major issues. Blair, in a thinly veiled reference to the DUP, implored the region’s leaders to restore the Stormont assembly and executive, which have been mothballed by a DUP boycott. “You know in your heart of hearts what the right thing to do is and you should just get on and do it,” he said. The appeals added to pressure on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party to end a political vacuum that has destabilised Northern Ireland and overshadowed the 25th anniversary of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. It was the first day of a three-day conference on the future of Northern Ireland. Hosted by Queen’s University Belfast, it has drawn architects of the peace deal. Rishi Sunak, the European Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen and senior White House representatives are to follow on Wednesday. Invitations had also been sent to all seven living former UK prime ministers: Liz Truss; Boris Johnson; Theresa May; David Cameron; Gordon Brown; Blair; and John Major. On a visit to Belfast last week, Joe Biden offered a $6bn (£5bn) carrot of US investment if power sharing is restored but he avoided singling out the DUP. Analysts say the party is unlikely to make any move towards reviving Stormont until after local elections next month. Ahern, one of the few Irish leaders past or present with credibility among unionists, said the impasse must end. “You can’t wait around for ever. You can’t have elections to institutions a year ago and then nothing happens,” he said. Referencing the DUP, he said: “The people of Northern Ireland need them, the people on this island need them.” George Mitchell, a former US senator who chaired the peace talks 25 years ago, urged politicians to emulate the “courage and wisdom” of their predecessors. “It is not a sign of weakness to resolve your differences by democratic and peaceful means,” he said. “To the contrary, it is a sign of strength and of wisdom, and it clearly reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland.” Peace, he said, must not be allowed to “slip away”. Hillary Clinton, in her role as chancellor of Queen’s, chaired the talk with Ahern, Blair and her husband, the former US president. The three men paid tribute to each other as well as to John Hume, David Trimble and other Northern Ireland politicians who helped clinch the deal. Blair lauded Ahern’s ability to weather abuse. “People would come and be really rude to him,” he said. “I got offended on his behalf, but he was never really offended.” Bill Clinton paid his own compliment to the former taoiseach, joking: “Bertie had the kind of BS that I always wished I had. I wanna be Bertie when I grow up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T21:20:09Z","webTitle":"Republicans criticize Biden’s trip to Kyiv as Putin withdraws from nuclear treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"For Joe Biden to safely visit Ukraine, the White House spirited him out of the country in the middle of the night and made reporters traveling with him swear a temporary oath of secrecy – none of which could protect the president from attacks by Republicans. The journey was only complicated further by an unexpected announcement. In a speech marking a year since he sent his armies over Ukraine’s borders in an ill-fated attempt to take Kyiv, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced his country would no longer participate in the last nuclear arms control treaty with the United States still standing, and accused the west of posing an existential threat to his country. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” Putin said, accusing Washington of striving “to build an American-style world where there is only one master”. Biden continues his travels in Poland, but conservative Republicans have scrambled to downplay the president’s decision to travel to an active foreign war zone without a significant American military presence, arguing in appearances on Fox News that Biden would have been better off visiting the border with Mexico, or the Ohio town stricken by toxic waste spilled from a derailed train. “The president’s now spent more time in Kyiv than he has at our southern border,” said Kevin Hern, a House Republican from Oklahoma who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee. Fellow House Republican David Kustoff gave Biden “kudos” for the trip but brought up the derailment earlier this month of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, a village of 4,761 residents where many are demanding answers about the spill’s health effects. “There are a lot of people here in the US that would say he probably should have gone to Ohio and visited with the people who have been afflicted by the derailment first,” Kustoff said on Fox News. On Twitter, the rightwing lawmaker and Ukraine foe Marjorie Taylor Greene said Biden “chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden.” The comments from Republicans were, in many ways, business as usual for the Biden presidency. The GOP has hammered him since practically the start of his administration for the increase in migrant arrivals on the southern border, and more recently seized on the East Palestine derailment to argue his administration is turning a blind eye to an environmental disaster. “That was the biggest slap in the face. That tells you right now he doesn’t care about us,” East Palestine’s mayor Trent Conaway said of Biden’s Ukraine trip in an appearance on Fox News. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on Tuesday it would take over the response to the 3 February derailment in the eastern Ohio town, with Biden’s EPA chief Michael Regan vowing rail operator Norfolk Southern “will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they’ve inflicted on this community”. Last month, Biden visited Texas’s border with Mexico shortly after he announced new restrictions on migrants who arrive in the United States, which drew opposition from advocacy groups and progressive Democrats. But the comments from the Republican lawmakers could also be harbingers of major political battles to come. Since Russia’s invasion, the US has supplied Kyiv with about $30bn worth of pivotal weaponry and other aid, but the country will likely need more to hold off Moscow’s troops. That will require the agreement of both the Biden administration and his Democratic allies controlling the Senate, as well as the Republicans in control of the House of Representatives. “We’re all for Ukraine, we support their effort against the Russians as we approach the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, but the message that I get from constituents all across west Tennessee and I think other members of Congress get is, we need to stop the spending,” Kustoff said. “We need to take care of people at home first before we look to take care of people across the world.” The sentiment wasn’t unanimous among Republicans. GOP senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement that he was “very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine”, and called it “the right signal to send at the right time”. He urged the Biden administration to keep pressure on Russia by designating it a state sponsor of terrorism, and to send advanced fighter jets to Ukraine. “Words are powerful, but they must be followed by powerful actions as well,” Graham said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-01T01:14:35Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un vows to ‘exponentially’ increase nuclear warhead production","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","fields":{"bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has vowed to ramp up the production of nuclear warheads and build a more powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), while singling out South Korea as his country’s “undoubted enemy”, North Korean state media reported on Sunday. In a sign of deepening animosity towards the US, South Korea and Japan, Kim called for an “exponential increase” in the regime’s nuclear arsenal during an address at a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ party that ended on Saturday. The leader’s statement was released hours after North Korea fired a ballistic missile towards its eastern waters, starting 2023 as it had ended the previous year, when it conducted a record number of weapons tests. It also launched three ballistic missiles on Saturday, days after sending five drones across the heavily armed border that has divided the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean war ended in a truce, but not a peace treaty. “The currently established situation calls for our country doubling down our efforts to strengthen our military power overwhelmingly to safeguard our sovereignty, safety and basic national interest to cope with the dangerous military moves by the US and other hostile forces that target us,” Kim said, according to the official KCNA news agency. Kim, who has used recent year-end party meetings to outline major policies, accused Washington and Seoul of carrying out a “plot to isolate and stifle” Pyongyang, calling it “unparalleled in human history”. South Korea, he said, had become “our undoubted enemy”, describing it as “hell-bent on an imprudent and dangerous arms buildup”. The North test-fired more than 70 ballistic missiles in 2022 following the breakdown in 2019 of nuclear diplomacy that culminated in three meetings between Kim and the then US president, Donald Trump, as well as summits with the then South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in. In November, it resumed testing ICBMs for the first time since 2017, successfully launching a Hwasong-17, a new, bigger missile potentially able to strike anywhere in the US. North Korea’s rapid weapons development enhances its deterrent capability and, according to some experts, puts it in a a stronger position to win sanctions relief and other concessions from the US in any future negotiations. In a worrying escalation, last year it approved a new law authorising the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons – a shift Kim referenced at the weekend. “Our nuclear force considers it as the first mission to deter war and safeguard peace and stability and, however, if it fails to deter, it will carry out the second mission, which will not be for defence,” he said, according to KCNA. The news agency said Kim had also ordered the development of a new type of ICBM with a swift, counterstrike capability and, adding that the country’s first military spy satellite would be put into orbit as soon as possible. The regime already possesses long-range missiles theoretically capable of striking the US mainland, but there is disagreement over whether it has fully functioning nuclear weapons. Ankit Panda, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the reference to a new ICBM appeared to concern a solid-propellant system, which can be launched more quickly than a liquid-fuelled ICBM. “We should expect to see larger, solid-propellant missiles tested soon,” Panda said. The South’s military detected Sunday’s launch from the Pyongyang region around 2.50am, the joint chiefs of staff said in a statement. It said the missile travelled about 400km (250 miles) before falling into the water between the Korean peninsula and Japan. The joint chiefs of staff called the launch “a grave provocation” that hurts peace and security on the Korean peninsula and around the world. It said South Korea closely monitored North Korean moves in coordination with the US and maintained a readiness to deal with any provocations. The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the launch highlighted “the destabilising impact” of North Korea’s unlawful weapons programs. It said US commitments to defend South Korea and Japan “remain ironclad”. On Saturday, North Korea fired three short-range ballistic missiles towards its eastern waters. North Korea’s state media confirmed on Sunday that the country conducted the test-firings of its super-large multiple rocket launcher to test the weapon’s capability. KCNA said three shells fired from the launcher on Saturday accurately hit an island target off its eastern coast. It said North Korea fired another shell from the launcher towards its eastern waters on Sunday. Outside experts categorise weapons fired from the launcher as ballistic missiles because of their trajectories, ranges and other characteristics. The North’s missile launch for a second straight day could be a response to South Korea’s recent rocket test, which is related to its plan to establish space-based surveillance to better monitor North Korea. On Friday, South Korea’s military said it test-launched a solid-fuel rocket, a type of a space launch vehicle it plans to use to put its first spy satellite into orbit in coming years. Animosities between the rival Koreas have deepened since early last week, when South Korea accused North Korea of flying drones across the countries’ heavily fortified border for the first time in five years and sent its own drones towards the North. South Korea acknowledged it failed to shoot down any of the North Korean drones it said were found south of the border. But South Korea has vowed to bolster its air defence network and get tough on future provocations by North Korea.

I can save his committee a lot of time. The money should go to Peter Wohlleben, the German forester whose book The Hidden Life of Trees was the most improbable and encouraging blockbuster of 2015. Wohlleben’s idea is this: leave forests alone. Stop fiddling with them, thinking that we can deal with climate change better than nature. If we fiddle, our Romes will burn. The Hidden Life argued that trees are social and sensate. The Power of Trees shows that they can be our saviours. But it’s terribly hard to let ourselves be saved. We think we can be the authors of our salvation. We are doers by constitution. Of course, there are things we could and should be doing, but in terms of forestry practice, often what’s billed as part of the solution is part of the problem. Anyone who has planted a tree in their garden knows that it has a profound effect – it makes your garden cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Forests do that on a grand scale. A deciduous forest in summer is often as cool as a lake. Berlin is 15C warmer than the ancient forests nearby. The coniferous monocultures so beloved of commercial foresters are not such good coolers: they’re up to 8C warmer than their deciduous counterparts. Forests cool by transpiring. If there’s no water, there’s no cooling. Drought can kill trees fast, but trees have many sophisticated ways of dealing with it, and Wohlleben sets them out. As a species, we have survived many climatic changes by changing our behaviour – and that’s how trees survive, too. Crucially, trees learn from their past traumas and produce offspring programmed with those lessons. Trees that have narrowly escaped drought are more prudent in the future: they slow their growth and ration their drinking. They have two main methods for influencing their children: the first is good parenting. Mother trees regulate their children’s growth by changing the rate at which they drip-feed them with sugar solution through root networks, and children growing in the rain and light shadow of the mother won’t drink heavily or overeat. The second is epigenetic inheritance, which enables useful behavioural traits to be passed on fast to future generations. Deciduous forests in particular remove greenhouse gases effectively, and sequester carbon for as long as they live. The rate of carbon capture increases until they’re around 450 years old. Cut them down and burn them and you’re releasing carbon dioxide not just from the wood, but also from the forest floor – as the soil, previously cool in the shade, warms and therefore accelerates the metabolism of microorganisms, which consume the remaining humus. The way of the woods is not the way of the market, and if we see forests as warehouses we are doomed. Foresters must be more than stockholders, shelf stackers, shippers and restockers. We need a radically new ethos. Deciduous trees are not “harvest-ready” at 200 years: they are teenagers. Tree planting isn’t necessarily good: the collateral costs may be extortionate. We must interrogate comforting expressions such as “renewable energy”, and learn the real cost of our toilet paper. If we don’t learn to leave the trees alone, the trees will eventually be alone anyway – but without us. Wohlleben brilliantly and readably shows us how urgent and how hard it is to do nothing. • Charles Foster’s next book, Cry of the Wild, is published in May by Doubleday.

That this narrative is self-serving is obvious, as is its implied message: that they should be allowed to get on with their habits of “creative destruction” (to use Joseph Schumpeter’s famous phrase) without being troubled by regulation. Accordingly, any government that flirts with the idea of reining in corporate power should remember that it would then be standing in the way of “progress”: for it is technology that drives history and anything that obstructs it is doomed to be roadkill. One of the many useful things about this formidable (560-page) tome is its demolition of the tech narrative’s comforting equation of technology with “progress”. Of course the fact that our lives are infinitely richer and more comfortable than those of the feudal serfs we would have been in the middle ages owes much to technological advances. Even the poor in western societies enjoy much higher living standards today than three centuries ago, and live healthier, longer lives. But a study of the past 1,000 years of human development, Acemoglu and Johnson argue, shows that “the broad-based prosperity of the past was not the result of any automatic, guaranteed gains of technological progress… Most people around the globe today are better off than our ancestors because citizens and workers in earlier industrial societies organised, challenged elite-dominated choices about technology and work conditions, and forced ways of sharing the gains from technical improvements more equitably.” Acemoglu and Johnson begin their Cook’s tour of the past millennium with the puzzle of how dominant narratives – like that which equates technological development with progress – get established. The key takeaway is unremarkable but critical: those who have power define the narrative. That’s how banks get to be thought of as “too big to fail”, or why questioning tech power is “luddite”. But their historical survey really gets under way with an absorbing account of the evolution of agricultural technologies from the neolithic age to the medieval and early modern eras. They find that successive developments “tended to enrich and empower small elites while generating few benefits for agricultural workers: peasants lacked political and social power, and the path of technology followed the vision of a narrow elite.” A similar moral is extracted from their reinterpretation of the Industrial Revolution. This focuses on the emergence of a newly emboldened middle class of entrepreneurs and businessmen whose vision rarely included any ideas of social inclusion and who were obsessed with the possibilities of steam-driven automation for increasing profits and reducing costs. The shock of the second world war led to a brief interruption in the inexorable trend of continuous technological development combined with increasing social exclusion and inequality. And the postwar years saw the rise of social democratic regimes focused on Keynesian economics, welfare states and shared prosperity. But all of this changed in the 1970s with the neoliberal turn and the subsequent evolution of the democracies we have today, in which enfeebled governments pay obeisance to giant corporations – more powerful and profitable than anything since the East India Company. These create astonishing wealth for a tiny elite (not to mention lavish salaries and bonuses for their executives) while the real incomes of ordinary people have remained stagnant, precarity rules and inequality returning to pre-1914 levels. Coincidentally, this book arrives at an opportune moment, when digital technology, currently surfing on a wave of irrational exuberance about ubiquitous AI, is booming, while the idea of shared prosperity has seemingly become a wistful pipe dream. So is there anything we might learn from the history so graphically recounted by Acemoglu and Johnson? Answer: yes. And it’s to be found in the closing chapter, which comes up with a useful list of critical steps that democracies must take to ensure that the proceeds of the next technological wave are more generally shared among their populations. Interestingly, some of the ideas it explores have a venerable provenance, reaching back to the progressive movement that brought the robber barons of the early 20th century to heel. There are three things that need to be done by a modern progressive movement. First, the technology-equals-progress narrative has to be challenged and exposed for what it is: a convenient myth propagated by a huge industry and its acolytes in government, the media and (occasionally) academia. The second is the need to cultivate and foster countervailing powers – which critically should include civil society organisations, activists and contemporary versions of trade unions. And finally, there is a need for progressive, technically informed policy proposals, and the fostering of thinktanks and other institutions that can supply a steady flow of ideas about how digital technology can be repurposed for human flourishing rather than exclusively for private profit. None of this is rocket science. It can be done. And it needs to be done if liberal democracies are to survive the next wave of technological evolution and the catastrophic acceleration of inequality that it will bring. So – who knows? Maybe this time we might really learn something from history.

His tenure was consequential. A Democrat, he battled for civil rights and came to oppose the Vietnam war. He believed Americans were citizens, not subjects. Chairing the intelligence select committee was his most enduring accomplishment. James Risen, a Pulitzer-winning reporter now with the Intercept, sees him as a hero. The Last Honest Man is both paean and lament. “For decades … the CIA’s operations faced only glancing scrutiny from the White House, and virtually none from Congress,” Risen writes. “True oversight would have to wait until 1975, and the arrival on the national stage of a senator from Idaho, Frank Church.” For 16 months, Church and his committee scrutinized the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency and their many abuses. Amid the cold war, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, Congress grappled with the balance between civil liberties and national security, executive prerogative and congressional authority. Political assassinations, covert operations and domestic surveillance finally received scrutiny and oversight. A plot to kill Fidel Castro, with an assist from organized crime, made headlines. So did the personal ties that bound John F Kennedy, mob boss Sam Giancana and their shared mistress, Judith Campbell Exner. Giancana was murdered before he testified. Before John Rosselli, another mobster, could make a third appearance, his decomposed body turned up in a steel fuel drum near Miami. One subheading in the Church committee’s interim report bears the title: “The Question of Whether the Assassination Operation Involving Underworld Figures Was Known About by Attorney General Kennedy or President Kennedy as Revealed by Investigations of Giancana and Rosselli”. Against this grizzly but intriguing backdrop, Risen’s book is aptly subtitled: The CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, and the Kennedys – And One Senator’s Fight to Save Democracy. The Last Honest Man is a gem, marbled with scoop, laden with interviews. In 2006, Risen won the Pulitzer prize for his coverage of George W Bush’s warrantless wiretapping program. Risen was also part of the New York Times team that snagged a Pulitzer in the aftermath of September 11. He endured a seven-year legal battle with the Bush and Obama justice departments, for refusing to name a source. Eric Holder, Barack Obama’s attorney general, backed off. But he earned Risen’s lasting ire. In 2015, Risen called the Obama administration “the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation”. Holder, he said, “has done the bidding of the intelligence community and the White House to damage press freedom in the United States”. And then came Donald Trump. Risen now describes Dick Cheney’s efforts to block Church’s committee, as chief of staff to Gerald Ford. To Cheney’s consternation, the president “refused to engage in an all-out war”. So Cheney nursed a grudge and bided his time. In 1987, Cheney and congressional Republicans issued a dissent on Iran-Contra, blaming the Church committee for the concept of “all but unlimited congressional power”. Later, as vice-president to George W Bush, Cheney zestily embraced the theory of the unitary executive, the global “war on terror” and the invasion of Iraq. The Last Honest Man also doubles as a guide to high-stakes politics. Risen captures Gary Hart and the late Walter Mondale on the record. Both Democratic presidential hopefuls – Mondale the candidate in 1984, Hart the frontrunner, briefly, in the 1988 race – after sitting on Church’s committee. The three senators were competitors and colleagues. Paths and ambitions intersected. Church entered the 1976 Democratic presidential primary late – and lost to Jimmy Carter. Carter weighed picking Church as his running mate but opted for Mondale instead. “I think he had seen me on a Sunday news talk show, talking about the Church committee, and he liked how I looked and sounded,” Mondale told Risen. It was for the best. Church never cottoned to Carter. Carter and his aides returned the favor. They “hated Church right back”. David Aaron, a Church aide and later deputy to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security adviser, recalls: “I know that whenever Church’s name came up, Brzezinski would grimace.” In 1980, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush beat Carter and Mondale in a landslide. The election also cost Church his seat and the Democrats control of the Senate. Four years later, Mondale bested Hart for the Democratic nomination, only to be shellacked by Reagan-Bush again. Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers whistleblower, leaves his mark on Risen’s pages too. He played a “previously undisclosed role in the Church committee’s investigation of the assassinations of foreign leaders”, Risen reports in a lengthy footnote. In an interview, Ellsberg says he “met privately” with Church in 1975, as the committee investigated assassination plots. In Risen’s telling, Ellsberg cops to handing Church “a manilla envelope containing copies of a series of top-secret cables” between the US embassy in South Vietnam and “the Kennedy White House”. The messages purportedly pertained to the “US role in the planning of the 1963 coup against South Vietnamese president [Ngô Đình] Diệm that resulted in his assassination”. The Church committee interim report referred to cable traffic between the embassy in Saigon and the White House but contained no mention of Ellsberg. In other words, assassinations and coups carry a bipartisan legacy. It wasn’t just Eisenhower and Nixon, Iran and Chile. Risen hails Church as “an American Cicero” who “offered the United States a brief glimpse of what it would be like to turn away from its imperialistic ambitions … and return to its roots as a republic”. He overstates, but not by much. Iraq and its aftermath still reverberate. But for that debacle, it is unlikely Trumpism would have attained the purchase it still possesses. Our national divide would not be as deep – or intractable. Church died in April 1984, aged just 59.

It dates back to the league’s humble beginnings in the late 1990s, when the now-defunct Houston Comets won the first four WNBA finals, defeating the New York Liberty in three of them. The Minnesota Lynx were next, appearing in six finals between 2011 and 2017, winning four titles. But those teams were built in very particular ways. The Comets became the WNBA’s first dynasty because the league distributed players to each team ahead of its inaugural season and had no idea how good four-time WNBA finals MVP Cynthia Cooper would be. Whereas the Lynx were built primarily through the draft, being fortunate enough to select Maya Moore and Seimone Augustus No 1 overall, and later trading for Sylvia Fowles. The WNBA’s new superteam era is fundamentally different, because the rising tides in Las Vegas and New York were not born out of the league’s mistakes or chance in the draft, but through free agency. A new collective bargaining agreement ratified in 2020 gave players the freedom to choose their destinations for the first time in league history. It came to a head this winter when two of the greatest players of all time headed for opposite sides of the US for two of the league’s biggest markets, with Candace Parker joining the reigning champion Las Vegas Aces and Breanna Stewart going to the New York Liberty. As a result of an unprecedented level of player movement, the WNBA’s next era is going to look fundamentally different. But it could also be a whole lot better for everyone involved. “I’m a big rivalry [person],” Parker said after a recent Aces practice. “You think about the foundation of every single thing and every single person that tunes into anything: college basketball has UConn and Tennessee, right? Put it on the map … You think about the NBA with the Celtics and the Lakers and their rivalry, right? And I think in order to [succeed], you need those types of rivalries.” The Aces signed two-time MVP Parker this offseason after running away with the 2022 WNBA championship behind an MVP season from center A’ja Wilson. Parker will join a star-studded starting five of Wilson, finals MVP Chelsea Gray, MVP-finalist Kelsey Plum, and All-Star starter Jackie Young, giving them four former No 1 overall draft picks and four MVP trophies. There have been hiccups though: this week the team were docked a 2025 first-round draft pick and head coach Becky Hammon was given a two-game ban for “impermissible player benefits and Respect in the Workplace policies”. Meanwhile, after selecting star guard Sabrina Ionescu first overall in 2020 and losing in the first round of the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, the Liberty have joined the Aces as the clear betting favorites to win the 2023 WNBA championship after remaking their starting five. The Liberty traded for center Jonquel Jones before signing last year’s scoring leader and MVP runner-up, Stewart, adding two former MVPs. Courtney Vandersloot, the league’s active all-time assists leader and a former overseas teammate of Jones and Stewart, joined the picture too. The WNBA was already seeing immense growth without any high-profile superteams or rivalries, with the 2022 WNBA season being the most viewed since 2006. Meanwhile, the WNBA is in the process of making games more accessible to viewers, signing a new TV deal with Scripps to televise Friday night games this season. And women’s basketball is growing, with this year’s women’s NCAA Tournament having its highest viewership ever, with the title game between Iowa and LSU drawing 9.9 million viewers. But sports leagues are top-down structures. As much as the WNBA was growing organically, it needed a push to reach its full potential. After all, fans are often drawn by the biggest markets and best teams and go from there. In fact, it’s not a stretch to say that the rivalry between Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson’s Los Angeles Lakers saved the NBA in the 1980s. While the four-year stretch between 2015-18 when LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry’s Golden State Warriors met in the NBA finals featured the highest NBA viewership of any span since Michael Jordan’s run in the late 1990s. The WNBA has all the momentum in the world right now, and its new superteam era should bring in more casual fans. “We’re trying to elevate the level,” Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello said. “We’re trying to promote our game and create those rivalries. I think that’s great for the WNBA. Hopefully more fans can come and watch us, and we’re selling it... We think we got some pretty special players, but you know Vegas got some special players [too].” “I think that’s what it was going to make us work really hard and get up in the morning,” Liberty co-owner Clara Wu Tsai added. “Is to be able to beat that team in the West.” But superteams don’t only help bring in casual fans to a league that has struggled with attendance and needs extra revenue if it is going to expand beyond 12 teams by its stated goal of 2025 – they also help elevate the standard of play. And there is no better proof of this than the fact that both Parker and Stewart are the MVP-caliber players they are today because they were inspired by past superteams. “I would say watching the Houston Comets play [inspired me] for sure,” Gray recently told the Guardian. “It was a first of its kind, and you’re always looking to see the first one to do something … we were watching it, kind of aspiring to be in that position.” “Yeah, I raised the roof for sure,” Parker added, referring to Comet’s guard Cynthia Cooper’s famous celebration. “And I definitely tried to go out and shoot like Tina Thompson. You know, shoot a runner and Euro [step] like Cynthia Cooper.” Stewart was busy winning four straight national championships at the University of Connecticut during the height of the Lynx and Los Angeles Sparks rivalry, saying: “It was intense. That’s what I think of. And especially the players on both teams, the way that they had so much talent and they were able to play well together, I think that that’s what I remember about those two … When you’re a basketball player, you want to play with other great players.” But players like Parker and Stewart never really had the opportunity to be “surrounded by greatness,” as Stewart put it, until now. By limiting the amount of times a franchise can “core” a player and lock them up from as many as four one-year periods down to just two with the new CBA, the WNBA has empowered players to make their own decisions. “I think what you’re seeing is the player empowerment era, if you want to call it that, where players are getting to choose the location of their legacy, and I think that’s really important,” Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said. Stewart is the vice president of the WNBA Players Association and has used her platform to push the league forward. “I think that as far as player movement, it’s something that the league needs,” Stewart said during Liberty media day. “And you’re gonna see it happening a lot more and that means just player movement, fan engagement is going to go from one team to another team. It’s just gonna make it more exciting, make things more spicy,” Stewart added, admitting that she used emojis on Twitter to create a buzz around her own free agency, helping the WNBA become a 12-month a year league like the NBA. “But it’s what the league needs to continue to kind of grow the way that we want it to and the way that it should.” Despite being at different stages of their careers, 37-year-old Parker and 28-year-old Stewart made their free agency moves for ostensibly the same reasons: In addition to having familial ties to the regions and wanting to play with other great players – both taking pay cuts to do so – Parker and Stewart were tired of sacrificing their own desires and well-being for the betterment of the league. It was time to prioritize themselves, and specifically their health and their bodies. In fact, Parker and Stewart both spoke about their desire to maximize the rest of their careers and to be treated well by franchises with ownership groups that have shown a willingness to go above and beyond for their players. So they each left smaller markets for the richest ownership groups and biggest markets in the league. Given the WNBA’s historically lackluster treatment of athletes, it makes sense. Parker has never had her own locker in her 15 year career. She came into the league during a time when teams had to work around NBA schedules and switch facilities constantly, and she has never had the ability to get up shots at a dedicated practice facility whenever she wanted to because it was always shared with other teams. Plus, like most WNBA players, she has also had to play overseas to supplement her salary until a recent media gig with Turner Sports has kept her in the States. And, again, we are talking about one of the greatest players of all time. “That’s just a part of the grind. That’s a part of growing it,” Parker said about her past experiences in Los Angeles and Chicago. “But at the end of the day, I think the reason why I’m here is because I feel like we deserve this at some point.” Parker joins an Aces team with a brand new, 64,000 square foot, state-of-the-art practice facility – the first of its kind in the WNBA. It’s complete with a weight room, training room, hydro tread, infrared sauna, nutrition bar, a hyperbaric chamber that Parker has already napped in, and a hot and cold tub she uses every day. The Aces are owned by Mark Davis (who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders and is worth a reported $2bn) and Tom Brady. They play at the Michelob Ultra Arena, a 12,000-seat arena on the Las Vegas Strip, where they had average crowds of 5,607 last season and will have seven nationally televised games in 2023. “I think it factored into my decision a lot,” Parker told the Guardian about ownership’s willingness to spend money and treat players right. “I think as a 37-year-old player, as a vet, taking care of my body is first and foremost. So to be able to have access to not just a locker but a facility that you can go and rehab and have the latest machines ... that can help my body be as prepared as it can be going into year 16.” Stewart still plays overseas each offseason because that is where she makes the majority of her salary. She does so despite what happened with former overseas teammate Brittney Griner, who was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months after bringing hashish oil into the country. Griner’s ordeal has forced other WNBA players to reconcile with their decisions to play overseas and to push the WNBA for a more livable salary. Considering that Stewart plays basketball year-round and returned to the United States just days before the start of Liberty training camp, her body and health were top of her mind when making a decision to leave the Seattle Storm for the Liberty this offseason. Like the Aces, the Liberty have invested in their facilities in recent years. The team’s owners, Joe and Clara Tsai, are estimated to be worth over $8bn, significantly more than any other WNBA team owners. That has allowed them to move the team to the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn, a 17,732 capacity arena that they own and that is also home to the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets. There the Liberty have created their own modern practice facility. They have also heavily invested in their performance team in order to improve their athletes’ mental health and wellness, as well as recovery. “I think one of the most neglected areas in this league for a long time is player health,” Kolb said. “Especially when you have players going overseas, they’re coming back, we have a camp, and they’re all in various states of condition… We want to have the best performance team period. And that’s what we’re committed to doing because that’s what these players deserve.” Stewart told the Guardian that those investments were “very important” in her free agency decision. Adding: “They want to make sure that this team is getting everything that they need. And you realize that the moment that you walk in: You walk in, there’s breakfast, and then there’s treatment, and then there’s the weight room, and then there’s the court, and there’s all these people around who are trying to help you. “The WNBA should have teams that have a one-stop shop. I shouldn’t have to travel all over the place to get everything I need. And here in New York, you can get that right here. So, to be able to come in and have that is amazing because what I just touched on before is: I want to be my best and I want to be able to do everything I can to get that and that means the resources, and here we have all the resources.” What has become clear during the 2023 offseason is that the best players in the world are tired of sacrificing their bodies and well-being for the betterment of the league, and that it is the WNBA’s turn to meet them where they deserve to be met. The hope is that Parker and Stewart’s decisions will reverberate throughout the league and accelerate growth, pressuring the other 10 ownership groups to invest in similar resources so that the biggest markets don’t always have a competitive advantage, and so that the standard of the entire league is elevated. “Pressure might be a strong word. I’m sure everybody’s aware, at least on some level, of what everybody’s doing,” vice president of basketball operations and assistant general manager of the Dallas Wings, Travis Charles, said over the phone. “...I think new things like a practice facility and all of that stuff, I think will be the norm sooner than later. “I believe the majority of the teams were heading in the direction of enhanced player care regardless of whether it was forced by the CBA or not. I think just time and commitment and the new wave of owners has vowed to do things specifically here for our players that we weren’t able to before … So I think it might hasten or quicken what was already going to happen.” After all, the WNBA is still relatively young, with practice facilities, bigger arenas, expansion, and charter flights the most likely next dominoes to fall as the league continues to grow and improve. “I hope that this has inspired others to kind of step up the game because I know that’s how it is with ownership: It’s a competition,” Parker said. “So now, who’s going to be next?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T13:00:18Z","webTitle":"Sunak to focus on carbon capture and mini-nuclear reactors in energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","fields":{"bodyText":"An energy security strategy will be launched “shortly”, Rishi Sunak has promised, with a focus on ramping up carbon capture and small modular reactors to develop homegrown energy and meet net zero commitments. Ministers have been forced to rework their plans after a ruling by the high court last July. It found that the government’s net zero strategy was unlawful due to a breach of the 2008 Climate Change Act, given the document did not outline how climate policies would meet legally binding carbon budgets. Campaigners have called for regulation to be cut for new clean energy projects in order to speed up Britain’s energy independence and for potential savings to be passed on to consumers. Sunak told reporters on his way to a trilateral meeting with the Australian and US leaders: “Shortly we will be outlining, in the energy security strategy, an approach forward.” He said it would focus on “carbon capture and storage, small modular reactors and the like”, and talked up the success of investment in research and development of energy sources such as offshore wind. “I am very confident that we will continue to have a very vibrant set of companies and jobs created in the UK as we transition to net zero, and our track record should give everyone confidence we know how to do this and get it right,” Sunak said. Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of the “pro-growth” campaign group Britain Remade, blamed Britain’s energy insecurity for “surging energy bills and unsustainable levels of borrowing”. He promoted the benefits of small modular reactors, which the World Economic Forum has identified as a new breed of power source that does not emit greenhouse gases and is less exposed to traditional dangers such as earthquakes and meltdowns. The technology is sparking a renaissance for nuclear energy, with a range of next-generation small modular reactors being developed in the US. However, Richards said they would “not be delivered at the pace needed without streamlining the regulatory approval process”, and he called for a list of prospective places, including a list of decommissioned nuclear sites, to be drawn up. “The government will not be able to cut Britain’s dependency on expensive foreign gas and reduce energy bills without reforming the planning system that holds back clean energy infrastructure such as onshore wind, the cheapest form of energy available,” Richards said. “With the vast majority of major clean energy projects being developed outside London and the south-east, boosting investing in clean energy infrastructure will deliver a significant economic boost and job creation in Britain’s former industrial heartlands across the north and Midlands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T10:41:20Z","webTitle":"Harness the power of AI to boost your professional communications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","fields":{"bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

They travelled 6,000 miles to Cape Town, swapping Strawberry Hill for Table Mountain and a game played in sweltering 30C heat in a majestic stadium. Quins, led by Danny Care, were game opponents but a Stormers side with its all-Springbok front row, were always going to have a power game that would be difficult to cope with even after a week of acclimatisation in the sun and it is the Stormers who will meet the winners of Sunday’s match between Exeter and Montpellier. After the earlier dismantling of Munster by the Sharks, the South African sides have the air of guests who have been invited to the European party only to make off with all the booze. The scoreline is a trifle misleading. Quins scored three converted tries in the last seven minutes when the Stormers decided their work was done for the day. It was only then that Marcus Smith was able to sprinkle a little bit of his magic on proceedings. Quins can look devastating when a game opens up and their scrum coped well on a pitch that rapidly opened up, too, but for the other 73 minutes Stormers were in control. They had recorded emphatic wins over London Irish and Clermont at the DHL Stadium in the pool stages and Quins soon discovered that this citadel would be hard to storm. Quins had not laid a hand on the ball before the Stormers flanker Deon Fourie crossed their line after all of 55 seconds after a smart move down the blindside. The breathless start continued with an instant retort from Quins, Alex Dombrandt crashing over in the corner from a lineout. The No 8 did not have had a happy Six Nations, but he continues to thrive at club level. Smith’s conversion from the touchline helped settle those early nerves. Shrugs from the Stormers. They simply scored from a lineout of their own, their captain, Steven Kitshoff, barging his way over. Three tries in eight minutes was a nightmare for any watching defence coaches, but it was dream stuff for the marketing men. Quins earned a minor victory with a scrum won against the head and their defence looked pretty resolute as the waves of Stormers’ attacks continued, full-back Nick David twice stopping his opposite number, Damian Willemse, in his tracks. Just before the half-hour mark, though, Fourie, in the slipstream of a driving maul from a lineout, grabbed his second try. The Stormers somehow repelled some intense pressure from Quins before the interval, leaving the home side 10 points ahead before a welcome break from the heat. There was a sense that for all their sterling work Quins could not quite match the Stormers for power. Quins knew their number was up seven minutes after the break when an extraordinary finish by Willemse after a cross-kick from Manie Libbok. Willemse somehow evaded Joe Marchant’s tackle and the touchline to score in the corner for the Stormers’ fourth try. Libbok continued to spurn chances of conversions, but it hardly mattered, especially when the fly-half landed a long-distance penalty to stretch the lead. The visitors thrive on unstructured rugby and some of their handling as they mounted second-half attacks was outstanding, but the Stormers kept them at arm’s length with unyielding defence. Willie Engelbrecht, a replacement for the outstanding Fourie, rubbed salt into Harlequin wounds with a fifth try. Dombrandt’s second try and André Esterhuizen’s score, both made by Smith’s quick thinking, were terrific and some consolation before Marchant went over with the last move of the game. Fourie was given the man of the match award for his tireless efforts. The moment of the match was Willemse’s astonishing try. Quins knew this was never going to be a holiday in the sun and they are vulnerable when this competition enters the knockout stages. They remain the great entertainers of the Premiership but, with the playoffs looking out of reach, they would reflect on the long flight home that their season is as good as over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T08:30:15Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Succession; Great Expectations; The Power; Wellmania – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","fields":{"bodyText":"Succession (Sky Atlantic/Now) Great Expectations (BBC One) | iPlayer The Power (Amazon Prime Video) Wellmania (Netflix) And so, Sky Atlantic’s fourth and final 10-part season of Jesse Armstrong’s drama Succession arrives as per, with waiters swishing through bearing silver trays of costly, tasty-looking canapes that you sense are probably poisoned. The end of the last series saw Roy progeny Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) left reeling in the actual dust at their mother’s Tuscan wedding as billionaire patriarch-dementor Logan (Brian Cox) effectively blocked them from real power in family company Waystar Royco. There was an added twist of the dagger for Shiv from (now estranged) husband and Logan-stooge Tom (Matthew Macfayden), whose comic double act with Greg (Nicholas Braun) makes them Succession’s weasel-hearted answer to Ant and Dec. I’ve often felt too thick to watch Succession (all that sabre-rattling business speak). Also too common to appreciate the tsunami of super-rich signifiers (linen separates that scream “Existential crisis on Necker Island”; helicopters casually summoned like post-pub Ubers). All the well-heeled angst that makes you (almost, not quite) forgive them their great wealth. It’s all on warped view again in the first episode (titled The Munsters), as Logan strolls contemptuously around his birthday party, an event so grimly salubrious that he ends up hanging out with his bodyguard, telling him: “You’re my best pal.” Meanwhile, eldest Roy manchild Connor (Alan Ruck) frets that his 1% share of the US presidential race “could get squeezed”. Elsewhere, his siblings lifelessly gabble about their new “bespoke info hub” venture, barely bothering to towel-whip each other with one-liners (“Your face is giving me a headache”). Then they realise they might be able to outwit the old man on a major business deal. “This is not about getting back at Dad,” lies a suddenly alert Shiv. Peeking a few episodes ahead, rest assured that Succession is as magnificent as ever: a bravura television opera whose supple script, stealthy plotting and lurching twists provide all the mood music you need. Though in this coolly subdued opener it’s hard to know what’s uncoiling. A motorway pileup of estrangements (Shiv and Tom; Logan and “the rats”; Connor and any shred of common sense)? A show trial of Logan’s fatherly failings? Is that episode title a clue: as suspected, were the Roys always just the Munsters with weapons-grade affluenza? Whatever’s going on, adopt the brace position for the start of the endgame. On BBC One, Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders) is grinding everyone’s gears with his new six-part adaptation of Charles Dickens’s 1861 social-climbing odyssey Great Expectations, concerning young Pip’s craving to become a “gentleman”. This includes (spoilers ahead) reimagined everything: dialogue, scenes, order, as well as swearing and colourblind casting. And, to come: opium addiction and the kinky spanking of businessman Mr Pumblechook (played by Matt Berry, who arguably went through worse in Toast of London). Then there’s the question: is yet another interpretation necessary? The 2011 Sarah Phelps BBC adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Ray Winstone is still on iPlayer. Then again, Knight (who also did A Christmas Carol), was, like Pip, raised in a blacksmithing family: how could his take not be interesting? Moreover, demented jilted bride Miss Havisham, played here by Olivia Colman, is one of the undisputed big-ticket “rock stars” of classical literature – are people truly tired of her? In the event it’s a mixed bag of an opener. There are strong showings, including Johnny Harris as desperate convict Magwitch, who accosts Pip on the grey, gloopy marshes, and nicely conjured atmospheres: silvery mists; candle flames tickling the gloom. However, despite the controversy, episode one is somewhat ponderous. It feels an age before Pumblechook arranges for child-Pip (Tom Sweet) to meet aloof ward Estella (Chloe Lea; the pair are played as adults by Fionn Whitehead and Shalom Brune-Franklin). The first instalment is practically over before La Havisham creaks into view. But what a Havisham this is: yes, a peak-bitter, eternally bridal nightmare of tatty antique lace, though with opium-glazed teeth and what resembles a toppling garden trellis of soiled, shredded bed linen on her head. Along with the madness, Colman plays her cold, cruel, furious; an implacable gothic Fury with beady alligator eyes. I love it. Far from a twittering, spacey, weeping willow of a Havisham, Colman’s hard, nasty take gives the character back her sting, her agency, her mojo. Ample enough reason, for now, to keep watching. The Power (Amazon Prime Video) is a nine-part adaptation of Naomi Alderman’s bestselling novel (named by Barack Obama as one of his favourite books of 2017). Created by Alderman, Claire Wilson and Raelle Tucker, it’s a global anthology about mainly young women developing the ability to produce electricity with their bodies; how it emboldens and galvanises them, but also turns the patriarchy against them. This is a bubbling sci-fi stew with echoes of Salem – for inevitably, once their fingertips start crackling and sparking, females are damned as witches. You can see why Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid’s Tale, is an admirer of Alderman’s: The Power’s themes include not only empowerment but fightback, survival, revenge and toxic masculinity. It’s Gilead with added electrons. In a pitch-perfect cast, standouts are Toni Collette playing a mayor (“Teen girls are setting shit on fire? I’m not surprised”), Toheeb Jimoh as a journalist, and the main young women: Halle Bush, Zrinka Cvitešić, Auli’i Cravalho and Ria Zmitrowicz, whose scenes with her terrifying London gangster father (a brilliant Eddie Marsan) are heart-stopping. While not flawless (a meandering start; too much padding), The Power is (dare I go there?) electrifying. On Netflix, there’s Wellmania, an eight-part Australian dramedy created by Brigid Delaney and Benjamin Law, based on Delaney’s book Wellmania: Misadventures in the Search For Wellness. It stars Celeste Barber (also known for spoofing the Instagram posts of the likes of Cindy Crawford) as a pushing-40, hard-partying New York-based food writer who gets stuck in Sydney because of physical and, it turns out, emotional issues. I was expecting an industrial skewering of the wellness industry, but apart from the odd pithy one-liner (“I jogged for the first time – I feel like I’ve been fucked by a truck”) this is more of an amusing Everywoman odyssey. You’ll need to like Liv, but that’s easy enough: slapping on deodorant, lounging in Spanx, Barber exudes a crisp comic energy. While Wellmania is a bumpy ride, if you stick with it, it gets deeper.

Here are today’s key developments: Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious.” Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded in several parts of Ukraine during long-range Russian bombardments on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Zelenskiy’s office said. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. A new EU sanctions package will be adopted in the next two weeks, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday, the Kyiv Independent reports. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has condemned Russian president Vladimir Putin’s announcement on placing nuclear weapons in Belarus. “As long as President Putin has nuclear weapons, Europe cannot be safe. He justfies this dangerous escalation by citing decades of NATO nuclear sharing. As long as countries continue their complicity in considering nuclear weapons as anything other than a global problem, this helps give Putin cover to get away with this kind of behaviour,” ICAN’s interim executive director Daniel Hoegsta said in a statement. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. She added that details “are disclosed by the three aforementioned officials only when there is a military task requiring it. Because information is also a weapon and we fight with it too,” referring to the supreme commander in chief (president), the defense minister, and the chief commander. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. Here are some additional comments from president Putin on the agreement with Belarus. Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by July 1, Putin said, adding that Russia would not actually be transferring control of the arms to Minsk. He added that Russia has already stationed 10 aircraft in Belarus capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons, Reuters reports. Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which borders Poland, Putin said. “We agreed with Lukashenko that we would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus without violating the nonproliferation regime,” Tass quoted Putin. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. The visit will be Grossi’s second to the plant, Reuters reports. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. “Last night the Russian army attacked a ‘point of invincibility’ in the Donetsk region’s Kostiantynivka. Today’s target for Russian artillery is a humanitarian aid delivery point in Kherson. “Two people were injured in enemy shelling, a 41-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man,” Prokudin added. The time in Kyiv is 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s news so far: The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war against Ukraine. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. The seven-month battle for Bakhmut, where Russian forces have closed in on three sides, is the longest clash of the war, with Russia deploying regular soldiers and fighters of the mercenary Wagner group. Here are some of the latest images coming through from Ukraine: More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. Prigozhin emerged from the shadows and recruited thousands of men from prisons, offering them the chance of freedom in return for serving in some of the most dangerous battles in Ukraine. “At the present time, more than 5,000 people have been released on pardon after completing their contracts with Wagner,” Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in an audio clip posted on Telegram. Prigozhin said just 0.31% of those pardoned after Wagner service had gone on to commit crime, a figure he said was 10-20 times less than the standard indicators. Prigozhin, sometimes called “Putin’s Chef” for his sprawling catering businesses, is the most powerful of a group of Putin allies who now control what are essentially private armies that recruit top military officers, former spies and convicts. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. Mahuta’s four-day trip, which began on Wednesday, was the first made by a New Zealand foreign minister to Beijing since 2018. It came at an awkward time, however, given Xi’s visit in the same week to give Putin a diplomatic boost after the international criminal court said it was seeking to put him on trial for alleged war crimes. On the Ukraine war, Mahuta reiterated her government’s condemnation of Moscow’s “illegal invasion”. Spring has arrived in Ukraine – with late March temperatures an unreasonably high 17C (63F) along much of the frontline in the east. It means it is possible to declare, definitively, that the Russian campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid has failed, and whatever happens next in the war, its people will not be frozen out of their homes, as was once feared when the cynical bombing campaign began on 10 October. The reality, of course, was the missile strikes on key infrastructure had been largely abandoned at the end of January, with Russian missile stocks at 10-15% of prewar levels, according to Ukrainian estimates. Moscow’s tactics are changing: Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Kyiv’s military intelligence, said in a TV interview that it appeared military fuel and “logistics systems” were now being targeted. There has been no shortage of bombing and fighting during the long winter, but in another sense little has happened. The battle for the small Donbas city of Bakhmut rages, as it has since last May, but in recent weeks Ukraine’s forces have been pushed back north and south of the city, leaving the urban centre increasingly isolated, its supply roads dangerously exposed. Drone footage depicts a battered urban landscape, although many buildings are still standing and troops are able to shelter in basements. As the weather turns, so too does talk of a Ukrainian counterattack. Kyiv’s forces are gradually taking delivery of previously promised western tanks, fighting vehicles and other munitions, and some of them have been freshly trained in Britain, Germany or Poland. But the country’s second most important commander, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, surprised most observers when he suggested, on Thursday, that the place for a counterstrike could be in or around Bakhmut itself. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. “It is necessary to work out amendments to legislation prohibiting any activity of the ICC on the territory of our country,” Volodin said in a Telegram post, Reuters reported. Volodin said the US had legislated to prevent its citizens ever being tried by The Hague court and that Russia should continue that work. Any assistance or support for the ICC inside Russia, he said, should be punishable under law. The ICC issued an arrest warrant earlier this month accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bears individual criminal responsibility. Russian officials have cautioned that any attempt to arrest Putin, Russia’s leader since the last day of 1999, would amount to a declaration of war. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for President Vladimir Putin on a wanted list for criminal suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. On Friday, Russian news outlets and an AP reporter discovered Gallyamov listed in the interior ministry’s database. His entry said he was wanted “in relation to a criminal code article” but did not include the law he was accused of breaking. Russia’s justice ministry added Gallyamov last month to its register of foreign agents, a designation that brings additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations aimed at undermining the recipient’s credibility. The ministry said Gallyamov “distributed materials created by foreign agents to an unlimited circle of people, spoke out against the special military operation in Ukraine [and] participated as an expert and respondent on information platforms provided by foreign structures”. Gallyamov told AP on Friday that he learned he was on a wanted list from the media. No law enforcement agency had been in touch, so he didn’t know what charge he faced in Russia. He said in a phone interview: I presume that formally it’s the offence of discrediting the army. It is being used against anyone who refuses to amplify the Kremlin’s playbook and tries to conduct an objective, impartial analysis of what’s going on. Gallyamov described the move against him as part of the Russian government’s “intimidation strategy”. Russia’s assault on the fiercely contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. It said in its latest intelligence update: This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force. Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence. The ministry said Russia’s situation had likely been worsened by “tensions between the Russian ministry of defence and Wagner Group, both of whom contribute troops in the sector”. The battle over Bakhmut has been the longest and bloodiest of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The UK ministry said Russia had probably shifted its operational focus towards Avdiivka, south of Bakhmut, and to the Kremina-Svatove sector in the north – “areas where Russia likely only aspires to stabilise its frontline”. This suggests an overall return to a more defensive operational design after inconclusive results from its attempts to conduct a general offensive since January 2023. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reports that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. There, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, professed friendship and pledged closer ties as Russia struggles in its war against Ukraine. At a joint news conference with Trudeau, Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China has not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Biden said the US had expanded alliances including with Nato, the G7, South Korea and the Quad nations of the US, Australia, India and Japan. We have significantly expanded our alliances. Tell me how in fact you see a circumstance where China has made a significant commitment to Russia. What commitment can they make? Addressing Canada’s parliament, Biden said that, as Nato members, the two countries would “defend every inch of Nato territory”. Trudeau told the news conference that Ukraine was a top issue: Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The leaders of the US and Canada, Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau, have met in Ottawa and reaffirmed their “steadfast support” for Ukraine just days after the Russian and Chinese presidents held their summit in Moscow. Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China had not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Trudeau said: “Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion.” Meanwhile, Russia’s assault on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK Ministry’s of Defence says. “This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing. “Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence.” More on both of those stories shortly. In other key developments just after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded from long-range Russian bombardments in several parts of Ukraine on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s powerful security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. The US president, Joe Biden, said he believed China had not yet sent arms to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “I’ve been hearing now for the past three months China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia ... They haven’t yet,” he told a news conference on Friday. “Doesn’t mean they won’t, but they haven’t yet.” Ukraine claimed Russian forces were “running out of steam” in Bakhmut and its commanders have started to raise the prospect of an unlikely turnaround in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city. Three women were among at least five people killed after a Russian missile struck one of the “invincibility points” providing refuge and basic services for Ukrainian civilians in the eastern city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, local officials said. The Russians attacked overnight on Thursday with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, prosecutors said Air force commanders from Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark have agreed to create a unified Nordic air defence aimed at countering the rising threat from Russia, they said. The intention is to be able to operate jointly based on already known ways of operating under Nato, according to statements by the four countries’ armed forces. The Danish air force commander, Major General Jan Dam, said: “Our combined fleet can be compared to a large European country.” About 10,000 civilians, many of them elderly and with disabilities, are living in “very dire conditions” in and around Bakhmut, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Several thousand civilians were estimated to remain in the city itself and be “spending almost the entire days in intense shelling in the shelters”, the ICRC’s Umar Khan said. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said the “friendship” between China and Russia has limits, and that Europe should welcome any attempts by Beijing to distance itself from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. He said China “has not crossed any red lines for us”, adding that Beijing’s proposals to end the war showed it did not want to fully align with Russia. The bodies of 83 Ukrainian soldiers killed fighting in the war have been returned from the Russian side, a Ukrainian official said. Separately, Kyiv said it handed over an undisclosed number of seriously wounded Russian soldiers. Seven Ukrainian children have been reunited with their families after being forcibly taken to Russian-occupied Crimea, the Kherson regional military administration said. The security situation around the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv will have to improve before its ports can be included in a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain, a senior Ukrainian official has said. The deal was extended this month, but Kyiv and Moscow differ over how long the extension will last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/07/nsw-heatwave-drives-highest-demand-for-power-in-three-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T05:46:45Z","webTitle":"NSW heatwave drives highest demand for power in three years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/nsw-heatwave-drives-highest-demand-for-power-in-three-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/nsw-heatwave-drives-highest-demand-for-power-in-three-years","fields":{"bodyText":"The autumnal heatwave in New South Wales has produced a new record for electricity demand in March, with residents making the biggest demand on the grid in more than three years. NSW residents required 13,136 megawatts as Sydney recorded its hottest day in more than two years and the third highest on record for March. The low-intensity heatwave is expected to continue for Sydney, the Illawarra and Hunter regions until a cool change arrives on Wednesday afternoon. Jonathon Geddes from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said high temperature drove a peak demand at around 6pm Monday. The evening peak was the likely result of the sun going down and rooftop solar coming off the grid at the same time as people came home and wanted to use electricity for cooling and cooking purposes, according to Geddes. “It’s the highest demand we’ve seen in New South Wales since February 2020,” he said. “We have been in La Niña weather pattern for several years.” The national electricity market “held up well”, Geddes said, with enough generation to meet supply and no disruption to energy consumers related to the high demand. The total generation capacity in NSW stood at about 20,000MW, and 60,000MW in the national electricity markets, he said. The all-time record for electricity demand in NSW was 14,744MW in February 2011. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Geddes said peak demand was typically in summer during heatwave periods, as cooling required more energy than heating, resulting in more minimum-demand days in winter, spring and autumn. Jonathan How, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said because a heatwave was a combination of high daytime temperatures staying warm overnight, the body was not able to recover properly and that could pose a health risk. The conditions were often especially difficult for elderly Australians and those with medical conditions, How said. On Tuesday, temperatures reached 34C in the Sydney CBD and 36C at the airport at 2.30pm, with temperatures still rising. How said the hottest place in NSW on Tuesday was Williamtown in Newcastle, which reached 37.7C. More than 30 fires were burning in the state on Tuesday, 10 of which were yet to be brought under control. Prof Ollie Jay, director of the heat and health incubator at the University of Sydney, said exposure to extreme heat events that lasted for several days could cause heat-related illnesses, from heat exhaustion to heatstroke. People with heart disease were also susceptible, Jay said, because one of the first ways the human body responded to heat was to redistribute blood towards the skin. This meant the heart had to beat more often to stop blood pressure from dropping. People with kidney problems could also be more vulnerable during heat events due to dehydration caused by sweating, he said. Jay said most Australians coped with the heat by using air-conditioning. Older Australians were vulnerable as they might not have air-conditioning or use it due to a spike in electricity costs, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T07:15:02Z","webTitle":"Bigger than Beckham: Messi has the power to realise soccer’s potential in the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","fields":{"bodyText":"Lionel Messi is taking his talents to South Beach – or, more accurately, Fort Lauderdale. That’s where he will play this summer after it was confirmed Inter Miami have won the race to sign arguably the greatest player of all time. It is the biggest transfer in Major League Soccer history. Bigger even than David Beckham’s move to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. Beckham changed the soccer landscape in the US. His move to the Galaxy didn’t just push MLS into the American mainstream, it made the league a viable destination for some of the sport’s most recognisable names, and they don’t come more recognisable than Messi. Beckham, an Inter Miami co-owner, has brought things full circle by getting the GOAT to MLS. Inter Miami chased Messi for years. When the franchise was awarded an MLS expansion spot in 2018, the Argentinian congratulated Beckham. “Who knows, maybe in a few years you can give me a ring,” he said in a social media video. When Messi left Barcelona in 2021, Inter Miami were quickly on the phone to make an offer, although he chose Paris Saint-Germain, where Beckham also once played. Earlier this year, Beckham attended a PSG training session and was pictured with Messi – a move to Inter Miami was surely mentioned. Inter Miami were built around the idea Messi would one day join the club. Xavi Asensi was hired from Barcelona as the club’s chief business officer while Victor Oliver, another former Barça executive, was named a senior vice-president. Recent reports suggest the former Argentina and Barcelona coach Tata Martino has been approached about the club’s managerial vacancy. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez have also been linked with a move to Inter Miami, who may end up looking like a Messi And Friends XI. On the pitch, Inter Miami are in bad shape. At PSG Messi lined up alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, in Miami he will be a teammate of Robert Taylor, once of Lincoln City. Messi may have to win games on his own to push his team up the table: they are bottom of the Eastern Conference and on a run of five straight league defeats. There are also questions over whether Inter Miami’s temporary 18,000-capacity DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale will be suitable for the coming circus. Could the much larger Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, host some Inter Miami matches to sell more tickets? The appetite certainly appears to be there: Forbes reported that the cheapest tickets on resale websites for Messi’s possible home debut in August are exchanging hands for more than $500. Messi’s signing is about much more than just Inter Miami though. MLS has pulled all sorts of levers to make a deal for the World Cup winner possible because it believes he will kickstart a new phase of growth for the league, just as Beckham did 16 years ago. MLS has generally moved beyond its previous dependence on aging stars to attract new fans, but Messi is different – he can move the needle like nobody else. Beckham changed the league. MLS grew from 13 teams at the time of his signing to the current number of 29 – the league’s 30th franchise will join in 2025. Beckham sold 300,000 LA Galaxy jerseys a season during his five-and-a-half years at the club. He appeared on late-night talkshows and in adverts with NFL stars. Without the Englishman’s star power, MLS would look very different. With the 2026 World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico, on the horizon, and with Messi now an MLS player, the drive for growth in soccer in the US will reach new levels over the next three years. If MLS is to become one of the strongest leagues in the world, this period will be crucial. The allure of Miami itself should not be ignored. He already owns property there and his family are said to enjoy the city, which has a large Spanish-speaking population: language barriers should not be a problem for the Messis. The governing body of Argentinian soccer also plans to build a facility in Miami, and more and more South Americans are joining MLS. It’s possible Apple factored this, and the signing of Messi, into its decision to sign a record-breaking $2.5bn broadcast contract with MLS last year. Messi will reportedly receive a percentage of new MLS Season Pass subscriptions. A documentary series on the 35-year-old has already been ordered. AppleTV+ will essentially become MessiTV+. A percentage of Adidas jersey sales is also believed to be included in the unprecedented commercial package put together by MLS for Messi. The Argentinian’s face is already plastered on billboards around the world, but now it will be used to sell MLS – and the player himself appears to be banking on his own celebrity to make his time in the league as lucrative as possible. Never before has MLS given up so much to sign a player. Beckham had the chance to purchase a franchise for just $25m as part of his LA Galaxy contract, with the clause activated to create Inter Miami, but Messi’s overall package could be worth a lot more. “We have been pretty effective at coming up with clever ways to sign players for our clubs in the right market,” said MLS commissioner Don Garber earlier this year, hinting at the creativity used to draw up Messi’s deal. It will be worth it if Messi makes the impact so many expect him to. “I think of him as someone who crosses so many barriers that he can be bigger than any athlete of any sport that has ever played here in the United States,” said Garber. If Beckham’s move to MLS highlighted the potential of the league and soccer in the US, Messi could be the one who fully realises it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-13T11:24:50Z","webTitle":"Young Thais look to Pita Limjaroenrat to bust military-royalist grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","fields":{"bodyText":"When Pita Limjaroenrat took to the stage for his final big campaign event before Thailand’s elections, the cheers and screams were deafening. “Our time has come,” he told crowds of mostly young supporters in a packed stadium in Bangkok. Pita’s Move Forward party has built a large and loyal support base among young Thais who are fed up with the political status quo. At rallies, he is met with long lines of students and young people queueing for selfies. On TikTok, fans post images of themselves with a special filter that displays his face smiling and lurking in the background. Pita has promised to push military generals back to the barracks – a pledge that resonates with young people who have already lived through two military coups, in 2006 and 2014. He has also promised to break up powerful monopolies that dominate the Thai economy, and reform the lèse-majesté law, under which criticism of the monarchy can be punished with up to 15 years in prison. Move Forward is the only party to make a clear commitment to reform the law; conservative parties all fiercely oppose doing so. “The wind of change has been blowing,” Pita said at the rally on Friday night, a final push before Sunday’s election. “What we need to carefully and maturely ask ourselves is, is Thai society building a wall, or a wind turbine?” In 2020, mass youth-led protests shocked the establishment by calling for changes to the military and curbs on the wealth and influence of Thailand’s monarchy, an institution previously seen as untouchable. More than 240 people have since been charged with lèse-majesté – including former protesters who are now running as Move Forward candidates. Speaking on Friday night, Pita referred to a high-profile case involving a 15-year-old girl who was held for more than 40 days in pre-trial detention after she was accused of criticising the monarchy. A sensible debate was needed, he said. Pita, 42, grew up in a political family. His father, Pongsak Limjaroenrat, was an adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture, and his uncle, Padung Limcharoenrat, was a close aide of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. It was time spent studying in New Zealand as a teenager that truly sparked his love for politics, however. “I got shipped to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand and there were three channels back then. Either you watch Australian soap operas, or you watch the debates in parliament,” he told the Thai YouTube programme Aim Hour. He began to listen to the then New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger’s speeches as he did his homework. Pita graduated from Thammasat University in Bangkok, before studying for a master’s degree in public policy at Harvard University, and an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the executive director of Grab Thailand, a ride-hailing and food delivery app, before joining politics. He told the Guardian that Thailand had experienced a lost decade under Prayuth Chan-ocha, the incumbent prime minister who first took power in a coup in 2014. “Democratic institutions and norms have been broken,” he said, adding that the economy was “in a tailspin”. Thailand’s economy had slumped compared with its neighbours in south-east Asia. Pita has been praised for his firm but polite debating style, and he has ranked well in polling for Thailand’s preferred prime minister. But Move Forward has also made powerful enemies by promising to make changes to the conservative military-royalist establishment. Pheu Thai, an opposition party which is projected to win the most seats, may be deterred from forming an alliance with Pita’s party, fearing that its policies, especially those relating to the monarchy, are too sensitive. Move Forward party’s predecessor, Future Forward, which was also outspoken in calling for change, was closed down in 2020 after a court ruled it had broken funding regulations. Its supporters saw the case as politically motivated, and it was one of the triggers for the 2020 protest movement. Pita said it was unsurprising that some opposed Move Forward’s promise of change. “The definition of change is that some will be gainers, and some will be losers. But 99% will gain from our policies,” he said. Last week, a complaint was filed against Pita, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied any wrongdoing and told the Guardian the case was just “dirty old politics”. “We’re not concerned,” he said. But added: “We’re not reckless as well. We have a strong legal team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-09T05:46:11Z","webTitle":"Australia and New Zealand best placed to survive nuclear apocalypse, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","fields":{"bodyText":"The lucky country can count on one more piece of good fortune, with researchers finding Australia – followed by neighbour New Zealand – best placed to survive a nuclear winter and help reboot a collapsed human civilisation. The study published in the journal Risk Analysis describes Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as the island countries most capable of producing enough food for their populations after an “abrupt sunlight‐reducing catastrophe” such as a nuclear war, super volcano or asteroid strike. There would “likely be pockets of survivors around the planet in even the most severe” scenario, the researchers write – with those in the most resilient nations standing the best chance of avoiding a pre-industrial collapse. The authors compared 38 island countries on 13 factors they said could predict success as a post-apocalyptic survival state, including food production, energy self-sufficiency, manufacturing and the disaster’s effect on climate. Australia and New Zealand – both robust agricultural producers and tucked away from the likely sites of northern hemisphere nuclear fallout – topped the tables, with Australia performing best overall. “Australia’s food supply buffer is gigantic,” the study concludes, “with potential to feed many tens of millions of extra people.” Australia’s relatively good infrastructure, vast energy surplus, high health security and defence budget all aided in pushing it to the top of the table. Australia did have one major factor working against it, however: its relatively close military ties with the UK and US made it more likely to become a target in a nuclear war. In this area, New Zealand displayed some advantages, the authors said, with its longstanding nuclear-free status. Its resilience in the event of an abrupt drop in global temperature prompted by a period of darkness (everywhere in New Zealand is relatively close to the ocean, cushioning it from extreme temperature plunges) would also help. “We have this super efficient food export economy that could feed New Zealanders multiple times over just from exports,” said one of the study’s authors, Prof Nick Wilson from the University of Otago, Wellington. Even in the worst-case scenario – a 61% reduction in crops during a prolonged nuclear winter – New Zealanders would still have enough to eat, he added. Despite New Zealand’s abundance of food and its high ranking on social cohesion metrics, a shutdown of global trade could precipitate social collapse by degrees, Wilson added. “I am concerned about a false security for New Zealand,” Wilson said. The country no longer had any facility refining fuel and is intensely dependent on imports for the diesel, pesticides and machinery needed to sustain its dominant agricultural sector. Other island countries would be able to produce enough food in such a crisis, Wilson and co-author Dr Matt Boyd wrote, but the likely collapse of industry and social cohesion put their resilience in doubt. China, Russia and the United States could see food production fall up to 97% under nuclear winter models and would be forced to rely on new food production technologies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T06:56:45Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Why the nuclear fusion breakthrough doesn’t mean we’re in energy utopia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. You may know nuclear fusion as the power source for Iron Man’s suit, or the basis of the Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor that powers the, er, flux capacitor in Back to the Future. (If so, please stop reading, this is not a newsletter for nerds.) Yesterday, after the news was initially reported by the Financial Times, Joe Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, confirmed a scientific breakthrough at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that’s a very long way from a superhero exoskeleton or a souped-up DeLorean: for the first time, a fusion reaction has produced more energy than it takes in. Which sounds miles better than a time machine, to be honest. Granholm called it “one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century”. In theory, nuclear fusion reactors could one day be a plentiful source of power without any associated carbon emissions or radioactive waste. Climate crisis solved, and we can all get back to obsessing over Harry and Meghan on Netflix instead. Disappointingly, though, it isn’t anything like that simple. Today’s Grinch-like (but also very interesting!) newsletter, with Dr Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London, is about the long distance from a remarkable breakthrough to an energy utopia – and why fusion won’t help us get to net zero. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Asylum | Rishi Sunak has insisted he can clear a backlog of nearly 100,000 asylum claims by the end of next year as part of a five-point plan that includes changes to the law that will criminalise and then remove tens of thousands of people who claimed asylum after travelling to the UK by small boats. Strikes | The standoff between UK ministers, bosses and unions over pay showed no sign of reaching resolution on the first day of four weeks of planned industrial action. Rishi Sunak said that the government would not shift its position on pay ahead of another day of disrupted trains on Wednesday. Strep A | The cost of antibiotics used to strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK in recent weeks, pharmacists have said, with many facing continued difficulties in sourcing supplies. Since mid-September there had been 60 deaths from invasive strep A infections in England, including 13 children. Plastics | Single-use plastic items including cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups are reportedly to be banned in England by the UK government after a consultation. Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, is poised to unveil plans to phase out the items and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. Media | Harry &amp; Meghan, Netflix’s documentary series about Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, racked up more viewing time on the streaming service than any other documentary during its first week, the company said. More than 28m households watched at least part of the series. In depth: ‘Predicting the future is difficult – there are huge hurdles to overcome’ Before we get into the reservations, Dr Michael Bluck wants to be clear about something: the success of the US government’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California in producing a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the first time is remarkable. “This is a very impressive scientific achievement – it’s a really, really hard thing to do,” he said. Ever since the 1950s, scientists have sought to realise the theoretical promise of the same reaction that occurs in the core of the sun. But the old joke about fusion suggests how difficult that has been: it is always, always 30 years away. “These are very bright people doing amazing things,” Bluck said. “It is a sort of holy grail.” *** What is nuclear fusion? Whereas nuclear fission – the process at work in conventional nuclear power plants – generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium, fusion works the other way round. A thermonuclear reaction fuses light elements like hydrogen into heavier ones like helium, thereby generating more energy than it takes to produce. (Nicola Davis explains this in more detail.) That process is known as “ignition”. Beyond the obvious virtue of a net energy yield, “It’s low carbon, it offers baseload [that is, consistent] energy unlike renewables at the moment, and you don’t have to worry about it melting down or producing nuclear waste to the same extent,” Bluck said. “It’s a great vision.” *** What does this announcement mean? There are two approaches to nuclear fusion: call them doughnuts v lasers. Magnetic confinement is the more common and longstanding method: picture, if you can, a doughnut-shaped machine, with nuclear fuel inside it kept afloat by magnetic fields and heated to incredible temperatures while the reaction takes place. The NIF is one of a smaller number of facilities trying something different: inertial confinement. In the pithy summary of White House science chief, Arati Prabhakar, yesterday: “They shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel [hydrogen plasma] and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers.” The pellet, encased in diamond, sits in a tiny gold cylinder. By hitting it with 192 giant lasers for less than 100 trillionths of a second at more than 3 million celsius, scientists at NIF succeeded in producing 3 megajoules of energy from the 2.05 megajoules it took to make the reaction happen. But as good as that sounds, there are very significant barriers to further progress. “It’s important to say that this is not trying to be a fusion reactor, it’s simply trying to make fusion happen,” said Bluck. “But it lacks almost everything that you need to make a viable reactor. “So, OK, the energy put in has resulted in a larger amount of energy coming out – but the big caveat is that it depends where you draw your perimeter: powering the lasers themselves required way more energy. You have to draw a slightly artificial dotted line around the vessel to say there’s been a gain.” The lasers may emit 2.05 megajoules, but they took about 500 megajoules of energy to power, though defenders of the experiment say that they are not optimally efficient and can be significantly improved. “There’s also the fact that you would need the reaction to happen much more often,” he went on. At the moment, the NIF manages it about ten times a week. “You need it many times a second.” As well as all that, the energy produced in the NIF experiment is in the form of “high speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating – none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We’ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.” That’s very difficult to do without overheating the lasers that make the reaction happen in the first place. “And that programme of work has not even been thought about yet.” Magnetic confinement – the doughnut option – may not have reached the more-out-than-in milestone yet. “But they have been thinking about the real world stuff for many years. They’ve sort of” – you can hear the pain of this simplification in Bluck’s voice as he speaks – “solved the physics issues, and now they’re looking squarely at the engineering issues.” *** So does this news mean nuclear fusion plants are closer? Again, sort of: something with a proven concept is closer than something without one. (Arthur Turrell argues for the importance of that step.) Yesterday, Jennifer Granholm said that Joe Biden had set a target of “a commercial fusion reactor within 10 years”. What’s possible? “Predicting the future is difficult,” allowed Bluck. “But I think I’m being optimistic in saying 50 years for inertial confinement being in practical use – it’s between 50 years and never. There are huge hurdles to overcome.” Kim Budil of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that “a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant”. Could magnetic confinement work sooner? “I think that’s ambitious, too,” said Bluck. “A demonstrator by 2050 – OK, that could be possible. But that doesn’t mean it’s cost effective to scale up.” *** But can it help reach net zero? Some advocates of fusion would say that Bluck is being too pessimistic – but even in best case scenarios, it is hard to see fusion as a useful part of the changes needed to make net zero a reality. It is cumulative emissions that matter to avoiding the worst impact of the climate crisis, and so even if fusion plants are online at scale by 2050, that is too late. Nonetheless, investors in fusion – like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel – are persuaded of its revolutionary potential. “There is a degree of utopian zeal,” said Bluck. “You’re not a billionaire worthy of the name unless you’re investing in ambitious devices. What it will mean for getting to net zero by 2050 is realistically nothing. I do worry sometimes that it can suck the air out of other more viable solutions.” *** So is there any point in pursuing fusion power? Absolutely! For one thing, Bluck might be wrong: “There might be that significant step forwards that changes things suddenly. But we should be careful not to overestimate that possibility.” Still, nuclear fusion doesn’t have to be about solving the climate crisis to be worthwhile. The more realistic role for fusion, Thomas Nicholas writes in this 2019 piece for the Conversation, is “as an energy source in a post carbon society”. And so long as it doesn’t become an excuse for ignoring the urgency of the only realistic solution to the climate crisis, a rapid transition to renewables, it’s not like it presents much competition for funding: the total investment in private companies working on fusion ever is about $4.8bn, the Fusion Industry Association says. In comparison, clean energy investment in 2022 totalled $1.4tn, of which $472bn went on renewable power. “None of this means fusion doesn’t have potential,” Bluck said. “But you have to be able to say what you’re going to do in between.” Pondering the holy grail, he added: “I don’t think they ever found it, did they?” What else we’ve been reading Andrew Gregory and Denis Campbell spent 33 hours in an NHS hospital, and their findings unveiled just how deep the crisis in the health service has gotten.

The position, restated by Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil, on Tuesday, was seized on by the Coalition, which claimed it sent a “confusing signal” for Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines. Since the deal was announced earlier in March, the Albanese government has faced criticism from former prime ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, and former Labor ministers Doug Cameron, Gareth Evans, Kim Carr and Bob Carr. The Labor caucus has united behind the government’s position, with only MP Josh Wilson expressing public concerns, despite many unions opposing the nuclear submarine acquisition. Asked if she would have preferred the purchase of conventional submarines, O’Neil told the National Press Club that the ACTU had “a longstanding policy of opposition to nuclear power, nuclear waste and proliferation”. “We also have a longstanding policy position that supports a nuclear-free defence policy. “These are not positions that have been developed in the last weeks and months. They are decades long and our position hasn’t changed.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O’Neil said although the Aukus purchase of Virginia class and SSN Aukus class submarines was a “new announcement”, the ACTU’s had been “clear about these issues”. “The detail of the announcement that’s been made is something that we will bring our affiliates together to discuss over the coming months and we will want more detail from the government as well.” O’Neil’s comments suggest the ACTU could revisit its policy rather than seek to persuade Labor to abandon the nuclear submarine acquisition. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, said the Coalition had offered bipartisan defence on Aukus “because we know that it is a multigenerational, nation-building project that demands support from governments around the nation, industry and the private sector”. “For Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines sends a confusing signal to the Australian people,” he said in a statement. “It’s particularly damaging when the government has clearly articulated our strategic need for submarines and has promised the creation of 20,000 local jobs.” Hastie called on the ACTU to “adapt, as our strategic circumstances now demand”. “The ACTU should drop its archaic last-century stance on nuclear power, and work on growing Australian industry in the national interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-20T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Parties, power, racing: meet Ovo’s Stephen Fitzpatrick, the man who would be Richard Branson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","fields":{"bodyText":"Pink flamingos once strolled around a rooftop garden set high above the traffic of Kensington High Street in west London, where stars including Madonna and George Harrison rubbed shoulders with the business elite. The exclusive party venue was owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin for 37 years before closing in 2018 after struggling to make a profit. Now, an unlikely figure is trying to resurrect Kensington Roof Gardens with a plan to reopen it as a private members’ club. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of Britain’s fourth-biggest gas and electricity supplier, Ovo Energy, has chosen an awkward time to reopen the luxury venue, just as millions of households struggle amid an energy crisis that has stretched their finances to the limit with soaring utility bills. But Fitzpatrick loves the high life: the serial entrepreneur has taken much inspiration from the bearded billionaire and his Virgin Group. He has dabbled in everything from energy and software to premium rum. His most eyecatching venture – rescuing the Manor Racing Formula One team in 2015 and reportedly pumping in £30m – ended with the business falling into administration in 2017, having secured a solitary point. Branson had spearheaded the same team, then branded Virgin Racing, eight years earlier. Fitzpatrick also shares Branson’s love of aviation and bold new ventures, and has even modelled the structure of his group on the one used by Britain’s best-known entrepreneur. “We have followed the Virgin story very closely,” he said in 2016. From a cluster of gleaming properties a short walk from the roof gardens, he runs the ventures that have amassed him a fortune estimated at £2.2bn. Ovo is now even reportedly considering another blockbuster acquisition, of struggling Shell Energy’s 1.4 million customers. But the former Tory donor, whose stake in Ovo is worth an estimated £2bn, faces a series of challenges to keep his ventures on track. Sources claim Fitzpatrick continues to take a close interest in politics too, although neither he nor his firms have made a political donation since the £185,000 handed to the Conservative party in 2019, when Labour was threatening to renationalise energy companies. Meanwhile, his Marmite personality has made him a divisive figure among peers and colleagues. To some, he is an ambitious trailblazer, to others a flashy hard-driver intent on being seen as a tech visionary but with a patchy record. A detailed analysis of Fitzpatrick’s ventures reveals he has quietly transferred control of Ovo during the energy crisis, has taken a hit to his wealth from his flying taxis venture and shut down a project designed to share his business acumen with other companies. He declined to comment for this article. The energy egg hatches The Northern Irishman, 45, founded Ovo in the teeth of the financial crisis in 2009. The Edinburgh University graduate had set up a free property listings newspaper and website in Scotland in 2001 but shut the business down after realising its limitations. A stint in the City followed, as a trader at Société Générale and JP Morgan, before he launched the energy supplier with his wife, Sophy, using £350,000 of savings. Ovo – from the Latin for egg – grew, rapidly amassing more than 1,000 employees in London and Bristol as a result of its eyecatching marketing and green energy tariffs. Fitzpatrick spent Ovo’s formative years bemoaning the dominance of “legacy” suppliers such as British Gas, accusing them of poor service and ripping off loyal customers. “He really was Mr Angry in the early years,” recalls one former insider at the energy regulator, Ofgem. “He was constantly accusing us and the government of being ineffectual and protecting the existing big guys. He took himself very seriously.” The government later intervened, introducing the Ofgem price cap in 2019, designed to protect consumers who did not switch from being overcharged. It would later contribute to almost 30 suppliers collapsing as gas prices soared. Meanwhile, Ovo was on the acquisition trail, first taking over rival Spark Energy in 2018, and then, on the eve of the pandemic, completing a transformative deal – snapping up the retail arm of energy and cables titan SSE for £500m after its merger with npower collapsed. The deal saw Ovo take its customer base from 1.5 million to almost 5 million. “He went from David to Goliath with one deal,” says one industry chief executive. (Shortly before this, in early 2020, Ovo had also been fined nearly £9m for sending inaccurate bills for three years.) That deal thrust Fitzpatrick and his swollen energy empire into the spotlight just as the pandemic hit, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 then sending bills rocketing. Ovo faced questions over taking £17m in furlough money after making £40m of payments and loans to other Fitzpatrick companies, and MPs called on Ovo to be “transparent about its books”. Fitzpatrick was criticised for living in a £3.2m Cotswolds mansion while Ovo encouraged struggling consumers to “cuddle your pets” to keep warm. Then Ovo considered gazumping Octopus’s acquisition of bust supplier Bulb and was accused of making further billing errors. Ovo responded by scaling down, cutting a quarter of its 6,200 workforce early last year and later selling its telecoms and revenue protection businesses. At the same time, operations chief Raman Bhatia was promoted to run its retail arm, Fitzpatrick having taken a step back from Ovo’s day-to-day running. ‘Uncertainty’ Last year, it emerged Ovo’s parent company, Imagination Industries, had made £27m in loans to Fitzpatrick and its only other director – Ovo’s finance chief, Vincent Casey. In the same accounts, auditor PwC said there was “material uncertainty” over Imagination’s ability to continue as a going concern. It said the group was “exposed to short-term volatility in wholesale commodity prices and credit losses caused by the UK cost of living crisis” and said the group was “forecasting to breach financial covenants with trading creditors”. In 2013, Fitzpatrick faced scrutiny over taking £2m out of then-lossmaking Ovo to fund the purchase of a house in the Cotswolds. Imagination Industries also handed a £10m interest-free loan to his Manor Formula One team in 2015. Customers’ credit balances on their energy accounts, which are typically built up in the summer and run down in the winter, have also been a source of controversy. Ofgem has said it asked Ovo to stop using customer credit balances as working capital in “about 2015, 2016”. It is understood the regulator had concerns that Fitzpatrick was using customer money to fund Manor. Fitzpatrick has said there was “absolutely no financial link” between Ovo and Manor. A row over the issue resurfaced last year, as Ofgem ruled against ringfencing credit balances despite earlier accusing unnamed firms of using customer money “like an interest-free company credit card”. Sources said Ovo had resisted proposals to ringfence customer deposits last year. Research last month showed energy suppliers were hoarding nearly £7bn of customers’ money despite the cost of living crisis. In February, Ofgem said Ovo was among four suppliers it was engaging with to “secure improvements or adequate reassurance of compliance” on direct debit levels. Ovo has previously declined to disclose how much customer money it holds, or the average credit balance. However, it is understood Ovo has argued it does not use credit balances to fund growth and that, on average, customers owe it more money than Ovo owes to them during each year. A shift in control Since 2014, Fitzpatrick has modelled Ovo’s corporate structure on Branson’s Virgin, with a holding company – Imagination – collecting royalties from its public brand. Company filings now show that control of Ovo switched from Imagination to another business, Energy Transition Holdings (ETH), in late March; customers and the media were not proactively informed of this at the time. Imagination is controlled by Fitzpatrick, with Casey the only other director. ETH is another Fitzpatrick vehicle, with directors which mirror Ovo’s: namely Fitzpatrick, Casey, chair Stephen Murphy and director Go Muromoto, a representative of Mitsubishi, which took a 20% stake in Ovo, valuing the business at £1bn, in 2019. It is now valued at £3bn. They are joined on both boards by two directors from private equity outfit Mayfair Equity Partners, which bought a stake for £31m in 2015. It is understood the change in control was enacted to separate Ovo, which also includes prepay specialist Boost Energy, from the rest of Fitzpatrick’s interests, but the low-key nature of the move could raise further questions over the level of transparency from a company upon which millions of people rely for an essential service. Imagination’s latest accounts showed that in 2021 it notched up £4.5bn of revenues and profits of £377m – a one-off gain as the firm cashed in £422m of energy contracts. The results were in stark contrast with the previous three years, during which more than £300m of losses were racked up. Since its inception in 2009, Imagination has posted annual pre-tax profits four times and losses nine times, with £402m of cumulative profits and £406.6m in losses. Royalties paid from Ovo to Imagination were £21m in 2021, and Ovo then owed Imagination £15m. More recently, the government has handed Ovo and its competitors funds to cut bills after the Ukraine war pushed up costs, following pleas by Fitzpatrick and peers for state intervention. As Ovo runs the rule over Shell Energy, some are worried about its capacity to digest another large supplier. Ovo already has 13.3% of Britain’s domestic electricity market and 11.2% of the gas market. Adding Shell would give it market shares of about 18% and 16% respectively. “Transparency and accountability are so important in energy after the chaos caused by so many suppliers going bust,” says Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition. “Many were private companies where the public had little visibility of their financial performance. This highlights the risk of concentrating control of many customers with one supplier, as we saw with Bulb. If Ovo does buy Shell Energy’s customers, more control will be in the hands of one supplier, reducing choice and potentially adding even more risk to Britain’s already broken energy system.” Ovo faces another challenge: customers of the SSE Energy Services (SES) brand will be moved under the Ovo tag by January 2024 when a brand licence agreement ends. Customers will hope the transition is smooth after recently ranking SES the worst energy supplier. Last week, Ovo Energy and Good Energy were ordered to pay £4m after overcharging thousands of households on their bills by breaching the energy price cap. On the runway Despite his ever-growing energy empire, one of Fitzpatrick’s main focuses in recent years has been Vertical Aerospace, the flying taxis firm he created in 2016. He has an office at the top of a block on Notting Hill Gate, near Ovo’s London home and Kensington Roof Gardens, but Vertical is primarily run out of Bristol, its shares are traded in New York and it is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Vertical hopes to revolutionise the world of travel, allowing short trips in light aircraft with eight propellers and a cruise speed of 150mph. As its name suggests, they would be able to take off vertically and land in confined spaces in cities. Vertical aims to get its VX4 model into service by 2025. The company received a £14m grant from the UK’s publicly funded Aerospace Technology Institute this year. It even has the backing of Branson: in 2021 his Virgin Atlantic took out an option to buy 150 VX4s, aiming to provide a UK network of Virgin-branded taxis. Fitzpatrick said the deal “unites two entrepreneurial organisations who share the same passion for innovation and best-in-class partnerships”. But despite the hype, the company has been one of several UK businesses to suffer amid the US tech rout. Vertical floated with a valuation of $2.2bn, swelling Fitzpatrick’s paper fortune by about $800m. But the stock is down more than 80% since its debut in late 2021. Fitzpatrick has witnessed his near 70% stake crumble by about $500m, and the company is now valued at just over $400m (£320m). Electric flying taxis have long been touted as a neat solution for solving traffic problems in gridlocked cities looking to cut their carbon footprint and pollution. However, doubts over their feasibility have weighed on investors’ nerves, despite a order book of about 1,400 aircraft. The company has likened its difficulties to the doubts around Tesla in its early days, and hopes more customers will follow American Airlines in agreeing to make pre-delivery payments for aircraft to ensure priority orders. It has said as “an early-stage company with a history of losses, we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses in the foreseeable future”. Software glitches In line with several energy upstarts, Fitzpatrick has long tried to cultivate an image of Ovo as more of a digital enterprise than a traditional energy supplier. One senior industry executive says he has always hoped “to position Ovo as a tech company and himself the leader of a new generation of energy companies. He seems monomaniacal [in that mission]”. In 2019, he formed a “grid technology” business, Kaluza, within Ovo, offering software handling tasks ranging from billing to smart electric vehicle charging. It lists Nissan, EDF and BP among its customers. But reality has yet to match the ambition. Bosses at the platform, which is named after German mathematician Theodor Kaluza and has now been spun out of Ovo, kicked off talks for a new round of funding late last year, but no fresh funds have been announced. Accounts show it made a loss of £14.6m in 2021. Auditors at PwC said the firm was reliant on Ovo for funding and warned over uncertainties around wholesale energy prices and the cost of living crisis. Fitzpatrick also launched a remote-working software business aimed at helping organisations prioritise their workloads. He founded Just3Things with Kim Atherton, who was the chief people officer at Ovo, in 2018, spinning out the app in 2020 as the pandemic spurred a surge in remote working. Just3Things has been quietly mothballed, and Atherton’s LinkedIn page says she left it in December. She is now an occupational psychologist and declined to comment. Then there is the rum brand, Duppy Share, that Fitzpatrick has invested in alongside ex-footballer Ian Wright and rapper Kano. There is also Akili Partners, a management consultancy dissolved this year; as at the end of 2021, Akili owed Imagination a loan of £941,000. Another interest, Imagination Industries Incubator, owed £9.8m in loans to its parent, Imagination Industries, in 2021. When will the party start? None of this appears to have deterred Fitzpatrick from his latest racy project. He took a 15-year lease on Kensington Roof Gardens in the early months of the pandemic, in July 2020, and there is speculation it will relaunch this summer. The striking venue opened in 1938 and has Grade II-listed status. Plans submitted to the council show Fitzpatrick wants to attract chefs from around the globe to four new restaurants but also create the “antithesis of an ostentatious Mayfair private members’ club”. Kensington Roof Gardens is owned by Imagination and accounts show it provided a £3.75m loan to the gardens in 2021, with an interest charge of £139,000. At the end of that year, the venture owed £4.3m. The Mail on Sunday reported that local residents have resisted plans for parties until 3am and complained that guests may be able to peer into their properties from the gardens. Fitzpatrick will hope that, when the champagne cork finally pops on its opening, his other ventures have not already left him nursing a hangover."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/07/penny-wong-overruled-department-by-sending-observer-to-anti-nuclear-treaty-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T14:00:49Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong overruled department by sending observer to anti-nuclear treaty meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/penny-wong-overruled-department-by-sending-observer-to-anti-nuclear-treaty-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/07/penny-wong-overruled-department-by-sending-observer-to-anti-nuclear-treaty-meeting","fields":{"bodyText":"Penny Wong overruled her department and insisted on sending an observer to the first meeting of countries that support a landmark United Nations treaty banning nuclear weapons, new documents reveal. A trove of documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws shows nervous officials warned the foreign minister of “significant” risks if Australia went to the gathering in Vienna shortly after last year’s election. Those risks included that “Australia’s attendance could be misinterpreted as a first step” in actually joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which is opposed by the United States and other nuclear weapons states. Despite Anthony Albanese championing the treaty prior to forming government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also issued a general warning that joining the agreement “could carry risks for our strategic interests”. The relatively new treaty imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. It now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and is strongly backed by neighbours such as Indonesia and New Zealand. Australia has not yet taken steps to join the treaty, and continues to consider its position. The Labor party committed to sign and ratify the treaty after considering a range of factors that appear to be high hurdles to pass. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But anti-nuclear weapons campaigners were heartened by the decision to send government backbencher Susan Templeman to the Vienna meeting in June. Australia followed that up by shifting its position at a UN committee in October to “abstain” after five years of actively opposing the treaty under the Coalition. The newly released documents show Dfat formally recommended against sending an observer to the first meeting of TPNW members. Officials conceded that attending would “attract praise from its proponents” and “may help to offset criticism … about Australia’s commitment to the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime”. “However, in light of the ALP’s pre-election position on TPNW, Australia’s attendance as an observer could be misinterpreted as a first step in acceding to the treaty,” the submission to Wong in June said. The department added that if the minister decided to send an observer anyway, “a concerted diplomatic effort will be required to mitigate the risks” and to “minimise the significance of the decision” to attend. Wong circled “not agreed” to the main recommendation and asked for further advice about the impact of sending a backbench MP. Dfat then provided a new submission saying that if Australia was the only country to send a parliamentarian as an observer “we will need to manage potential perceptions” and “shape the narrative”. “Public messaging will be necessary in light of strong domestic and international interest,” it said in an attached strategy document. “Key to any messaging … will be to highlight that no decision has been made on our broader approach to the Treaty.” Gem Romuld, the Australian director of the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said it was “time for Australia to dispense with the dangerous, outdated notion that nuclear weapons bring security”. “It’s clear that certain officials at the foreign ministry are intent on maintaining the previous government’s unprincipled position on this treaty,” Romuld said. “We’re pleased that minister Wong has insisted on taking a new direction.” Labor’s national platform in 2021 included conditions for supporting the treaty, including working for universal support and effective verification and enforcement. Wong’s spokesperson said the government was “engaging constructively to identify realistic pathways for nuclear disarmament” and that was why the minister had signed off on Templeman’s attendance as an observer. “The government will consider the TPNW systematically and methodically as a part of our ambitious agenda to advance nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament,” the spokesperson said. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the TPNW “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. That was a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. Wong’s spokesperson said there were “a number of complex issues to be considered” and Australia would “engage closely with our international partners – including the United States – as part of this process”. “The government has reaffirmed that the US alliance remains central to Australia’s national security and strategic policy,” the spokesperson said. The documents also reveal Dfat officials warned in August against uniting with other countries to sign a statement of concern about the humanitarian impacts of nuclear weapons. The submission to Wong said: “While this might provide an opportunity to counter the narrative that concern for humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons must equate to support for the TPNW, the statement includes wording that nuclear weapons are never to be used again, ‘under any circumstances’. It is unbalanced.” Dfat argued Australia had “already affirmed our deep concern at the humanitarian impact of weapons use”. In that case, Wong approved the official recommendation. But Romuld said the statement was “a factual acknowledgement of the undeniably devastating humanitarian consequences of any nuclear weapons use, backed by over 140 governments and the International Committee of the Red Cross”. Australian officials continue to emphasise the importance of the longstanding Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Another document shows Australia’s goals for the NPT review conference in New York in August included “to provide reassurances that Aukus partners are steadfast in their commitment to the global non-proliferation regime and will set the highest possible standards in our acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T11:19:51Z","webTitle":"Persian power, Pinochet protests and postwar punks and princes – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","fields":{"bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Luxury and Power The struggle for power between ancient Greece and the Persian empire, seen in a radical new light. • British Museum, London, from 4 May to 13 August.

But this engrossing documentary by Hoop Dreams’ Steve James tells the story of someone who actually did something about it: Ted Hall, who confessed in 1998 – a year before his death – to having passed nuclear secrets to the Soviets while working on the Manhattan project. Recruited as an 18-year-old Harvard genius, he came to feel that a US monopoly on the bomb would threaten global stability and the future of humanity. A sensitive college boy and nascent communist who chafed against wearing military uniform at Los Alamos, Hall gave priceless schematics to Uncle Joe via his beatnik friend, the excellently named Saville Sax, who was the one who actually stepped inside the Soviet consulate. James gets inside the fulminating, jingoistic wartime US ambience through dramatic recreations of college trysts and FBI shakedowns, as well as Hall’s final interviews – notably the CNN spot in which he eventually came clean. But it’s anchoring this all in testimony from Hall’s now elderly wife, Joan, that gives A Compassionate Spy a passionate payload, making it as much a love story as a political chronicle. “A nonconformist, keeping clear of everyone else’s nonconformity,” is how she sums him up. “Did I forget to say he was beautiful?” Joan Hall emerges here as forthright and defiant – where her husband, later dubbed “the quiet American”, was self-effacing. Maybe it’s because of the 52-year period she had to keep stumm, jettisoning her own political activities as the FBI took an interest in the couple. One topic of conversation as the Los Alamos scientists were waiting for the Trinity test was apparently whether marriage would survive as an institution, but the Halls themselves seem to have upped the odds. She provided the steel to their operation, insisting that Ted hold his silence at crucial junctures, including when the CIA appeared to offer an olive branch. At times she crosses a prideful line, especially in the mental gymnastics needed to justify trading with the blatantly homicidal Russian dictator, or in her indignation over the subsequent arms race given her husband’s role in accelerating it. As the Halls’ idealism caused them to chew over such compromises at the dinner table, James’s sleek telling excels at intertwining the personal and the political with illuminating detail. Not least the revelation that what ultimately may have deflected attention from them is that Hall’s brother, Edward, developed the intercontinental ballistic missile destined to be carrying the payloads; it may have ultimately too damaging to the US nuclear programme if the FBI’s dirt-digging covered its leading missile scientist in muck too. One detail omitted here, though, is that Hall died of renal cancer, no doubt as a result of handling plutonium, but not before delivering some stark warnings about arms proliferation and the dangers of a potentially fascist America with its finger on the button. Both seem frighteningly close to coming to pass, though perhaps we also need to think about Hall’s ethos about sharing technological breakthroughs with respect to AI and China, too. This first-rate portrait gets intimate with an atomic-age Edward Snowden, all the better to cast a long shadow. • A Compassionate Spy is at Bertha DocHouse from 24 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-19T03:51:14Z","webTitle":"Daniel Andrews denies power is centralised in his office after Ibac investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","fields":{"bodyText":"Daniel Andrews has denied power is centralised in his office, after an anti-corruption inquiry found a $1.2m contract was awarded to a union due to pressure applied by Victorian government advisers. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission investigation into the contract, released on Wednesday, found staff in the health minister’s and premier’s private office “improperly influenced” health department officials to award a training contract to the Health Workers Union. The investigation, dubbed Operation Daintree, does not make any findings of corruption against Andrews, health ministers Jill Hennessy and Jenny Mikakos, or staff working in their offices. Ibac also made no findings of wrongdoing by the HWU’s secretary, Diana Asmar. But Ibac made a damning assessment of the “increasing influence of ministerial advisers and the centralisation of power in the PPO”. Both Hennessy and Mikakos, who were interviewed along with the premier by Ibac, told the commission they were concerned of the growing power within the premier’s office, with latter describing it as “having its tentacles everywhere”. After the report was tabled in parliament Andrews held a press conference with deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, in which he denied power had been centralised in his office. “I don’t accept that at all,” the premier said. “The notion that somehow the premier’s office today is a vastly different one to what it used to be in the past and it used to be some sort of timid outfit – no, that is just not right. “I wouldn’t expect integrity agencies who run very sweeping and broad commentary to have any appreciation whatsoever of what occurred in previous Labor or Liberal governments.” He said his staff worked “together” with their counterparts in ministerial offices to “get things done”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Andrews said neither Hennessy nor Mikakos raised concerns with him during their time in parliament. They resigned in 2021 and 2020, respectively. “[They were] not comments that were ever made to me, [they were] not concerns that were ever raised to me in thousands of interactions with the two people you’ve just cited over 20 years, and in fact, longer,” Andrews said. He repeatedly noted that there were “no adverse findings against anyone” in the report, which he described as “educational” in nature. “The staff members that are referred to in this report do not work for the government any more and have not worked for the government for years, and … the two ministers who are referenced in the report are not even members of the parliament any longer,” Andrews said. Opposition leader, John Pesutto, called on the premier to resign in the wake of the report. “The premier has been in power for more than eight years. How many more reports and corruption scandals do we need before the premier understands that he is the problem?” he said. “In the interests of Victorians, Daniel Andrews must now seriously consider whether he can tackle the corruption he’s allowed to flourish or whether it’s time for him to hand over to somebody who can. “Because you can’t be the problem and also be the solution.” Andrews did acknowledge “the recommendations do go to a number of serious matters”. He confirmed he would lead the process of considering the 17 recommendations, though he had reservations about one that would allow advisers to be called before parliamentary committees. “Staff don’t necessarily sign up to be part of a political debate and be ‘on the field’, as it were,” Andrews said. Ibac also reiterated previous recommendations, which integrity experts have repeatedly called for, including the maintenance of a lobbying register and the publication of ministerial diaries, which is currently in place in NSW and Queensland. It also wants the definition of “lobbyist” to be expanded to ensure it captures anyone engaged in “any contact with government representatives that is calculated to influence government and parliamentary functions”. The Victorian Greens’ acting leader, Tim Read, said the report had “laid bare the need to bring our integrity standards up to scratch”. “This means requiring detailed diaries of ministers and parliamentary secretaries to be made public … so Victorians can see who is influencing government decisions,” he said. “We must also legislate codes of conduct for lobbyists, ministers and their staff and strengthen them to require clearer information on potential conflicts of interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/23/inside-taiwan-standing-up-to-china-review-a-gripping-analysis-of-potential-nuclear-armageddon","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T22:00:02Z","webTitle":"Inside Taiwan: Standing Up to China review – a gripping analysis of potential nuclear Armageddon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/23/inside-taiwan-standing-up-to-china-review-a-gripping-analysis-of-potential-nuclear-armageddon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/23/inside-taiwan-standing-up-to-china-review-a-gripping-analysis-of-potential-nuclear-armageddon","fields":{"bodyText":"The knife-maker of Kinmen island, Wu Tseng-dong, has an unusual business model. When he was a boy, in the 1950s, he witnessed explosive shells – launched from the Chinese mainland two miles away – falling on his birthplace. As he explains: “479,000 rounds were fired in 44 days. We lived in fear.” Little did Wu Tseng-dong know then, but the People’s Liberation Army was supplying him with the raw material for his future livelihood: today he makes knives from those shells to sell to tourists from the mainland. Reporter Jane Corbin’s gripping analysis of rising tensions between the People’s Republic of China (capital: Beijing; leader: Xi Jinping; population: 1.4 billion) and the Republic of China (capital: Taipei; current leader: Tsai Ing-wen; population: 23 million) examines the possibility of history not just repeating itself, but of tensions escalating so far as to cause the return to geopolitical discourse of that quaint old term, nuclear Armageddon. In this scenario, Beijing bombards not just the little island of Kinmen (slightly bigger than Bute), but Taiwan itself (roughly the size of Switzerland), in order to reunify China. But it thereby embroils the US, provoking a worldwide conflict that would, so far as I understand it, depress global economic growth predictions even more than the coronavirus pandemic. Certainly, the Taiwanese people whom Corbin interviews are preparing for the worst case scenario. Ever since democratic Ukraine was invaded this time last year by an authoritarian superpower, the numbers of Taiwanese people paying to train at private military camps has risen exponentially, compulsory military service has been increased from four to 12 months, and Taipei’s “porcupine strategy” now involves stocking up on anti-air, anti-tank and anti-ship weapons so that a smaller force can frustrate a larger (Chinese forces are 12 times bigger than Taiwan’s, Corbin tells us) in line with Kyiv’s example. Tsai Ing-wen’s two-term presidency, which comes to an end later this year, is predicated on retaining Taiwanese democracy in the face of Beijing’s offer of reunification under an approach of “one country, two systems”. That principle which, as the relatively recent crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong demonstrated so clearly, means nothing in practice. But, will Beijing really invade Taiwan? Astutely, Corbin interviews Frank Huang of Powerchip Technology Corp, one of the many Taiwanese companies that makes the island the world centre for computer chips. Of the world’s advanced superconductors, 90% are made here. “Your car, your refrigerator, your PC – without Taiwan, it won’t work,” says Huang. Huang’s corollary? China dare not invade, since any war would threaten to destroy this most valuable of industries, whose lucrative secrets Beijing covets. This is perhaps true, but China and the US are working hard to develop their own superconductor industries. Taiwanese partners are working with US firms in Arizona to achieve just this. Beijing, Corbin reports, is using spies to uncover Taiwan’s superconductor secrets so it can manufacture its own, but, she estimates, Taiwan will remain a world leader in this vital industry for the next 10 years. Plus, any invasion is estimated to cost China trillions of dollars. Instead, war is being fought in the grey zone of cyberspace rather than on battlefields. Cyber hacking expert Puma Shen, of Doublethink Lab, estimates Taiwan is hit by 12m cyber-attacks a month. The country is subject to more disinformation than Twitter and Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social combined. Taiwan’s first transgender government minister, Audrey Tang, a former hacker turned minister of digital affairs, says disinformation has included homophobic fake news suggesting that Taiwan’s mooted same-sex marriage legislation would result in droves of HIV patients arriving from the rest of the world bent on receiving free treatment. Untrue, Tang says. But, as we in the west know from our own masters of post-truth politics, Trump and Johnson, little lies soon grow long legs. Sadly, Corbin couldn’t get face time with president Xi to set out his Taiwanese policy. Instead, she has the wonderful Victor Gao, fluent yet chilling media spokesperson for the Chinese Communist party. Gao only needs a stroked cat on his lap to truly perfect his Bond villain aura, as he tells Corbin: “The future of Taiwan will never be decided by the 23 million people of Taiwan themselves. The future of Taiwan will be decided by the more than 1.4 billion on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” The implication is clear: the rest of the world would do well to keep out of this domestic affair. Happily, history tells us, if nothing else, the world won’t listen to his advice. • Inside Taiwan: Standing Up to China was on BBC Two and is on iPlayer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T12:41:15Z","webTitle":"Christopher Nolan recreated nuclear explosion without CGI for new film ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","fields":{"bodyText":"Christopher Nolan has spoken of the challenges of showing an atomic explosion without resorting to computer-generated imagery for his new film, Oppenheimer. The director’s forthcoming biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, one of the pioneers of nuclear weapons during the second world war, involves a scene recreating the first atomic detonation in New Mexico in July 1945, a month before the US dropped similar bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, hastening the end of the conflict. “Recreating the Trinity test without the use of computer graphics was a huge challenge to take on,” Nolan told Total Film. “Andrew Jackson – my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on — was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself … there were huge practical challenges.” Nolan has long pioneered ambitious technical film-making while also mounting real-life stunts of considerable scale. He blew up a real Boeing 747 for 2020’s Tenet, flipped a truck for The Dark Knight and shot on top of melting glacier in Interstellar. Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy alongside Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Josh Hartnett.

America’s elite, he observed, forms a “compact social and psychological entity” that “towers over the underlying population of clerks and wage earners” and whose “values” are “differentiated” from those of the “lower classes”. “All their sons and daughters,” he added, “go to college, often after private schools; then they marry one another… After they are well married, they come to possess, to occupy, to decide.” Seven decades later, the British political scientist Matthew Goodwin similarly paints, in his new book Values, Voice and Virtue, a picture of “the new elite” in Britain. The brushstrokes are familiar, drawing on the work of communitarian and “post-liberal” thinkers of recent years. Britain has “a new dominant class” that has captured its institutions and imposes its “radically progressive cultural values” on the rest of the nation, adrift as it is from the conservative instincts of the majority. In its details, it’s a portrait that Mills would recognise. “Their very identity as high-flying, highly accomplished graduates of elite institutions,” Goodwin observes, “gives them a profoundly important and highly collective sense of unity” and “shapes their values and collective loyalties”. This sense of collective identity is “strengthened by their social networks, which are usually filled with other elite graduates from other elite universities. More often than not, people from the new graduate elite marry other members of the graduate elite.” That there are such echoes across the decades should not surprise us. The image of a distinct, new elite, defined by its education and values, and standing over the common people, has a long history, popping up throughout the 20th century. The roots of the contemporary debate about the new elite lie in the 1970s. The late Barbara Ehrenreich published with her husband, John, an essay in 1977 in which they coined the term “professional-managerial class” (PMC). There had developed, they argued, a new class of college-educated professionals, from engineers and middle managers to social workers and culture producers, that was distinct from the middle class of old but essential to the functioning of capitalism. The Ehrenreichs were hopeful that this class could be mobilised for progressive causes. They warned, however, that it could also give rise to “what may at first sight seem to be a contradiction in terms: anti-working class radicalism”. And that, many on the left have argued in recent years, is just what has happened. One of the most uncompromising analyses of “anti-working class radicalism” came in the American academic Catherine Liu’s acerbic tract, Virtue Hoarders. Drawing on the Ehrenreichs’ work, Liu argues that the PMC, ensconced in universities and thinktanks and NGOs, has turned into an elite that “finds in its particular tastes and cultural proclivities the justification for its unshakable sense of superiority to ordinary working-class people”; one that “prefers obscurantism, balkanization, and management of interest groups to a transformative reimagining of the social order”. They are “virtue hoarders” because of their desire to accumulate virtue as a means of enhancing self-worth. And they are in many ways synonymous with Goodwin’s “new elite”. Liu’s portrait of the PMC is far more astringent and over-the-top than anything Goodwin has produced. Yet, it is also more realistic. Liu does not pretend that the virtue hoarders constitute a new ruling class. As a supporter of Bernie Sanders, what provokes her ire is that they stand in the way of real social change, having abandoned class politics for what she calls “performative transgression”. And where Goodwin argues that the “radical woke” capture of society lies at “the roots of today’s more turbulent politics”, Liu understands that the new elite is the product, not the cause, of political turbulence, the consequence of the evisceration of mass movements for social change. For Goodwin, though, the new elite are the “people who really run Britain”, having largely displaced the old ruling class of “upper-class aristocrats, landowners and industrialists”. The idea that Gary Lineker or the US-based British journalist Mehdi Hasan or Sam Freedman, a fellow at the Institute for Government thinktank (all of whom Goodwin has namechecked as key members of the new elite) shape our lives more than Rishi Sunak or Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England is, to put it politely, stretching credulity. Similarly, the suggestion that those who have been responsible for austerity, anti-trade union laws and the imposition of real-terms wage cuts on nurses and railway workers are not the ones who really have power over our lives is bafflingly myopic. It exposes the postliberal concern for the working class as being as performative as the antiracism of the “new elite”. It is true that a new generation of thinkers and activists has helped consolidate a culture more given to identitarian thinking and more censorious in its outlook (though also one that is less racist, more accepting of women’s equality and more welcoming of gay people). To confuse that, however, with the claim that it constitutes the new ruling class is to have a weak understanding of how power works and where it lies. Liberals in the media, thinktanks and universities certainly help shape the national conversation. But, again, the issue is not nearly as straightforward as Goodwin suggests. He points to studies showing that most journalists are left wing. Yet, the media coverage of, and national conversation about, say, “stop the boats” policy or the Rwanda scheme has hardly been “left wing”. On the contrary, language once confined to the far right is now casually exploited by mainstream commentators. One could plausibly argue that someone like Goodwin himself shapes public debate more than most of the “new elite” to whom he points. A decade ago, Goodwin warned of voters being pulled in a reactionary direction by “a toxic and – to be frank – nasty group of opinion-makers in our society who appear to relish sowing the seeds of xenophobia, protest and division”, through their exploitation of the immigration issue. Today, Goodwin welcomes the Rwanda deportation scheme and advises the Tories to raise “the salience of cultural issues”. In that shift we can see how too great an obsession with the “new elite”, and too little acknowledgment of the real sources of social and economic power, creates a pull towards a form of politics that the earlier Goodwin would have recognised as “toxic”. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’d ticked off more than 90 of the 105 miles, almost all in dazzling spring sunshine. Such luck with the weather was encouraging complacency. But up high, any hubris is ripe for a humbling. And the mountain gods were beginning to conspire. The first hint of trouble came when I recognised the two fellow hikers coming the other way. In Tré-le-Champ, way below, we had drunk coffee at neighbouring tables and, realising we were on the same route, resolved to move on to beer when we saw each other again at the next refuge, La Flégère. So when I saw them marching back to the village, I stopped, assumed a quizzical face and asked: Est-ce la bonne direction? The second concern was that they were babbling, with eyes wide and urgent. Just an hour ago they had seemed calm and able to speak reasonable English. The third thing was the phrase one of them kept repeating: J’avais peur de mourir! I don’t speak much French, but this seemed a matter of mortal import. An hour after deciding against following them down, I understood. The weather had become awful and, with my hood pulled low, I almost walked into a wall of rock. After a step back, I saw that progress demanded the ascent of three ladders, bolted into the cliff face but rusting under fierce elemental assault. Moving between the ladders required traversing metal platforms, each five feet long and the width of a walking boot. The guidebook had insisted the climb was no bother. Perhaps in fair weather. Just then the wind was lending a shoulder to the rain and battering every inch of my Gore-Tex. A man was coming down the other way, practising an incantation: “Three points contact, three points contact.” After an age he landed and sized me up while tucking loose straps into my bag. We spoke a little and he reassured me we had similar experience levels. Move one limb at a time and you’ll be fine, he said. All the rungs are stable and even. I knelt, breathed deep, and tied my laces in a double bow. Halfway up, I started saying it: “Three points contact, three points contact.” I heaved a leg, then an arm, a leg, then an arm. After an eternity – there were more ladders beyond the first three – I hauled myself over the top. My heart rate was 170 beats a minute. This was the last-but-one day of an eight-day trek over high mountains and not once had it gone above 160. The ladders were the last serious trial of a demanding itinerary. The route weaves across the mountaintop borders of France, Italy and Switzerland, with a total ascent exceeding the elevation of Mount Everest. More than once I had sympathy with middle-aged men, beached and breathless on top of a peak. Sleeping was a different challenge: nights were spent either wedged between snoring hippos in dorms or freezing under canvas. Still, the scenery makes up for everything. On Mont Blanc, all is in motion. In the purest, most exact morning light, I stood for hours looking at exposed shelves, tracing my eye over the waves, remains of when the peaks were formed. As Robert Macfarlane puts it in Mountains of the Mind, these landscapes can make one marvel at the forces necessary to knead sandstone. This is a world “where granite slops about like porridge, basalt bubbles like stew, and layers of limestone are folded as easily as blankets”. These are sublime sights: the height, light and power send volts through the soul. The thrills are constant and, after a time, there is a risk of overstimulation, of senses being singed. On the saddle of yet another wondrous col, the dizzied mind can turn inwards to the comfort of drudgery. The present can fade. The real genius of the trail, though, is that whenever it senses indifference, it takes umbrage and shakes you back to life. The ladders excepted, it does this with pleasure, not peril. Outside Rifugio Bonatti in Italy’s Aosta valley I collapsed on a bank. It had been a long, hot climb out of Courmayeur with an appalling hangover and, as I closed my eyes, I pined for the comfort of a double bed. Then, as the breeze lifted the sweat from my neck, I looked across the valley to the mountain ridge just as the sun was waving goodbye. The Grandes Jorasses looked so close I felt I could run my hands down the runnels. A lime green butterfly pecked at the nectar of a violet flower, then floated on to rust-coloured blueberry bushes. That evening, I stepped outside into the cold and saw, sitting snug in the blue relief of the mountain silhouette, the stars of the plough. My mind simply couldn’t be anywhere else. After the trek, I delayed reality with one of Bluerise’s yoga retreats in Les Houches, just outside Chamonix. I thought it would be the perfect way to recover. It did exactly as I’d hoped, with great company and wonderful food complementing the perfect amount of exercise. But I soon realised the yoga would also help train that elusive feeling of presence. After the daily morning flow session on the deck, we sat wrapped in blankets and looked out at the mountains, felt the soft sun, watched our breath rise and fall. If there was mist, it wouldn’t last; the wind would lift a flap from the sky and there it would be, Mont Blanc, cloaked in silver snow. In those moments, I was rapt. After years of my attention span dwindling, it was bliss to welcome some back. Living solely in the present is wonderful. It is also an indulgence. Sometimes the future demands notice. On one of the guided walks around the Chamonix valley we heard a rumble and saw a puff of dust, evidence of a rockfall. Our guide said there were now more than ever. The permafrost, which acts as cement for the rocks high up, is melting. Even mountains – totemic, everlasting mountains – are vulnerable to climate change. How to do it The classic route is to start in Les Houches, progressing anticlockwise in a circle back to Les Houches. But some prefer to start elsewhere, or to tackle it clockwise. Where to stay The style and price of mountain refuges varies across countries, but most give a hearty alpine meal, breakfast and a bed in a dorm for about €60. The best place to book is montourdumontblanc.com, but most of the best refuges – Rifugio Bonnatti and Rifugio Elisabetta particularly – will be booked up well in advance. I brought my tent and stayed on campsites half the time. One should be wary of wild camping in Switzerland though – it’s strictly interdit. Yoga The Bluerise Yoga and Hiking retreat costs £1,485 for a week, including accommodation, all food and yoga classes.

Providing low-carbon electricity for about 6m homes, Sizewell C will stand alongside two existing stations, Sizewell B and the decommissioned Sizewell A. I live close enough to see the 60-metre tall, white dome of Sizewell B almost every day. When I want to torture myself, I look at developer EDF’s “construction phase visualisations” of the 1,380-acre building site, with its towering spoil heaps and forest of cranes, and wonder if this is what it will take to save the planet. What might not have been immediately obvious in the coverage of the government’s decision was that the Planning Inspectorate, tasked with assessing such projects, had recommended that permission be refused. The problem, the examiners explained, was fairly simple: EDF couldn’t say exactly where it would obtain one of the main substances needed to make a nuclear power station work, that substance being water. As well as uranium, a reactor of the kind EDF plans to build needs water in very great volumes. Saltwater will do for part of the process, which is one reason why nuclear power stations are usually built beside the sea. But fresh or “potable” water will also be needed – first, to cool the two reactors, and then, just as importantly, to cool the irradiated fuel once it has been removed from the reactors. For this, absolutely pure water is essential. Sizewell B uses about 800,000 litres of potable water per day; Sizewell C, with its twin reactors, will need more than 2m litres per day, and as much as 3.5m litres per day during construction. Last September, during the closing hearings of the six-month public planning examination, the question of just where the developer was going to get the water to run Sizewell C, let alone build it, was becoming urgent. Those who had raised concerns about precisely this issue more than 10 years earlier would have been forgiven for feeling frustrated. As one of the driest parts of the country, Suffolk is described by the Environment Agency as “seriously water stressed”. By 2043, eight years into Sizewell C’s 60-year operating life, the agency anticipates a water deficit in the county of more than 7m litres a day. Northumbrian Water, which operates locally as Essex and Suffolk Water, had made it clear to EDF that there was not enough local groundwater for either construction or operation. EDF’s plan, therefore, was to build a pipeline to bring water from the River Waveney, 18 miles away on the Norfolk border. During at least the first two years of construction, while the pipeline was being built, EDF planned to install a temporary desalination plant on the site to turn saltwater from the sea into fresh. Then, in August, the water company broke the news that its abstraction licenses dictating how much water it could extract from the Waveney, granted by the Environment Agency, were likely to be reduced by up to 60% to safeguard downstream levels. It subsequently confirmed that the Waveney did not, after all, have the capacity to supply water for for any of the 10-year construction phase. Desalination, opponents of the project noted, was a solution EDF itself had discounted in January 2021 “due to concerns with power consumption, sustainability, cost and wastewater discharge”. And yet, desalination, with all the problems it had set out (including discharging millions of litres a day of saline concentrate and phosphorus into the North Sea), remains EDF’s “fallback” solution for running the station, as well as building it, if another source can’t be found. Northumbrian Water has since confirmed that: “Existing water resources (including the River Waveney) will not be sufficient to meet forecast mains water demand, including the operational demand of Sizewell C.” For his part, the secretary of state, Kwasi Kwarteng, has a “reasonable level of certainty” that 2m litres of water a day will be found from elsewhere by the time the reactors are ready to be switched on. Perhaps, as Northumbrian Water has suggested, by piping it in from Essex (though Essex isn’t overburdened with water); or by reducing household wastage; or by reusing effluent. It will be for the Environment Agency, the Water Services Regulation Authority, Natural England and the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure that everything is done properly at such time as a water source – some kind of source – is settled upon. The more I look at those mock-ups of the building site, the more they seem like a metaphor for another kind of despoilment. Given the government’s stated intention to build a fleet of new nuclear power stations across the country, it’s not just people who live in Suffolk who have reason to wonder what the secretary of state’s decision to wash his hands of Sizewell C’s water problem says about the resilience of the systems we entrust with safeguarding our environment. Still, the foundations will be laid, I suppose, and the cranes will rise, and after 10 years and £20bn (by EDF’s reckoning), Sizewell C will be built. And when the time comes for its reactors to go critical, there will be water, because if there isn’t, Suffolk will have a new tourist attraction to rival Framlingham Castle: the most expensive white elephant in human history. What this fait accompli means for Suffolk’s rivers and seawater, let alone for the county’s householders and farmers, are not questions that will be answered before building begins. It’s enlightening, in this context, to consider that the past six months have been the driest in Suffolk for more than a quarter of a century, and the driest in England since 1976. “The secretary of state disagrees with the examining authority’s conclusions on this matter,” Wednesday’s decision letter states, “and considers that the uncertainty over the permanent water supply strategy is not a barrier to granting consent to the proposed development.” During last year’s planning hearings, two stories kept coming back to me: the biblical account of Moses in the desert, making water gush from a rock by striking it with his staff; and the Brothers Grimm tale in which a giant clasps a stone in his fist, and crushes it until, finally, water is forced out. • William Atkins is the author of The Immeasurable World: Journeys in Desert Places and The Moor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T11:30:16Z","webTitle":"The big idea: will fusion power save us from the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"One look at your energy bills this winter might have convinced you that the 1950s idea that electricity would, in the near future, become “too cheap to meter” was not so much a false promise as a sick joke. That over-excited claim was prompted by hopes that nuclear fusion – the process triggered in an uncontrolled manner in hydrogen bombs – would soon be harnessed for power generation. In the type of nuclear power we have today, disintegration of radioactive atoms such as uranium produces heat but also a troublesome legacy of radioactive waste that will stay active for millennia. Fusion power plants would instead generate energy using the same process that powers the sun: fusing of the dense nuclei of hydrogen atoms, releasing some of the formidable energy held in the atomic nucleus, with only helium as the byproduct, and without the pollution. Today the allure of fusion energy lies not so much in its price as its almost negligible carbon emissions, and therefore its potential to save us from the ravages of global heating. But will it arrive in time to stop the planet frying? There are plenty of uncertainties and unknowns around fusion energy, but on this question we can be clear. Since what we do about carbon emissions in the next two or three decades is likely to determine whether the planet gets just uncomfortably or catastrophically warmer by the end of the century, then the answer is no: fusion won’t come to our rescue. But if we can somehow scramble through the coming decades with makeshift ways of keeping a lid on global heating, there’s good reason to think that in the second half of the century fusion power plants will gradually help rebalance the energy economy. Perhaps it’s this wish for a quick fix that drives some of the hype with which advances in fusion science and technology are plagued. Take the announcement last December of a “major breakthrough” by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The NIF team reported that, in their efforts to develop a somewhat unorthodox form of fusion called inertial confinement fusion (ICF), they had produced more energy in their reaction chamber than they had put in to get the fusion process under way. Problem solved? Sadly not. As NIF scientists readily admitted, the energy generated by super-intense laser needed to spark fusion was less than a hundredth of the total amount of energy consumed by the lasers themselves. So they still have to do about a hundred times better to break even. And that’s even before factoring in the energy losses in converting the heat created by fusion into electricity. What’s more, the hi-tech pellets containing special forms of hydrogen used as fuel each cost more than $100,000, whereas a working ICF reactor would need to burn up 10 pellets a second at a cost of less than $1 each. ICF has so far been little studied as a source of energy anyway; NIF’s principal mission is to study nuclear reactions in order to help maintain the US stockpile of atomic weapons. Most work on fusion energy uses a different approach called magnetic confinement, in which the fuel – at temperatures of around a hundred million degrees, several times hotter than the centre of the sun and fiery enough to melt any material instantly – is suspended by magnetic fields, typically in a large doughnut-shaped chamber called a tokamak. Making and operating such a device raises eye-watering engineering challenges, with which fusion scientists and technicians have been grappling for decades. Many current hopes are pinned on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) being built in southern France. As the name suggests, Iter won’t be a power plant – it is strictly an experimental facility, its goal being to solve some of the engineering problems so that we can work out what a commercial fusion plant should look like. The construction of Iter’s massive tokamak started in 2013 (the project itself began in 1988) – but the facility is already way over budget (the current estimated cost is €20bn) and behind schedule. When a further delay in Iter was announced in January – it might not switch on until 2035 or so – some cynics wheeled out the old saw that fusion is perpetually just 20 years away. But such setbacks are to be expected when you consider the magnitude of what’s being attempted: to make a piece of a star on Earth. Not all of the fusion eggs are in this one basket. The EU is planning a smaller prototype plant called Demo. Another, called Sparc, is now being built in Massachusetts in a collaboration between MIT and the private fusion company Commonwealth Fusion Systems. China, Japan and Russia have their own plans, and there are several dozen private companies worldwide with ambitious goals. All the same, most fusion experts believe we’ll be lucky to have a prototype plant producing a net gain by 2040, and it’s unlikely that fusion energy will be going into the grid in significant amounts before 2050. When fusion start-ups announce that they’ll have a working reactor generating power within a decade, it’s a message for investors, not a realistic promise. These companies will have their part to play – not as the plucky underdogs who crack the problem but as providers of parts and expertise in the fusion industrial ecosystem. All the same, some researchers worry that over-promising could foster complacency that stymies investment in the urgently needed stopgap alternatives to fossil fuels, such as renewables and nuclear fission. The Soviet fusion pioneer Lev Artsimovich once said that humankind would have fusion energy “when society needs it”. In one sense he was sadly mistaken: we needed it years ago, before the lethal heatwaves, the wildfires, the shrinking ice caps. But it’s not too much to hope that we will have it before we make the planet uninhabitable, and that it can eventually turn the climate crisis into a catastrophe averted. Cynicism about fusion is cheap, but the progress is undeniable, and even exciting – so long as we keep it in perspective.
