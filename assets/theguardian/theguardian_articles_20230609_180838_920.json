Seismic surveys in the Irish Sea near Cumbria get under way on Saturday to explore whether the area is suitable for a proposed facility. The UK government is seeking a location for a deep underground repository to store the world’s largest stockpile of untreated nuclear waste. Officials have said that a decades-long accumulation of materials including more than 100 tonnes of plutonium – which could create thousands of nuclear bombs – cannot sustainably be stored above ground for ever and they are therefore searching for a site to “keep it safe and secure over the hundreds of thousands of years it will take for the radioactivity to naturally decay”. In 2019, radioactivity leaked into the soil beneath Sellafield, in Cumbria, which saw a serious leakage in the 1970s and was not built with decommissioning in mind. There are 20 surface facilities that store highly radioactive waste across the UK. About 750,000 cubic metres, equivalent to 70% of the volume of Wembley stadium, is earmarked for “geological disposal”. But impacts related to noise exposure from seismic gun blasts have been linked to vastly reduced sightings of whales, whose primary sense is acoustic. There is also concern over storing nuclear waste underwater, with just a handful of such sites globally. The Zoological Society of London’s cetacean strandings investigation programme manager, Rob Deaville, said that seismic blasts can cause habitat avoidance, risk excluding mammals from an area, and raise the risk of decompression sickness. “Potential impacts can also include direct physical effects ranging from temporary or permanent threshold shifts in hearing to direct blast trauma,” he told the Guardian. There are also concerns that the blasts may drown out mating calls and even cause deaths, after more than 800 dolphins washed ashore in Peru in 2012 after seismic tests. On the Cumbria survey, Deaville added that the area is a known habitat for porpoises, dolphins and other species. “Our teams are very much on standby, in the event we receive increased reports of live/dead strandings over this period.” In a letter to campaigners shared with the Guardian, an official from the Marine Management Organisation, a public body, acknowledged “the potential disturbance to certain cetacean species” but noted that the plans were largely exempt from regulations. Critics also suggest it may be impossible to predict the consequences of storing heat-generating nuclear waste beneath the sea in perpetuity. The chair of Nuclear Free Local Authorities (NFLA), David Blackburn, also leader of the Green party group at Leeds city council, told the Guardian: “The waste would be left in situ for millennia and, no matter how effective the barriers, some of the radioactivity will eventually reach the surface. The rate at which radioactivity would leak from a [geological disposal facility (GDF)] can be poorly predicted and is likely to remain so for an indefinite period. “Rather than solving a problem for future generations, it could be leaving them a legacy of a nuclear waste dump gradually releasing radioactivity into the environment and cutting off their options for deciding how to deal with this waste.” The NFLA prefers the idea of a “near surface, near site storage of waste” to allow for monitoring and management, and action in the event of a leakage. “Further scientific research may yield advancements that could mean that radioactive waste can be treated such as to make it less toxic in a shorter time period,” Blackburn added. “Chucking it in a hole in the ground or under the seabed precludes this possibility.” However, experts have said there is international agreement on the benefits of disposing of radioactive waste in deep geological repositories, and that it is the most appropriate long-term solution. “This consensus is based on scientific and technical work that has been carried out over several decades, including extensive research, development and demonstration programmes,” said a 2013 paper. Chris Eldred, the senior project manager for geosphere characterisation at the government organisation Nuclear Waste Services, launched this year to help oversee the decommissioning, said: “A deep GDF will protect future generations from the risks of keeping hazardous radioactive waste in surface stores for thousands of years. It is one of the largest environmental protection projects in the UK. “To help us with this vital work, we will undertake surveys within English territorial waters to provide a better understanding of the deep geology beyond the coast, while doing everything we can to minimise any environmental impact. “These surveys will use sound waves, the same technology that’s routinely deployed worldwide in industries such as offshore wind, carbon capture and storage, and major infrastructure projects, and along the lines of that used in medical ultrasound imaging. The information we obtain from these surveys will enable us to better understand whether a location could host a GDF and in turn will help inform discussions with communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/13/lake-powell-drought-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-13T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"As drought shrivels Lake Powell, millions face power crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/13/lake-powell-drought-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/13/lake-powell-drought-electricity","fields":{"bodyText":"Bob Martin, the deputy power manager at the Glen Canyon dam, gestures at the band of whitish, chalky residue running along the steep canyon walls towering above the Colorado River. “That’s where the water level used to be,” says Martin. “It’s fallen lower than even the lowest end of the scale thought possible when the dam was constructed.” The miles-long “bathtub ring,” bleached white by water over years, is a glaring symbol of the crisis unfolding at the Colorado River basin, which is suffering its driest period for more than 12 centuries. At the epicenter of this slow-burn environmental disaster embroiling the US south-west is Lake Powell, an artificial reservoir on the Colorado River created through the flooding of Glen Canyon in 1963. Alongside Nevada’s Lake Mead, Powell is one of the two largest reservoirs in the nation, holding 24m acre feet of water and spanning the Arizona-Utah border, and together they provide a vital water supply to a combined 40 million people in the south-west. Lake Powell is also a major source of hydropower: the vast pressure of the Colorado River traveling through the Glen Canyon dam’s 15-foot pipes, which spins turbines and then powers eight generators, produces cheap and clean energy for as many as 5.8 million homes and businesses across seven states. But dwindling water levels at Lake Powell, which is now at 28% of its 24m acre-feet capacity, have put the Glen Canyon dam at risk. In March, water levels fell below 3,525 feet – considered a critical buffer to protect hydropower – for the first time. If the lake drops just another 32ft, the dam will no longer be able to generate power for the millions who rely on it. Such a calamity might not be far off. The Bureau of Reclamation, the US federal agency that manages the Colorado River’s infrastructure, forecasts that even with significant proposed cuts to water allowances there is a 23% chance power production could halt at dam in 2024 due to low water levels and that it is within the realm of possibility that it will happen as soon as July 2023. As the lake vanishes, water managers are scrambling to find a solution, including an unprecedented conservation order. But some worry that efforts may fall short as states battle over whatever water is available – foreshadowing fights for resources that are only set to intensify as drought further grips the arid south-west. “It’s a gigantic warning,” says Lisa Meiman, a spokesperson for the Western Area Power Administration (Wapa), a federal company that provides wholesale hydropower to 15 states through 57 dams, including Glen Canyon. “The rapid decline of Lake Powell has been surprising. There’s no doubt we are heading towards a drier future.” Sputtering electricity Lake Powell’s considerable power-generating abilities are already on the decline. When the lake is full, its dam can produce 1,320 megawatts, or 5bn kilowatt-hours of power annually – about the same amount as a large fossil fuel plant. But with water levels now 100 feet below the lowest elevation marker, hydropower production has dropped to 800 megawatts. The alarming drop has forced authorities into extraordinary action. On 14 June, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that to protect critical reservoir levels in 2023, between 2m and 4m acre-feet of water must be conserved, setting a 60-day timeline for state and tribal leaders to agree on a plan. Water use estimates released in June show the upper basin states collectively used 3.5m acre-feet of Colorado River water last year, while the lower basin states used about 10m acre-feet. “The system is at a tipping point,” Commissioner Camille Touton told the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. “Unprecedented is now the reality and the normal in which Reclamation must manage our systems.” According to Jack Schmidt, the Janet Quinney Lawson chair of Colorado River studies at Utah State University, that would be the largest cut in water use in the 100-year history of the Colorado River Compact, an agreement made in 1922 that divided the river’s water between the upper basin states (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming), the lower basin states (Arizona, California and Nevada), 30 tribal nations and Mexico. “It’s huge,” says Schmidt, who believes the cutbacks could represent up to a third of water use in the entire basin. “We have to reduce consumption right now,” says Schmidt. “That’s the only big solution that is available.” Several unprecedented changes are already in place. Over the next year Lake Powell will hold back 500,000 acre-feet of water usually sent to Lake Mead – further squeezing supply on the lower basin states – and for the first time will receive an extra 500,000 acre-feet from Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming, one of a handful of much smaller water bodies that can be drawn on. But Jack Stauss of the Glen Canyon Institute, a non-profit that has been researching the canyon since 1996, says the import of water from other reservoirs is a “simple band-aid fix” that will not solve the underlying problems. “These are completely short-term measures,” he says. “Flaming Gorge has a fraction of the capacity of Lake Powell. You’ll quickly drain it.” The demise of the Glen Canyon dam, which serves 50 Native American tribes, would affect rural, underserved communities the hardest and alternative energy such as coal or nuclear will probably be more expensive and less green, according to Meiman. Already, the hydropower shortfall means that since January 2021 Wapa has spent $78m of a $146m buffer fund it had to buy alternative power for its customers in times of shortages. Now, customers must accept up to a 40% price increase, or accept the uncertainty of receiving a fixed percentage of the dam’s shrinking output. The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, which sources 40% of its energy from hydropower, estimates its operating costs will rise by $4.5m this year, which will pass onto its 43,000 residential and commercial customers. “The Navajo community will be disproportionately impacted,” says Srinivasa Venigalla, the authority’s deputy general manager. Beyond the power it generates, the Glen Canyon dam also provides crucial services to the grid. Hydropower – unlike solar, wind and gas – can instantly ramp up supply, which is particularly important when demand is high, such as during heat waves, when a sudden imbalance between electric supply and demand could lead to a power blackout, a study by consultancy firm Power Consulting found in 2018. Stalled negotiations Lake Powell’s power woes come as the Colorado River basin’s climate is rapidly changing. Called the “lifeline of the south-west”, water flow in the Colorado river could drop 30% by 2050 and 55% by 2100 due to greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2017 study. Currently, 66% of the western US is experiencing severe or extreme drought. Yet political division over water use and management has slowed progress over how to respond. Many point to the role of the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry, which accounts for 79% of water use in the south-west. Others say municipal consumption must change in what is effectively a desert region, as Las Vegas looks to crack down on garden turf, which requires regular irrigation, and increase the use of recycled water. Meanwhile, some leaders have insisted on the right to continued use. “Neither the upper nor lower states want to make these cuts,” says Schmidt. “How many weeks will go by for this high stakes negotiation? Then how strong is their pressure going to be to force the states and tribal leaders into an agreement?” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the Department of the Interior, said that unilateral federal action was a possibility if states fail to come to an agreement in time. “We have a responsibility to make determinations for supply and demand every year and we will make those determinations,” Trujillo said. “We are taking the situation very seriously.” Chuck Cullom, executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate agency that administers Colorado River water in the upper basin, said that he remained optimistic that a deal will be struck. “The water managers understand the consequences of failing to act,” he says. “Water delivery to the Glen Canyon is vital to not only the upper basin, Page and Navajo Nation but to the region. The Glen Canyon dam makes western power grid reliable.” For now, the future of Lake Powell remains in flux. The National Park Service has already been forced to shut down 11 boat ramps at the Lake Powell recreation area, which draws millions of visitors each year, mainly based out of the town of Page, Arizona. Danny Woods, owner of the Lake Powell Adventure Company, which has run kayak tours along the Colorado River since 2008, said that last year he stopped doing visits to Antelope Canyon – a slot canyon famed for its dramatic red rock – where it is becoming increasingly difficult to land boats. “The water is extraordinarily low,” he says. Like many in Page, Woods is optimistic that the tourism industry can adapt, but acknowledges it will require a painful shift to a new, more frugal future. “We’ve been overusing the resources. If you’re in the desert, you shouldn’t be eating seafood, shipping things all over or flushing poop in clean water. This is a wake up call.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/21/bypassing-democracy-victorian-proposal-to-cut-local-councils-planning-powers-draws-ire-from-peak-body","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T15:00:46Z","webTitle":"‘Bypassing democracy’: Victorian proposal to cut local councils’ planning powers draws ire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/21/bypassing-democracy-victorian-proposal-to-cut-local-councils-planning-powers-draws-ire-from-peak-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/21/bypassing-democracy-victorian-proposal-to-cut-local-councils-planning-powers-draws-ire-from-peak-body","fields":{"bodyText":"A proposal being considered by the Victorian government to limit the powers of councils over big developments purportedly to increase housing supply is being criticised as “bypassing local democracy” by a local government association. In an attempt to increase housing density in exisiting suburbs, the government is considering winding back the planning powers of local councils in the hopes of fast-tracking developments near public transport, the Age has reported. The chief executive of the Victorian Local Governance Association, Kathryn Arndt, said the body and its member councils recognised the state’s housing problem but want to work collaboratively with the state government to fix it. “Local councils understand their communities and whether individual planning applications are in their best interests,” she said. “Bypassing local democracy is not the answer to our housing crisis.” Arndt said the state’s planning system was designed to give people a “democratic voice in their local communities” and pointed to the planning minister already having extensive powers, including the ability to override local governments in exceptional circumstances. “Expanding ministerial powers further at the expense of local communities would be a mistake,” she said. It comes after the new New South Wales housing minister, Rose Jackson, said last week she was determined to see medium- and high-density housing built in Sydney’s north shore and eastern suburbs. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Property Council has also reportedly backed a process to fast-track planning approvals and cut out local government to help develop medium- and high-density dwellings in Melbourne’s suburbs. The Municipal Association of Victoria’s president, David Clark, said planning should focus on building and growing communities rather than “lining developers’ pockets”. Clark said any move to sideline councils would “put at risk the transparency and effectiveness of the current system.” “Victorians expect to be consulted on significant development within their neighbourhoods and councils are the best place for this consultation to take place,” he said. Clark said the peak body had sought an urgent meeting with the planning minister to discuss the proposed changes. The mayor of Merri-bek city council in Melbourne’s north, Angelica Panopoulos, said it was vital that councils were empowered to determine planning applications that helped boost the liveability of an area. “We appreciate the importance of neighbourhood character, but it is also always changing,” she said. “We need to manage that change in a respectful way that looks out for existing and future residents.” Panopoulos – a member of the Victorian Greens – said the council backed new developments in Merri-bek that provided public and affordable housing and would support projects that featured “quality design in appropriate areas of our municipality”. “Higher-density developments in established areas like Merri-bek are a necessary part of delivering the large number of homes needed for our growing population.” A spokesperson for the Victorian government confirmed an update of Plan Melbourne – that sets the city’s planning strategy – was under way and would be considered this year. “We will continue to work with councils, industry and local communities to improve housing choice and affordability close to jobs, services and public transport,” the spokesperson said. The director of RMIT’s Centre for Urban Research, Jago Dodson, said the government’s reform could take different pathways and could include appointing a government agency the powers to override local government’s applications of residential zones within their municipalities. Dodson said it was vital that the reforms focused on quality development, access to amenities like parks and had a focus on affordable housing. “It needs to have a social dimension to it too,” he said. “If developers are making large profits, some of that should be captured to support public infrastructure.” He said the proposed changes would require legislation to pass parliament. The opposition on Wednesday said removing councils for planning processes was not a substitute for real planning or proper investment in infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/oct/19/nuclear-bomb-us-fallout-shelters","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Is the US better prepared for a nuclear blast today than it was 60 years ago?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/19/nuclear-bomb-us-fallout-shelters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/19/nuclear-bomb-us-fallout-shelters","fields":{"bodyText":"If you look hard enough, you’ll spot faded yellow signs proclaiming “Fallout shelter” around New York City. They are remnants of a cold war program that signaled spaces within ordinary buildings – from schools to banks to the Brooklyn Bridge – with adequate supplies and walls thick enough for riding out a nuclear blast safely. Many of these windowless shelters housed little more than rats and sewage before the practice was terminated in 1979. In 2017, the city’s department of education ordered the “misleading” signs removed from its buildings, but many others remain –– vestiges of nuclear fears that never materialized. Those fears feel a little more real again amid Vladimir Putin’s repeated nuclear threats. In July, New York mayor Eric Adams’s office published a public service announcement about what to do in case of a blast. A couple of weeks ago, nuclear preparedness re-entered headlines when the Department of Health and Human Services announced it was buying a supply of the anti-radiation drug Nplate, though the agency denied it was in response to any specific threat. All of this raises the question: are we better prepared today to survive a nuclear blast than we were 60 years ago, when it seemed all we could do was head to the basement and pray? Jeff Schlegelmilch has been trying to answer this question for years as the head of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, a Columbia University research program that works with government agencies. But while the United States has made many advances in nuclear preparedness since the cold war, “some of those have eroded because of funding cuts and attention going elsewhere,” he said. One of the biggest challenges is educating the public, which requires sustained communication –– something that’s become nearly impossible given today’s political polarization and short attention spans, Schlegelmilch said. Because of this, disaster preparedness officials look for “teachable moments” like big news events to get their messaging through. And while we’re not currently at the level of “everybody to the bunker, grab your helmet”, this is an important opportunity to get people informed, he said. In the event of a nuclear incident, preparedness experts agree you should shelter inside a building with thick walls and remain for at least 24 hours to avoid the worst of radioactive fallout while awaiting further instructions, or “Get inside, stay inside, stay tuned,” the phrase recited in a recent New York City public service announcement. If there is a nuclear explosion, text messages called Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) will probably be sent out. What may be of larger concern in the nuclear preparedness realm are issues likely to emerge after any initial blast. Aside from a scenario of total Armageddon, it’s likely millions of people would survive but need urgent care. And while Schlegelmilch said government agencies have been doing “very serious” behind-the-scenes work for many decades, he worries it’s not nearly enough. “When it comes to special needs, when it comes to more of the social aspects, we’re still not as ready,” he said. Two of the most important offices overseeing the US’s nuclear preparedness efforts – the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), and the less well-known Administration of Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the disaster response division of the Department of Health and Human Services – have summed up their approach for allocating scarce resources after a nuclear disaster in two giant guidebooks. Fema’s Planning Guide for Response to a Nuclear Detonation, last updated in May, and ASPR’s 212-page A Decision Makers Guide: Medical Planning and Response for a Nuclear Detonation, last refreshed in 2017, are meant to offer expertise to officials in the event of a crisis on everything from nuclear fallout patterns to recommended messaging to triaging burn victims. Both agencies have also invested heavily in tech tools including dashboards that aim to give decision-makers live visualizations of unfolding disasters, and Fema’s “Improvised Nuclear Device City Planner Resource Tool” –– kind of an apocalyptic SimCity that lets officials visually game out what a nuclear blast might look like and how to respond. These hi-tech investments can feel reassuring, but they aren’t nearly enough on their own. Although ASPR maintains the US’s strategic national stockpile, a cache of lifesaving drugs including anti-radiation medicine, Schlegelmilch said health resources in the aftermath of a nuclear blast, or the ability to distribute the resources it has, greatly concern him. He is particularly worried that there won’t be sufficient mental health and social services: “Those are areas which people will always say are very important, but we don’t see the additional resources.” And in the aftermath of any potential nuclear catastrophe, there will be far more people who need those services than will be available, he said. One of the main problems is that there have been huge cuts to disaster preparedness programs that were enacted after 9/11. A key program, ASPR’s Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), described as the “primary source of federal funding for healthcare system preparedness and response” for large-scale emergencies and disasters, lost 62% of its funding by 2021. There also doesn’t seem to be political will to invest more in disaster preparedness, despite the Covid pandemic. “It’s really shocking to me that we aren’t seeing a more cohesive push for preparedness in the face of what we’ve all just gone through,” Schlegelmilch said. “A lot of it comes down to the polarization in our politics –– and that’s a very, very dangerous path to go down. It’s preventing us from taking the kinds of actions that are staring us in the face.” Schlegelmilch said that same polarization could also cause mayhem in the aftermath of a nuclear event: if you thought Covid misinformation was bad –– imagine nuclear blast deniers. “We’re raised to think the world is very deterministic, and if we can just figure out all the variables, we can crack the code and know what we need to do. My experience is that the world is much more chaotic, with spheres of probability: we know what will make us more likely to do well in an adverse event. So I’m okay with incremental progress, as long as it’s in the right direction,” he said, adding that even without a nuclear blast, preparing for one will help us survive other disasters, like pandemics and climate change. “When we look at the root causes of disasters as an intersection of all these different aspects of civil society, we do see common threads,” Schlegelmilch said. “There’s value in investing in resilience, there’s value in investing in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/01/europe-shantytown-canada-real-madrid-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-01T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"‘This is hell’: two years and no power in Europe’s largest shantytown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/01/europe-shantytown-canada-real-madrid-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/01/europe-shantytown-canada-real-madrid-spain","fields":{"bodyText":"The struggle to survive without electricity for two whole years has left its mark on the flesh and fabric of sector six of the Cañada Real. It is there in the second-degree burns on the leg of the little boy who got too close to a gas heater, and in the dry, cracked hands of the woman who does the family’s washing with a stone and a bar of soap. It is there in the solar panels that have appeared on the roofs of the luckier residents, and in the fires that burn in the cold, dark homes of the less fortunate. And it is there in the memories of the people of Europe’s largest shantytown, which lies half an hour’s drive from the centre of Madrid. Some remember swaddling their blue-faced babies against the cold of Storm Filomena, or trying to coax their children to school knowing they would be bullied because of the smell of their unwashed bodies and clothes. Others remember the nights spent awake and listening to the sirens of the ambulances rushing towards people who had been poisoned by their butane heaters. Houda Akrikez’s strongest memory, though, is of a candle and a rally. Sixteen days after the lights went out on 2 October 2020 – the energy provider Naturgy says illegal, “intensive and irregular use” overloaded the system and triggered emergency shutdowns – Akrikez rose early to round people up for a protest march on the local offices of the Madrid regional government. She left her daughters sleeping at home in the care of her mother, who had lit a candle in the living room. But then Akrikez’s mother insisted on accompanying her as it was still dark outside. “I managed to get about 50 people together for the march and I was delighted,” says Akrikez. “Then I heard my sister-in-law calling out for me. ‘Run!’ she said, ‘Run!’ I got back to find my whole house on fire with my kids still asleep inside. The house was full of smoke, but they carried on sleeping until they heard all the shouting and screaming from outside. I opened the door and there was nothing but smoke and darkness.” As she rescued her terrified daughters, Akrikez asked herself whether her devotion to the campaign to get the power back on was getting out of hand. “I said to myself, ‘What the fuck am I doing? My daughters are going to die and I’m still fighting this fight.’” Her neighbours suggested she call off the march and go and rest. Akrikez, a 36-year-old intercultural mediator whose family have lived in the Cañada Real, which is divided into six sectors, since 1994, refused. “I said, ‘No. We’re not going to cancel it. We’re going over there because my daughters almost died because of a candle because they cut off our power. The march is going ahead’. And it did.” Since then, Akrikez, who founded and leads the Tabadol Association – an organisation that campaigns for the rights of the Moroccan women who live in the Cañada Real – has not stopped fighting. The past two years have included the bitter cold of January 2021, when Filomena brought Madrid’s heaviest snow in 50 years and froze water pipes, and this summer, Spain’s hottest since 1961, when water supplies to sector six once again failed. Frustrated by the lack of action from the five regional authorities that share varying degrees of responsibility for the informal settlement, Akrikez and her neighbours have adapted to survive. “We’ve normalised something that isn’t normal; we’ve normalised living without power in these conditions,” she says. “When it all began, we thought it wouldn’t last long, that it would be sorted in a few months.” Those who could bought petrol generators, which yielded four hours of electricity for €5 (£4.40) of fuel, or invested in solar panels. Those who could not burned wood and cardboard. And the 1,800 children who live in the area adapted, learning to do their homework by torchlight or candlelight or in the family car. During the pandemic, those trying to keep up with online classes hiked up the hill where the mobile coverage is half-decent. Others stopped going to school because they could no longer endure being bullied about their hygiene. The sufferings have not gone unnoticed inside or outside Spain. In December 2020, a group of UN experts warned the Spanish government that the lack of electricity not only violated the children’s right to adequate housing, it was aslo “having a very serious effect on their rights to health, food, water, sanitation and education”. Ángel Gabilondo, the former socialist education minister who now serves as Spain’s public ombudsman, is equally blunt, describing what is happening in the Cañada Real as “an unsustainable humanitarian emergency situation”. He does not deny the complexity of the issues involved, such as the long-planned rehousing of many Cañada Real residents. “But while all that’s important, to be honest I don’t think that’s the problem,” says Gabilondo. “I think when you have a situation of extreme necessity, what you need to sort out immediately is the [electricity] supply. When that’s been done, you can carry on with the whole rehousing process and with checking the planning situation. I don’t think there’s any excuse for that not to happen.” There is a note of exasperation in his voice as he looks ahead to winter and the attendant sense of deja vu. “The thing is that winter’s coming and when it does, all of us will bemoan the situation,” said Gabilondo. “But bemoaning it and commiserating about it isn’t enough. “We need action. Let’s get the electricity back on and then let’s have whatever debates people want. But it has to be in that order.” The central government’s Madrid delegation says it is working with the regional government and the relevant local authorities to find social housing for those who want to leave the Cañada Real. It also says it speaks regularly with NGOs, local organisations – and Naturgy – “to try to alleviate the needs of Cañada residents while the rehousing takes place”. The regional government has blamed the continuing lack of power on illegal cannabis farms in the Cañada Real that, it says, crash the electricity supplies. Its environment and housing department – which estimates there are more than 3,000 dangerous, illegal power connections in the affected area – also says it is working to meet people’s needs, adding: “Anyone with a problem because of the electricity can resolve it by consulting municipal social services.” Such words do not reassure Akrikez, who is sick of broken promises and of the stigma attached to the Cañada Real because of the actions of the drug dealers who conduct their trade along one of her sector’s six kilometres. Why does she think the authorities have failed the predominantly north African and Gypsy people who live in the Cañada Real? “Because what they care about is this land and its value,” she says. “The Cañada Real is a juicy piece of land when it comes to big urban projects. I would be furious if I left here only to find, a few years later, that it’s been turned into a luxury development with huge houses. And there’s also the fact that we’re foreigners that don’t belong in this society or Gypsies, who’ve always been rejected and stigmatised.” She has no intention of leaving the house that her father built, brick by brick, on the plot he bought for the equivalent today of €20,000. Like many of her neighbours, she wants to stay and to be allowed to pay for her electricity supply and to have a contract like any other customer. Five minutes’ walk from Akrikez’s house, with its solar panels and neat row of butane cylinders, live some of her Gypsy friends. Yolanda and her extended family live in a small compound and subsist by collecting and selling cardboard from a dilapidated transit van. Their budget runs to a puny generator that cannot possibly meet the needs of the 30 or so people who depend on it. Even on a mild, late September day, Yolanda’s house is cold. Two little boys warm themselves by the open fireplace in the corner while Yolanda’s two-month-old grandson dozes on a bed nearby. In the next room, her 62-year-old father-in-law lies asleep on a mattress on the floor. Close to him is the sleep apnoea machine and mask that cannot be plugged in because of the lack of power. “I just don’t know how to explain it,” says Yolanda, 39. “The baby hasn’t been vaccinated because he’d caught a cold. The kids are ill because it’s either too hot or too cold. There’s no light and no hot water and all we have is a fireplace. They need to do something. We need light.” Yolanda’s mother-in-law, María, holds out her raw hands and points to the stone where she does the family’s washing and to the put-upon, useless generator. “This is hell,” she says. “And this is Spain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is too costly, too slow, so it’s zero use to Australia’s emissions plan | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","fields":{"bodyText":"The catch-22 of nuclear power in Australia is that you would only consider it if you wanted to reduce emissions because of climate change, but if you agree climate change is real and we need to reduce emissions, you would not consider nuclear power. Currently Australia burns a lot of coal – more than other comparable economies with nuclear power. If the graph does not display click here Even worse, Victoria relies greatly on the dirtiest and least-efficient brown coal. If the graph does not display click here But if you think climate change is a load of bunk then, as current head of charging with ChargeFox, Evan Beaver, puts it in his excellent blog post on the issue, “we might as well burn all the coal we have. And we have a lot.” But if you do agree climate change is real then what we need to do is reduce emissions as fast as possible. As I noted last month, at a certain point there will be so much CO2 in the atmosphere that we won’t be able to limit temperatures rising above either 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, no matter when we get to net zero afterwards. If the graph does not display click here We must cut emissions fast – at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and probably by about 75% if we want to limit temperature rises to less than 1.5C. Nuclear power is of zero use on that score. We know this because nuclear power has already been examined a lot. One excellent study was in 2006 under the Howard government, by Ziggy Switkowski. It noted that “the earliest that nuclear electricity could be delivered to the grid would be 10 years, with 15 years more probable”. Alright then. Firstly, not even the National party is insane enough to make nuclear power an election promise. So let’s assume if the Coalition wins next year’s election, but announces a move to legalise nuclear power, that even with the best intentions, given the task of getting the votes, it’d be lucky for that to happen until the end of 2022. Now all that has to happen is choose the type of reactor, and oh, pick a spot (have fun). Ignore the coming election in 2025 and assume everything gets in place by 2024 (not a hope, but hey, let’s play pretend). That means at best we’re looking at 2035 but more likely 2040 before the first nuclear plant comes on line. That is already too late to help prevent temperatures reaching 2C, and by then an overwhelming amount of our electricity will already be generated by renewables. That means the need for such a plant is gone. Markets know this, which is why no one will ever invest in such a plant here. The CSIRO’s latest “GenCost” report suggests the capital costs of small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear power plants by 2030 and even out to 2050 will be greater than renewables, including solar thermal plants. If the graph does not display click here But perhaps rather surprising is that nuclear becomes even less viable when the CSIRO projects the world getting to net zero by 2050. If the graph does not display click here The reason is that, under such a scenario, the push for renewables accelerates so greatly that the development of nuclear power effectively stalls, meaning Australia would have to be a leading investor in new plants – thus paying the first mover costs. As the CSIRO notes, “a major source of discomfort” for nuclear stakeholders is that the high cost estimate of nuclear power “is of theoretical value only” because “a nuclear SMR plant is not planned to be built in Australia anytime soon”. The CSIRO suggests “it is more likely that Australia would only take up nuclear SMR, if at all, from around 2030, after other countries have brought down the cost”. If the world moves to net zero by 2050, those costs will not be brought down. Even once up and running, CSIRO estimates, the price of electricity generation from nuclear power in order to meet all its costs including a return to investment would at best be little better than solar thermal, and much above wind and solar panels. If the graph does not display click here This is not new. The South Australian government conducted a royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle in 2016 and concluded that “a nuclear power plant of currently available size at current costs of construction would not be viable in the South Australian market”. Even the Switkowski report in 2006 suggested that nuclear power would only “become economic” with a carbon price of “approximately $15-$40/t CO2”. And that was in 2006. The SA royal commission considered the case where a carbon price was implemented in 2017 designed to reduce emissions to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 and with “complete decarbonisation by 2050”. Even though this “significantly increased the wholesale price of electricity”, it concluded nuclear power remained unviable. I have no problems with nuclear power. But the only way it would be viable is with an extremely high carbon price. I say bring that on! Except a high carbon price makes renewables an even better investment, and thus nuclear less needed. And even a high carbon price won’t get enough nuclear plants built soon enough to prevent temperatures rising above 2C. Nuclear power: too costly, and too slow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/17/people-who-move-together-the-social-power-of-house-dance","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘People who move together’: the social power of house dance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/17/people-who-move-together-the-social-power-of-house-dance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/17/people-who-move-together-the-social-power-of-house-dance","fields":{"bodyText":"The closure of dance floors around the world during the Covid lockdowns didn’t harm the popularity of house and dance music. Instead it had a creative resurgence, as heard in albums such as Lady Gaga’s Chromatica and Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, which gave an escapist sense of dancing in the clubs. Both musicians said they wanted to give people happiness during challenging times. House dance moves, too, boomed in popularity. The tutorials given by Mike Bredy AKA “Noodles” on TikTok went viral. Like many, I couldn’t stop smiling while practising as Bredy demonstrated basic steps such as the jumping, stomping “farmer” or the “skate” with its side-to-side leg and arm movements. Bredy, a 44-year-old New York native, Switzerland-based dancer and teacher, decided to provide a moment of fun for people to get through the pandemic – “even if it was just for one minute”. It’s been observed that during times of significant world change, the popularity of house music peaks as people look for a way to release all their pent-up stress and energy on the dance floor. Think of the German youth dancing during the fall of the Berlin Wall, inspired by the tunes that came out of 1980s Detroit and Chicago, or LGBTQ people finding a family in the face of marginalisation in society. House music and dance have accompanied recent protests such as the Freedom to Dance rally in London in the summer of 2021, to encourage the lifting of Covid restrictions in the music and hospitality sectors. At the global Black Lives Matter demonstrations against police brutality and racism in 2020, people sometimes danced to the Electric Slide, a 22-step sequence incorporating the grapevine move. Such dances bring forth messages of community to those who are thought of as outsiders. “The way we communicate on the dance floor is non-verbal, and this is part of why it’s so important to society as it provides other ways of being together than our day-to-day lives allow,” says Ruth Pethybridge, a senior lecturer in dance at the University of Falmouth. “Relationships and communities are created between people who move together.” Pethybridge believes that house dance, a form of social freestyle dance, enables people to create their own signature styles through its high levels of improvisation and wide variety of stylistic influences. These include African dance (the rhythmic sounds of the drums, footwork and movement of the torso in harmony with the music); Caribbean and Afro-Latino dance; and Brazilian martial arts capoeira with its graceful acrobatic movements. Other influences include jazz, tap and voguing combined with fast and intricate footwork, jacking, lofting and floorwork similar to breakdancing. This mixture “is part of what makes it a community that can welcome difference and is often associated with ideas of freedom,” says Pethybridge. House dance emerged from Chicago and New York clubs in the late 1970s and 80s as a descendant of the post-disco era. DJs were experimenting with new ways of mixing and remixing records to keep people dancing for extended periods. House dance was freeing, intuitive and unrestricted as it exists and evolves as a social practice rather than having set rules to follow, which can be the case in ballet and ballroom. Such formalised styles of dance incorporate technical systems and are designed for performance. Comparable to the disco genre, house is a counterculture transcending sexual and racial identity. Sekou Heru, a 53-year-old dancer and choreographer, started out as a B-boy at the age of 10 and moved to New York aged 17 to pursue a career in the mecca of dance. At that time, says Heru, most of the trendy clubs that played house music had drag queens on the door. “They were the closest things to knowing that you were going to be safe as they would read people at the door and deny access to certain people.” House dance spread around the US mainly due to the New York dancers who went to universities in places such as Baltimore and Washington DC, bringing club music with them and forming house music and dance communities. Heru now teaches house dance around the world with a method he created called Rhythmmetrics which combines dance, fitness, martial arts and “sacred geometry”. Like other forms of street and social dance, house dance remains popular due to its ability to take different forms as our world becomes ever more interconnected – as demonstrated by the Haitian-Canadian record producer and DJ Kaytranada with his unique fusion of dance, house, electronic and hip-hop music, as well as the dancers who bring their own hybrid experiences to the dance floors. “Dance styles like house resist becoming too fixed and institutionalised, meaning they have endless potential to evolve and change,” says Pethybridge. “Which is surely what we need for society too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/22/xi-jinping-tightens-grip-on-power-as-chinas-communist-party-elevates-his-status","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-22T05:17:11Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping tightens grip on power as China’s Communist party elevates his status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/22/xi-jinping-tightens-grip-on-power-as-chinas-communist-party-elevates-his-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/22/xi-jinping-tightens-grip-on-power-as-chinas-communist-party-elevates-his-status","fields":{"bodyText":"China’s president, Xi Jinping, has strengthened his power as leader and elevated his status within Communist party (CCP) history, with major political resolutions announced on the final day of a key political meeting. On Saturday, the CCP congress approved amendments to its constitution, including the “Two Establishes” and “Two Safeguards”, aimed at enshrining Xi as at the core of the party and his political thought as its underpinning ideology. A list of reappointed delegates also confirmed the premier, Li Keqiang, would be retiring from politics, along with several other senior party figures. Analysts said their exclusion was a strong sign that the next politburo standing committee (PSC), to be unveiled on Sunday, would be dominated by Xi’s allies and his power would be further consolidated. Xi, 69, began his closing speech around midday, as party officials announced the confirmation of the amendments, which all but confirmed that Xi would remain in power for another term. He is widely expected to be reaffirmed this weekend as the party’s general secretary, paving the way for him to gain a norm-breaking third term as Chinese president. “Dare to struggle, dare to win, bury your heads and work hard. Be determined to keep forging ahead,” he told those gathered. Thousands of CCP delegates, ostensibly representing the tens of millions of party members, are meeting in Beijing. The purpose is largely to rubber-stamp reshuffles of senior party positions and constitutional changes likely to have been decided long before the meeting began. The meeting is highly choreographed and mostly behind closed doors. However, shortly before Xi’s speech began, former leader Hu Jintao was escorted out of the room without explanation. Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has further consolidated his individual power, including spearheading the elimination of term limits in 2018. Before those changes, Xi would have been stepping down as leader this week, but instead has the potential to be leader for life. Analysts are watching this weekend’s events keenly, to see if Xi is also formally given the title of People’s Leader, an honorific not officially used since Mao Zedong. There has also been speculation that the role of party chairman could be reinstated. Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the Soas China Institute, said acquiring the title of People’s Leader would put Xi “in a different league”. “He is the supreme leader of China by virtue of being the leader of the CCP, whether that office is styled general secretary or chairman,” said Tsang. “But … the People’s Leader cannot have a term limit and removing one from such a position is ‘anti-people’.” Giving Xi the title would signal that Xi was “untouchable”, Tsang added, “and in effect to be honoured and treated as a demigod”. “It [would] elevate him to least a position comparable to Mao, as the Great Helmsman.” On Saturday, delegates also voted to endorse Xi’s “work report” delivered at the congress’s opening last Sunday, which passed assessment on the previous term and outlined the direction of the new one. At its conclusion the congress also confirmed the re-election of about 200 elite central committee members, who have voting rights within the party. The list of names released on Saturday afternoon included just 11 women. It also did not include several party veterans, including four current members of the PSC. Those missing included Li and Wang Yang, who heads the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. Li was expected to retire from the premiership in March but whether he would fully retire from the CCP leadership framework was the subject of intense speculation. Wang, a pro-reform politician with a relatively liberal image and rich regional experience, was previously seen by analysts as a likely candidate for the next premiership. Analysts have said the departure of both men would be a signal that the new PSC is likely to be stacked with Xi loyalists. Both were eligible to continue serving under the party’s unofficial age limits. “A central committee, politburo and standing committee dominated by Xi would mean a significant loss of checks and balances. Xi’s policy of putting ideology and national security over economic development will continue for the coming five or even 10 years as he is eager to rule until the 22nd party congress in 2032 when he will be 79,” said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based thinktank. Two others who were missing from the list – the National People’s Congress chair, Li Zhanshu, and the vice-premier, Han Zheng – had been expected to step down. The new central committee is responsible for electing the 25-member politburo, of which the seven most powerful are appointed to the PSC. The lineup of the PSC, including the No 1-ranked general secretary, will be revealed on Sunday. The revelation, usually by the PSC members filing out on stage in order of rank, will be the official confirmation of Xi’s retention of the general secretary position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/23/yes-putin-might-use-nuclear-weapons-we-need-to-plan-for-scenarios-where-he-does","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T16:30:39Z","webTitle":"Yes, Putin might use nuclear weapons.

A war that was for months mired in crushing artillery fire had suddenly opened up. Russian forces, outmaneuvered by the Ukrainian army, fled, again proving weaker than anyone expected. Hopes lifted that Ukraine could win the war and force their tormentor back to the prewar battlelines – and perhaps further. Russia shared the same assessment. Vladimir Putin knows his military is badly damaged and getting weaker. The Russian president responded with military mobilization and preparations to annex the Ukrainian regions Russia now controls, just as he did in Crimea in 2014. He also threatened to use nuclear weapons to “protect Russia” – implying he may use them to defend the regions he is annexing. Meanwhile, Ukraine, emboldened by the success of its Kharkiv operation, wants advanced tanks and other new weapons systems from the west. In the face of Putin’s wanton disregard for human life and reckless nuclear threats, they may well get them. No one should conclude that Putin would use a nuclear weapon just because he threatened to do so – the credibility of his words alone is nil. His nuclear saber-rattling is condemnable, and Joe Biden rightly attacked it on Sunday and again at the United Nations on Wednesday. The president is also right to maintain ambiguity about how the United States might respond if Russia detonated a nuclear weapon. But just because Putin has threatened nuclear attack doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Sadly, it isn’t that hard to see a path to nuclear use from here. There are many variants, but the basic story goes something like this: Western support to Ukraine increases this autumn, with new weapons systems and larger quantities of the weapons already deployed. Western intelligence gives the Ukrainians an even sharper edge against a Russian force that is large but poorly trained, under-equipped and demoralized. The Russian military takes heavy losses. It’s routed from one of the Ukrainian regions it has annexed. In this scenario, Putin’s grand project is now collapsing once and for all. Protests in Russia intensify. He fears losing his grip on power and being dragged, Gaddafi-like, through the streets. So he strikes Ukrainian forces with a tactical nuclear weapon in a gamble to underscore the risks, stop the war, and avert disaster for himself. His aim is not to gain a military advantage, but to raise the stakes so high that western capitals are forced to rethink their strategy. After that, de-escalation would be hard. The United States and Nato nuclear powers would come under pressure for a nuclear strike of their own – probably on Russia itself, due to a lack of other options. With its conventional forces in disarray, Russia’s likely response to this strike would be to broaden the nuclear conflict to Nato. The US might try to avoid such an escalating nuclear scenario by deploying a large conventional US force to Ukraine, but this would be almost as escalatory from Russia’s perspective as a Nato nuclear attack. Even if such a strategy did work to de-escalate, the nuclear taboo is broken, and with it, the possibility that other despots use nuclear weapons in the future is much higher. The whole world should want to avert this scenario. The United States and its allies need to deploy all the leverage they can – carrots as well as sticks – to get China, India, and other G20 countries to condemn Russia’s nuclear threat. The tepid reception Putin got from India and China earlier this week seems like a sign these rising powers understand the stakes for their own futures. China is conflicted about Ukraine because it views Russia’s operation there through the lens of its own aims for Taiwan. But Beijing should still appreciate the disastrous consequences a nuclear conflict – even if contained to Europe – would have for its economic future. Peer pressure alone, however, is not likely to be enough. Biden should also find a way to reinforce that the US is not aiming to oust Putin – although it may be difficult to make this case convincing given the extensive sanctions regime, Biden’s own statements about Putin, and the past US record of overthrowing despots. A ceasefire would help to calm the situation and avoid further escalation, but convincing the Ukrainians to accept one is going to be extremely hard now that they have the momentum on the battlefield. Russia’s disastrous plan to annex the regions makes negotiations all the less appealing because it effectively takes these regions off the table. Western capitals should at least point out to Ukrainian leaders that their prospects of retaking all their territory may not be as bright as they hope. There is a very long way to go – their operation in Kharkiv was dramatic, but only bought them back a fraction of their territory. Whether it can be replicated for the remainder is uncertain. At a minimum, now is not the time to offer the Ukrainians advanced new weapons systems. Putin has presented the world with impossible choices. Russia must emerge from this crisis chastened for its recklessness. But in the next few weeks, leaders need to find offramps to prevent the worst. This will take maximum flexibility and creativity from all sides.

The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, is in Australia to discuss Australia’s purchase of nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus deal, meeting with foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in Adelaide on Monday. Grossi has set up a taskforce to investigate the safeguards and legal implications of the deal, under which Australia will buy the boats from either the United States or the United Kingdom. The agency must ensure Australia will not breach the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and there are global concerns that other states will seek to follow Australia’s move to have nuclear submarines. A reactor on a military submarine is impossible for the IAEA to monitor as it does other reactors, and ill-intentioned states could conceivably try to use that lack of transparency to gain reactors and channel the technology into nuclear weapons. Grossi said Australia’s “special arrangement” was necessary because with naval nuclear submarines out at sea for many months, he “can’t send another vehicle to chase it and inspect it”. “Not surprisingly, the consideration around Aukus and the project to give Australia nuclear naval propulsion has been at the centre of the conversation,” he said. “I got a very clear commitment about Australia’s unwavering commitment to, and support of, non-proliferation and the need for us to work together. “This is a technologically challenging project that will require very specific arrangements between us and Australia.’” Grossi said they were at the very initial steps of the project as the exact submarine had not even been chosen yet, and that the agency would ensure there were “no loopholes or proliferation escapes that would allow for this material or part of it to be deviated or lost”. He said he was “absolutely confident about the commitment of the country” to nuclear non-proliferation, but that the technical details had to be worked out for the whole process to be approved. “Then, we will have to see. The political commitment of the government is indispensable. We have that,” he said. “Now we have to go down to the technical [and legal] work, and it will only be once we see eye to eye on every technical aspect.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It was Grossi’s first official visit as director general to Australia. A meeting with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is also scheduled. Wong and Grossi also discussed nuclear proliferation “challenges” in Iran and North Korea. North Korea has been carrying out nuclear weapons tests while Iran is accused of testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear payloads. “The work of the IAEA to contribute to global peace and security has never been more important, or more urgent,” Wong said. “We discussed the IAEA’s central role in addressing nuclear proliferation challenges in Iran and North Korea. And I underlined Australia’s strong support for the IAEA’s work to assist Ukraine and deal with the serious nuclear safety implications of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion. “I reiterated Australia’s total commitment to our obligations under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty.” Wong said she also “reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to working transparently and openly with the IAEA to ensure our acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines sets the highest possible non-proliferation standards”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jan/03/five-nations-pledge-avoid-nuclear-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-03T19:54:34Z","webTitle":"Five of world’s most powerful nations pledge to avoid nuclear war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/five-nations-pledge-avoid-nuclear-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/03/five-nations-pledge-avoid-nuclear-war","fields":{"bodyText":"Five of the world’s most powerful nations have agreed that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” in a rare joint pledge to reduce the risk of such a conflict ever starting. The pledge was signed by the US, Russia, China, the UK and France, the five nuclear weapons states recognised by the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) who are also the five permanent members of the UN security council. They are known as the P5 or the N5. Such a common statement on a major issue of global security has become a rarity at a time of increasing friction between Russia, China and the west. With Moscow threatening to invade Ukraine and China signaling its readiness to use military force against Taiwan, the joint statement represents a renewed commitment to prevent any confrontation turning into a nuclear catastrophe. A senior US state department official said the wording of the statement had been hammered out at P5 meetings over several months, despite the high-tension environment. “At the base level to be able to say that this is how we think about these risks, and this is an acknowledgement that it is something that we want to avoid, particularly during a difficult time, I think is noteworthy,” the official said. The release of the statement had been timed to coincide with the five-yearly review conference of the NPT, but that conference has been postponed amid the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, and disagreements on whether the session could be held virtually. “We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,” the statement said, echoing a joint declaration by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at a 1985 summit in Geneva. The NPT was a bargain between states without nuclear weapons, who pledged not to acquire them, and the five nuclear-armed states, which promised to disarm. The review conference, originally planned for 2020, was expected to be contentious as a result of the stalling of momentum towards disarmament and the moves made by the five weapons states to modernise their arsenals. Four other countries with nuclear weapons not recognised under NPT – Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea – have also shown no signs of reducing their stockpiles. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the deadlock so far in attempts to salvage it, have raised the risks of nuclear proliferation, particularly in the Middle East. Monday’s joint statement was aimed at improving the atmosphere at the NPT review conference. China’s vice-foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, welcomed Monday’s statement as “positive and weighty”, adding it would “help increase mutual trust and replace competition among major powers with coordination and cooperation”. It took several months of negotiation over the wording of the declaration before all five powers were ready to agree. France in particular had concerns that such a statement would undermine the deterrent effect of its arsenal. “France has a nuclear doctrine reserving the right to use nuclear weapons as a “final warning” to warn off an aggressor or even a state sponsor of terrorism”, said Oliver Meier, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy. Meier said the UK’s reservations were not so clearly expressed but he believed them to be similar. A line in the joint statement saying that “nuclear weapons – for as long as they continue to exist – should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war,” was added to address French concerns. The five nuclear weapons powers also stated that the “reduction of strategic risks”, making sure global tensions never lead to nuclear conflict, was one of their “foremost responsibilities”. “We underline our desire to work with all states to create a security environment more conducive to progress on disarmament,” the statement said. A senior US official said the declaration was the result “of a good and substantive and constructive conversation about how to reduce nuclear threats and eventually eliminate them”. “Given the security environment, I’m pretty shocked that the P5 could agree to this much,” Heather Williams, a senior lecturer in defence studies at King’s College London, said. Williams and other nuclear experts have urged the nuclear weapons powers to improve their channels of crisis communications as one of the ways of reducing risks of an unplanned clash escalating into nuclear conflict. Arms control advocates widely welcomed the declaration but called for it to be backed up by a return to disarmament. “With nine nuclear arsenals currently being enhanced, and Covid problems besetting nuclear-armed submarines and facilities, this statement from five of the nuclear-armed leaders is welcomed, but does not go far enough,” said Rebecca Johnson, the vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the first president of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “As long as nuclear weapons continue to be advertised and wielded by some, we are all put at risk of nuclear war.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/01/unless-ministers-listen-treasury-truth-to-power-will-not-prevent-further-crises","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-01T20:00:17Z","webTitle":"Unless ministers listen, Treasury truth to power will not prevent further crises | David Gauke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/01/unless-ministers-listen-treasury-truth-to-power-will-not-prevent-further-crises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/01/unless-ministers-listen-treasury-truth-to-power-will-not-prevent-further-crises","fields":{"bodyText":"The Treasury is an institution with a sense of history.

The “pound in your pocket” devaluation of November 1967, the expansionary “Barber boom” initiated by the budget of March 1972, the IMF bailout of September 1976 and our ejection from the ERM in September 1992 will be all too familiar as case studies of failure from which lessons should be learned. To add to that list – perhaps the worst of the lot – will be Kwasi Kwarteng’s economic statement of 23 September 2022. Culpability, of course, lies with ministers. A chancellor of the exchequer should have a feel for what the market will tolerate and the sense not to push their luck. Nonetheless, it would be no surprise if there is some soul-searching among senior officials as to whether more could have been done to warn the politicians that £45bn of unfunded tax cuts would break the markets’ patience. It did not help, of course, that their boss – Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar – had just been sacked for being insufficiently positive. A willingness to tell truth to power is always necessary but it is particularly essential at the moment. We are not through this crisis yet. The currency and gilt markets remain jittery and, with the Conservative party conference commencing in Birmingham , every word said by the prime minister and chancellor will be closely scrutinised to see if they fully comprehend the situation. The evidence so far is not encouraging. For much of the past week, ministers have attempted to deny that the market turbulence was the direct result of Kwarteng’s statement. They have also blamed the markets for failing to appreciate what they believe will be the truly awesome impacts of their growth policies. As for addressing the new hole in the public finances that has been created, the government’s answer is simply to cut spending. Departments will have to “trim the fat” and reduce the welfare budget. The Treasury is going to have to inject some realism into ministers’ thinking. Denying the obvious – that the turmoil stems from Kwarteng’s statement – will only unsettle the markets. The first step on the road to recovery is to recognise the problem. There are some good proposals in the government’s growth plan but none of them will be immediately transformative, and the most economically positive – increasing immigration and liberalising planning law – are so controversial that they might not happen. In any event, the higher interest rates that have resulted from recent market turmoil will weaken economic growth in the next couple of years. Assuming that the markets have underestimated the government’s supply-side policies would be foolish. As for thinking that the public finances can be put on a sustainable footing solely by taking an axe to public spending, a moment’s thought about the implications reveals that this is not credible. Reducing benefits during a cost of living crisis while cutting taxes on those with the highest incomes; reducing expenditure on the NHS during a winter that is likely to be particularly tough; substantially reducing real-terms public sector pay at a time of full employment: none of these policies is sustainable. The immediate task for Treasury officials is to disabuse ministers of their delusions. They will have assistance – the Office for Budget Responsibility will tell some economic home truths, Conservative MPs are already setting out the political realities – but they may not have long. While ministers refuse to face up to reality, the risk of a further crisis in market confidence remains.

Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, met the outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi, for a formal handover ceremony on Sunday. “I did not expect this welcome,” Meloni, 45, said as she was greeted by Draghi, referring to the ceremonial guard. “It’s an emotionally impacting thing.” The pair held private talks for over an hour before Draghi handed Meloni a small symbolic bell used during cabinet debates. The new prime minister’s government, a coalition that includes Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, then swiftly began its first cabinet meeting. “United to deal with the country’s emergencies,” Meloni said. The coalition won the general election on 25 September on promises of steep tax cuts, pension increases, cracking down on illegal immigration and defending the traditional family. But the path towards forming a government was marked by clashes over key ministerial posts and simmering rivalries between Meloni and Berlusconi, the three-time former prime minister, especially after he was recorded telling Forza Italia parliamentarians that he blamed Ukraine for the war with Russia and had rekindled his friendship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Before receiving her mandate, Meloni, who has herself praised Putin in the past, reiterated that her government would be ardently pro-Nato and that anyone who rejected that “cannot be part of the government”. Shielding households from rising inflation and the surge in energy prices brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are among the prime minister’s most pressing tasks, leaving her significantly short of the financial resources required to fulfil election campaign resources. According to La Repubblica newspaper, during a meeting last week about Italy’s 2023 budget, which needs to be sent to Brussels for approval by the end of October, Meloni told close officials after realising she doesn’t have much room to manoeuvre on expenditure: “Other than the march on Rome, I will need to march on Gazprom.” The beginning of Meloni’s government coincides with the 100th anniversary, on 28 October, of Benito Mussolini and his armed fascist troops marching from Milan to Rome “to take by the throat our miserable ruling class”. Two days later, King Vittorio Emanuele III handed him power. Meloni received congratulatory messages from world leaders after being sworn in on Saturday, including the US president, Joe Biden, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who said she had a “a good call” with Meloni after she took office, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Meloni and Salvini, who is deputy prime minister, were also congratulated by their European far-right allies. “This is a great day for the European right!” the Hungarian prime minister, Victor Orbàn, wrote on Twitter. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said: “Patriots everywhere in Europe are coming to power and with them this Europe of Nations that we are hoping for.” The first foreign leader Meloni will reportedly meet, either on Sunday or Monday, is the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who is in Rome for an event organised by the Catholic charity Sant’Egidio. “I am ready to work with her,” Macron said on Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/mar/15/hilary-embling-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T22:35:20Z","webTitle":"Hilary Embling obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/15/hilary-embling-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/mar/15/hilary-embling-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My mother, Hilary Embling, who has died aged 94, was a teacher, librarian, peace campaigner and leftwing activist. Born in the town of Croydon to Margaret (nee Bingham) and Graham Down, a bank manager, Hilary was the youngest of five daughters. During the second world war she was a day girl at a private boarding school near Croydon and lived with her grandmother. The rest of the family had moved to Bognor Regis, West Sussex, but her father thought she would be safer away from the coast. Always a critical thinker, Hilary broke away from her parents’ values – they were strongly against her radical views. She studied Russian at University College London (1949-53), and, during this period, met David Embling, an architect who worked in social housing, and they married in 1951. The couple joined CND shortly after it was founded and would take me and my siblings on Aldermaston marches. Hilary also took part in many sit-down demonstrations against the Vietnam war. From 1953 to 1965, Hilary was a full-time mother of four children. Once we were all in school, she did a six-week infant induction teaching course, and, from 1966 to 1969, taught part-time in infant schools. In 1971, Hilary qualified as a teacher librarian at UCL, before working part-time at the National Central Library to become a chartered librarian (1974). She then spent a year at Queens’ school, Bushey, in Hertfordshire, before joining the staff of Haverstock school in Camden, north London, in 1975, where she remained until she retired in 1988, aged 60. The family lived in Hampstead from 1960 to 1988, and Hilary would jog across the heath to have a dip in the ladies’ pond before work, then stop off at her allotment on her way home after work. She became a Woodcraft Folk leader (1969-71) and would always offer to be on latrine duty at Woodcraft camps. In the 1980s she volunteered at the CND office in Finsbury Park with Bruce Kent, and participated in demonstrations at Greenham Common. She was arrested a few times for her peace activism, and once refused to pay the fine on principle, so spent four days in Holloway prison. David retired in 1982 and some years later they moved to a farm near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire. Hilary took up riding, a childhood passion, joined U3A and was a hike leader. She planted a woodland of native trees on the land around their house, and volunteered for many years at the Riding for the Disabled Association and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. After David died in 1993, Hilary remained at the farm, hosting people from all over the world, through the organisation, World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. An avid reader of novels, Hilary also wrote poetry and enjoyed knitting – her offspring cherished her stripy jumpers. Hilary is survived by her children, Nicholas, Felicity, Caroline and me, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/12/first-thing-fbi-searched-mar-a-lago-for-nuclear-weapons-documents-say-reports-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T09:40:03Z","webTitle":"First Thing: FBI searched Mar-a-Lago for nuclear weapons papers, say reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/first-thing-fbi-searched-mar-a-lago-for-nuclear-weapons-documents-say-reports-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/first-thing-fbi-searched-mar-a-lago-for-nuclear-weapons-documents-say-reports-trump","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. FBI agents were looking for secret documents about nuclear weapons among other classified material when they searched Donald Trump’s home on Monday, it has been reported. The Washington Post cited people familiar with the investigation as saying nuclear weapons documents were thought to be in the trove the FBI was hunting in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. They did not specify what kind of documents or whether they referred to the US arsenal or another country’s. The report came hours after the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said he had personally authorised the government request for a search warrant and revealed that the justice department had asked a Florida court for the warrant to be unsealed, noting that Trump himself had made the search public. The justice department motion referred to “the public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred in its contents”. What has Trump said about unsealing the search warrant? He said he would not oppose but rather was “encouraging the immediate release of those documents” related to what he called the “unAmerican, unwarranted, and unnecessary raid and break-in … Release the documents now!” Trump has until 3pm ET to officially respond. Is it likely that Trump did take classified nuclear weapons documents with him when he left the White House? This is not known but Trump was particularly fixated on the US nuclear arsenal while he was in the White House, and boasted about being privy to highly secret information. Al Gore hails Biden’s historic climate bill as ‘a critical turning point’ America’s passing of its first climate legislation will prove a pivotal moment that will help bring to an end the era of fossil fuels, according to Al Gore, the former US vice-president. Joe Biden is poised to sign a $370bn package of clean energy spending, overcoming decades of American political rancor and inaction on the climate crisis. Gore said he was now sure the fossil fuel industry and its political backers would not be able to reverse the shift to a decarbonized world, even if Republicans are able to wrest back control of Congress or the White House. “In crossing this threshold we have changed history and will never go backwards,” Gore told the Guardian in an interview. “I’m extremely optimistic that this will be a critical turning point in our struggle to confront the climate crisis.” While the oil and gas industry is currently making enormous profits off the back of soaring fuel prices spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Gore insisted this was “momentary compared to the big wheel that is now turning” on renewable energy. Will the legislation pass? The legislation narrowly passed the US Senate on Sunday and is expected to ease through the House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, today before being signed by Biden. Anne Heche not expected to survive car crash, actor’s family says The family of Anne Heche say the US actor is “not expected to survive” after a severe collision that left her vehicle engulfed in flames last Friday. In a statement, Heche’s family said through a representative that she had “a severe anoxic brain injury” and was now being kept on life support to determine whether her organs were viable for donation. The family said it had “long been her choice” to donate her organs. “We want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers for Anne’s recovery and thank the dedicated staff and wonderful nurses that cared for Anne at the Grossman Burn Center at West Hills hospital,” the statement read. “Unfortunately, due to her accident, Anne Heche suffered a severe anoxic brain injury and remains in a coma, in critical condition. She is not expected to survive.” Heche, 53, is known for her work on films including the remake of Psycho, Donnie Brasco and Cedar Rapids. What happened to her? Heche crashed her car into a house in the Mar Vista area of Los Angeles, near her own home, at speed on Friday. The collision caused a fire that took an hour to extinguish, according to reports.

Stat of the day: Nearly 8,000 Canadians were dying early each year from outdoor air pollution, study finds A study in one of the cleanest countries in the world could help governments think about future ways to manage air pollution. Census records for more than 7 million Canadians from between 1981 and 2016 were combined with air pollution data to find out whether small amounts of particle pollution were harmful. Despite the relatively clean air, the study found that nearly 8,000 Canadians were dying early each year from outdoor air pollution. Notably, even people in the cleanest areas were experiencing an impact on their health. Don’t miss this: Scientists look at why mental exertion triggers exhaustion It’s a familiar feeling on a Friday evening. After finishing a gruelling day’s work, you finally agree with friends on where to meet for a night out. But by the time you have figured out what to wear and where you left your keys, a night on the sofa begins to sound more appealing than one on the tiles. Now, scientists think they may be able to explain why you feel so weary before you have even reached the bus stop: your brain has slowed down to manage the strain. The brain could suffer from something similar to the painful buildup of lactate in muscles during physical exercise. … or this: I speak more than 50 languages “At sixth-form college, I completed Spanish GCSE, then A-level.

I’ve been described as one of the UK’s most multilingual people, which is very sweet. I’ve studied more than 50 languages now. I generally use 15 weekly and more than 30 in a year.” Climate check: An anxious American west sizes up historic climate bill The passage of the historic US climate legislation this weekend sparked renewed hope in environmental circles and even tears of joy in Congress. Many who have spent decades on the frontlines feel that despite its imperfections, the landmark federal funding opens up new frontiers on which to fight in a rapidly changing world. The call to arms rings especially true in the American west, where the devastating effects of the climate crisis – from drought to wildfires to heatwaves – are already hitting home. And there’s little time to waste. Last Thing: Man overcharged 20 rupees for India train ticket wins 22-year legal battle An Indian lawyer has won a 22-year legal battle with Indian Railways for overcharging him by 20 rupees (25c). When Tungnath Chaturvedi, 66, bought a ticket at Mathura station in 1999 to go to Moradabad, he was charged 90 rupees instead of 70. He complained but did not receive a refund. After 100 hearings, the court ruled last week in his favour, ordering the railways to pay a fine, as well as the outstanding amount plus 12% interest. The ruling was sweet vindication for Chaturvedi. “It’s not the money that matters,” he told the BBC. “This was always about a fight for justice and a fight against corruption, so it was worth it.” Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. Speaking to the EU summit via video link, the Ukrainian president’s account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed where the fighting has been fiercest was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired security council, said Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.” Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has now withdrawn its claim Russian troops had left Nova Kahkovka. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, in a rare retraction, said Russian troops remained in the town on the east bank of the Dnipro River. It said the initial report had been issued “as a result of incorrect use of available data” but gave no details. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, had denied the report. The EU has denounced Russian police raids against the Nobel prize-winning human rights group Memorial, describing them as being part of an intimidation and harassment campaign. Reuters, citing Memorial, reports that Russian security forces raided the homes of former employees of the group on Tuesday and took some of them in for questioning. Founded to document political repression in the Soviet Union, Memorial was officially banned in late 2021 after the authorities claimed it supported terrorism and extremism, charges the group called absurd. The spokesperson for the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said: The recent actions by the Russian authorities constitute yet another step in the ongoing intimidation and persecution of independent and critical voices in the Russian society. Memorial’s work in Russia has been invaluable in defence of human rights and against “attempts to manipulate the historical memory of political repression in Russia in the 20th century”, he added. The EU calls upon the Russian authorities to stop the unfounded prosecution and police harassment of Memorial and its staff – and to respect the rule of law. Tuesday’s raids were carried out after Russian investigators accused the now dissolved group of allegedly including the names of second world war-era Nazi collaborators on their historical list of victims of political terror. The raids were condemned by rights groups internationally as well as what remains of Russia’s domestic opposition, Reuters reports. We reported earlier that the Ukrainian military was claiming Russian forces had left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, has denied that. Reuters quotes him as saying on Telegram: All Russian military personnel in Nova Kakhovka, as well as in other locations on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro remain in their place. Russian forces redeployed to the east bank of the Dnipro River last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian athletes will remain barred from track and field “for the foreseeable future” because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said. The International Olympic Committee is exploring a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals at next year’s Olympic Games in Paris. But it appears likely they will not be able to feature in athletics in Paris, arguably the highest-profile Olympic sport. Lord Coe told a press conference: The World Athletics Council approved to continue to exclude Russian and Belarus athletes from all World Series events for the foreseeable future due to the invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine. Russian forces have left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian military’s general staff has said. Reuters quotes its evening report outlining conditions on the front lines as saying: As of 22 March 2023, all units of the occupying army that had been deployed in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region, have left the city. The town is located on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where Russian forces redeployed last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops. The report said Russian troops had stolen appliances, valuables, clothing and mobile telephones from nearby houses as they departed. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) during a ceremony on Thursday. Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. Hungary and Turkey, the only Nato members that have yet to ratify Finland’s membership, have both signalled they will soon do so. European Union leaders have held talks with the UN chief, António Guterres, on sanctions imposed on Russia and are also expected to endorse a plan to supply more artillery shells to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Guterres’ participation in the EU summit, where global food security was also discussed, comes days after the renewal of a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey on the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea that is seen as crucial to overcoming a global food crisis. The 27 EU leaders were also due to get an update on the war from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, via video link. Arriving for the two-day summit, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: We need to ensure that grain exports, for example from Ukraine, can continue. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, spoke against any easing of sanctions on Moscow under the grain deal and called for a tighter price cap on Russian oil exports. The US has pushed back against Russian demands that western sanctions be eased before Moscow allows Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports to continue beyond mid-May, saying there are no restrictions on Russian farm products or fertilisers. Inside the EU, the issue of fertiliser exports is blocking more sanctions against Russia’s ally Belarus. The bloc says new sanctions are needed to stop Belarus from serving as a route to bypass the existing Russia trade restrictions. But Lithuania opposes what it calls “fertiliser oligarch” exemptions proposed to ensure Belarusian fertilisers continue flowing to third countries, arguing that that would weaken the sanctions regime overall, diplomats said. Proponents say such carve-outs, similar to those the EU has in place under its sanctions against Russia, are necessary to ensure food security and refute Moscow’s charge that EU measures – rather than Russia’s invasion – are driving the global crisis. Diplomats involved in preparing the summit were sceptical of any imminent breakthrough. Earlier, William met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at the presidential palace, where they discussed the war in Ukraine. The former’s spokesperson said: The conversation was warm and friendly, and predominantly focused on the ongoing conflict with the war in Ukraine, particularly its impact on Polish society. The Prince of Wales took the opportunity to thank the president and the Polish people who have done so much to support the people of Ukraine who’ve fled here. They discussed the importance of the need for ongoing support to Ukraine and its people. The prince said he was very much looking forward to seeing the president and first lady at the coronation. He also thanked him for attending the late queen’s funeral. William also echoed his grandmother the queen by laying a wreath at a monument dedicated to soldiers. Queen Elizabeth II and the late Duke of Edinburgh did the same during their state visit to Poland in 1996. William was greeted by a guard of honour and carried the assortment of flowers to the monument, spending around 10 minutes there before leaving. On the wreath was a note reading: “In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.” The Prince of Wales has praised the resilience of young Ukrainian refugees living in Poland. William, on the second day of his surprise trip to the country, visited the Hala Koszyki food hall in Warsaw to speak to those who have fled Ukraine. He joined them at tables on Thursday afternoon and heard about their experiences settling into Polish life. William told them: It must be very difficult to start an entire new life in a new country. It’s amazing how resilient you are. That shines out. He also spoke to people who have hosted refugees, and thanked them for their kindness. William was greeted by well-wishers outside the venue and given flowers. Three women held a sign thanking him for the visit. One of them, Olga Mieszejewska-Buchalik, who travelled three hours from south Poland, told reporters: I said that we really appreciated his support for our nation and Ukraine. Vonya Bultruski, 26, who spoke to the prince, told the PA news agency: I told him how much his support for refugees means, he’s a very kind man. I’m very happy to see him in Poland, it is a big moment for my country. Marta Galinska, 47, a milliner, gave William a pink felt hat she made for the Princess of Wales. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. The Ukrainian president was speaking to the EU summit via video link, from a moving train in an undisclosed location in Ukraine, where he recounted news from the frontline. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy visited frontline military positions near the besieged city of Bakhmut, where he met Ukrainian serviceman and held a moment of silence for those killed in the war. Earlier today he was in Kherson region. His account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. On one occasion the secure line cut out, but was soon reconnected. According to an EU source, he warned European leaders of five factors that could prolong the war, including delays in the delivery of long-range missiles, lack of modern aircraft and weaknesses in western sanctions. EU leaders are now discussing the Russian invasion, where they are expected to endorse a decision to supply a million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months to replenish its dwindling stocks. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has this report from Kherson on its official Telegram channel, citing the state emergency department: Four fires broke out in the Kherson region during the day as a result of shelling by the Russian army. A warehouse was on fire in Kherson, a car and the remains of a cable caught fire in Beryslav. And in Antonivka, a private house and a non-residential building were on fire. The office of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have issued a couple of photographs of his visit to Kherson region today. It is Zelenskiy’s second trip outside Kyiv this week, having visited the frontline city of Bakhmut yesterday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, visited the occupied city of Mariupol on Saturday evening in his first trip to one of the areas that Russia has claimed to annex from Ukraine. Medvedev may have dismissed western claims that Russia is running out of weapons with which to continue its war on Ukraine, but Reuters is reporting that the conflict has left Moscow unable to deliver vital defence supplies it had committed to India’s military. New Delhi has been worried about just such a situation, with Moscow its largest source of defence equipment. An Indian air force statement on Thursday is the first official confirmation it has come about. The statement was made to a parliamentary committee, which published it on its website on Tuesday. An air force representative told the committee that Russia had planned a “major delivery” this year that would not take place. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in New Delhi told Reuters: “We don’t have information which may confirm the stated.” There has been no immediate response from Rosoboronexport, which is the Russian government’s weapons export arm. The report does not mention specifics of the delivery, Reuters says. Medvedev also dismissed any suggestion of talks with western European powers as “useless” and spoke contemptuously about western politicians, claiming a “catastrophic drop in competence and elementary literacy of EU leaders”. I have no illusions that we could communicate with them again any time soon. It makes no sense to negotiate with certain countries and blocs – they only understand the language of force. Medvedev, who heads a panel coordinating weapons production, derided western claims that Moscow is running out of weapons and said Russian weapons industries had increased output. He said Russia would produce 1,500 battle tanks this year and boost production of other weapons to meet its army’s needs. His claims could not be independently verified. The most important thing now is to make it all in necessary volumes, and we are launching new factories to do that. He said that the Russian military already had good intelligence drones and loitering munitions, but acknowledged that it had yet to deploy long-range strike drones. Here’s some more detail on those comments made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired Security Council, who we quoted earlier as saying that any attempt to arrest the Russian president would amount to a declaration of war. According to the Associated Press (AP), he has told reporters in Russia that Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer. Medvedev also denounced the ICC’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin as legally null and void, claiming the move added to a “colossal negative potential” in the already bitterly strained ties. Our relations with the west are already worse than they have ever been in history. Medvedev challenged Ukraine’s sovereignty in comments that could reflect Moscow’s plans to extend its gains. Honestly speaking, Ukraine is part of Russia. But, due to geopolitical reasons and the course of history, we had tolerated that we were living in separate quarters and had been forced to acknowledge those invented borders for a long time. The AP reports that, since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, Medvedev has emerged as one of the most hawkish Russian officials, with observers interpreting his position as an apparent attempt to curry favour with Putin. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the southern region of Kherson, where he toured local infrastructure the he promised to restore after Russia’s invasion. The visit, to a region where Ukraine staged a successful counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces late last year, was his second outside Kyiv this week, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, he visited troops near the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut. On Thursday, under footage of his visit to Kherson region that was posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote: I spoke with local residents about their current issues and needs. We will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. Just like with every city and village that suffered because of the occupiers. The Ukrainian counteroffensive last year pushed Russian troops out of the regional capital after months of occupation. Workers in the region are now busy restoring power and the water supply. In a separate post showing him inspecting energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian president wrote: We have to ensure full restoration and protection of our energy sector. I am grateful to everyone who works for this and returns the light to our people. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor has said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. He was speaking to Reuters after meeting the international criminal court (ICC)‘s chief prosecutor in The Hague, where the court is based. Last week, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him and his children’s commissioner of the war crime of deporting children from Ukraine to Russia. While the ICC can prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine, it cannot prosecute the crime of aggression due to legal constraints. International support is growing for the creation of a special tribunal that would prosecute Russian leaders for the 13-month-old invasion itself, considered by Ukraine and western leaders to be a crime of aggression. Kostin said the special tribunal should go after “the highest political and military leadership, including Putin, for the crime of aggression”. I believe that it could be (held) in absentia, because it’s important to deliver a matter of justice for international crimes even if perpetrators are not in the dock. International courts very rarely hold trials in absentia and the ICC’s rules state specifically that an accused suspect shall be present during trial. The only recent example of an international trial in absentia was in the case of Lebanon, for which a UN-backed tribunal convicted three men for the 2005 assassination of Lebanese politician Rafik Hariri. Russia has publicly said it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia in what it presents as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and abandoned children in the conflict zone. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. “We will also talk about Ukraine where the most important thing is to be able to guarantee a stable and lasting peace,” Reuters reports Sanchez told the media in Brussels. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to further squeeze Russia’s revenue. “We know that Russia is earning less from the oil. We see the economic sanctions, including the oil price cap, are having am effect on the Russian economy and their ability to fuel the war machine,” Reuters reports her saying on arriving to talks among the EU’s 27 national leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. “We should continue with that,” she said, adding that Estonia would agree to raise the cap again should oil prices rise. She spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia as sought by Moscow in the grain deal talks. “We shouldn’t weaken the sanctions,” she said. A video is circulating on social media, reported by Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move which is not widely recognised internationally. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. The Guardian has not independently verified the location, or the date the video was made. The air alarm which has been in force across Ukraine for much of the last two hours has ended. Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. The ICC issued an arrest warrant on Friday, accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bore individual criminal responsibility. Reuters reports that the hawkish former president Medvedev told Russian media that the ICC, which countries including Russia, China and the US do not recognise, was a “legal nonentity” that had never done anything significant. Any attempt to detain Putin, though, would be a declaration of war, said Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. “Let’s imagine – obviously this [is a] situation which will never be realised – but nevertheless let us imagine that it was realised: the current head of the nuclear state went to a territory, say Germany, and was arrested,” Medvedev said. “What would that be? It would be a declaration of war on the Russian Federation,” he said in a video posted on Telegram. “And in that case, all our assets – all our missiles – would fly to the Bundestag, to the Chancellor’s office.” Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this news roundup this morning on its official Telegram channel: As a result of an attack by Russian drones [yesterday] on a hostel in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, nine people were killed, the state emergency service reported. Rescue operations are completed. In the middle of the night, the Russian military shelled Kramatorsk in Donetsk region: residential buildings, a boiler house and garages were damaged. On 22 March, shelling in the region killed two people and injured four others. At night, the Russian army shelled the Kherson regional cardio centre; there were no casualties. Fifty-four times during the day, the Russian Federation fired heavy artillery and “Grad missiles” in the Kherson region; one person was killed, two were wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk and Kherson are two of the partly occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, has posted to Telegram to say: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He goes on to write that the enemy is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, [Balakliia] and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. He praised his troops for “superhuman resilience, courage and bravery” under “the continuous fire of the enemy’s artillery and aircraft”. An air alert is being declared across Ukraine. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on the situation in Ukraine. It writes: Since the start of March 2023, heavy fighting has continued in parts of the Svatove-Kremina sector of the frontline in northern Luhansk oblast. Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year. In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres. Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed in fighting there. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country’s unofficial involvement in Ukraine’s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month captured a moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out: “New Zealand! New Zealand!” “My brother!” Te Tai replied. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on March 9, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The statement continues: The situation at the plant remains perilous. The IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) team currently present at the plant was informed that restoration of the line had been planned for 5, 10 and then 13 March but had not been possible. The latest reconnection date is scheduled for 23 March. Six weeks after European leaders last gathered in Brussels, they’re meeting again for two days. The war in Ukraine is high on the agenda (though tensions between France and Germany over nuclear energy and combustion engines loom large) and UN secretary general, António Guterres, will be joining the summit for the first day. Among the items on the agenda over the next two days are, according to the council: Accountability of perpetrators Further increasing collective pressure on Russia The use of frozen assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine Support to help meet Ukraine’s military and defence needs Global food security Address high energy prices Reduce gas demand Ensure security of supply Phase out dependency on Russian fossil fuels Wording on the summit points out that the EU has “made available” €67bn (US$73bn) to Ukraine since the start of the war. That’s equivalent to about 27% of Ukraine’s total GDP for 2021, before Russia invaded. A months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to US, Ukrainian and British military experts. Russian forces unleashed a wave of air strikes in the north and south of Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin bid farewell on Wednesday to Chinese leader Xi Jinping following a two day visit to Moscow by his fellow autocrat and “dear friend”. Bakhmut is the site of Europe’s deadliest infantry battle since World War Two. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said in its most recent update that the pace of Russian operations around Bakhmut “appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions.” The update goes on to say: Russian forces are currently increasing the tempo of their offensive operations around Avdiivka aiming to encircle the settlement, and it is possible that Russian forces are doing so at the expense of their operations around Bakhmut and the stalled offensive around Vuhledar. British military intelligence believes Russia’s assault on the town could be running out of steam. There was still a danger, however, that the Ukrainian garrison in Bakhmut could be surrounded, Britain’s defence ministry said in its intelligence update on Wednesday. Ukraine’s military General Staff agreed that Russia’s offensive potential in Bakhmut was declining. Bakhmut has become a key objective for Moscow, which sees the town as a stepping stone toward completing its conquest of the eastern Donbas region. Hello and welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan taking you through the day’s news. Our top story this morning: Russia’s months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank. In its latest update, the ISW writes, “The tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions”. And the European Council is meeting today in Brussels, where leaders will discuss the war and Europe’s continuing support for Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will also take part in today’s meeting. We’ll bring you the latest on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said China is watching “very carefully” to see how Washington and the world respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the end of president Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow, Blinken said that if Russia was allowed to attack Ukraine with impunity, it would “open a Pandora’s box” for would-be aggressors and lead to a “world of conflict”. He added that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal aid to Moscow. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. At least one person was killed and 33 wounded by a twin Russian missile strike on two residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s east, according to officials. Footage from a security camera captured the moment the strike hit, causing an explosion and a large plume of smoke to rise from two nine-storey buildings. Residential areas “where ordinary people and children live are being fired at”, said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. At least eight people were killed overnight in a drone attack on Rzhyshchiv in the Kyiv region, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said. The strike is reported to have hit a dormitory building and a school. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that one of the people who died was “an ambulance driver who came to the call”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said the risk of a nuclear conflict is at its highest level in decades. Russia was committed to keeping the world “safe and free” from the threat of nuclear war, he said, but added later that business could not continue as usual, given that Moscow was now “in a de facto state of open conflict” with Washington. Rebuilding Ukraine’s economy is now expected to cost $411bn, 2.6 times Ukraine’s expected 2022 gross domestic product, a new study by the World Bank, United Nations, European Commission and Ukraine found. Sweden’s parliament has formally approved a bill to allow the country to join Nato. Sweden and its neighbour Finland applied to join Nato in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The process has been held up by Turkey, which along with Hungary has yet to ratify the memberships. Zelenskiy made a surprise visit on Wednesday to Ukrainian troops near the frontline city of Bakhmut. During his visit, the president heard “reports on the operational situation and the course of hostilities on the frontline”, a statement from his office said. Zelenskiy, dressed in a dark sweatshirt and military khaki trousers, was seen handing out medals to soldiers he said were heroically defending their country’s sovereignty. There is a possibility that the Russian assault on the town of Bakhmut is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. This could be happening because “some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors”, it said. The Prince of Wales travelled to Warsaw as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/28/cuba-hurricane-ian-blackout-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T17:58:20Z","webTitle":"‘We’re natural fighters’: Cubans brave sweeping power cuts in Hurricane Ian aftermath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/28/cuba-hurricane-ian-blackout-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/28/cuba-hurricane-ian-blackout-electricity","fields":{"bodyText":"“Hurricane” is an Indigenous word, used by Cubans long before the Spanish conquistadores arrived. So when Hurricane Ian – with sustained wind speeds of more than 200km/h (124mph) – made a direct hit on the provincial capital of Pinar del Río on Tuesday, people were ready. Just hours after the worst of the storm passed, amid broken glass and lashing winds, hotel worker Nieves Oliva, 60, was even dancing to reggaeton on a battery-powered speaker after a long, wet night guarding the city’s main hotel. “If we don’t have electricity, if there’s no water, if there’s no food , the least we can do is tackle the situation in good spirits,” she said. “We’re natural fighters: we’re Cubans!” For 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) along the main road from Havana, all the lamp posts had been felled. Roofs had been stripped bare of their terracotta tiles, and the thatched wooden huts for drying tobacco which normally line the roadside had been swept away. In the provincial capital, giant cat’s cradles of knotted electrical cables and zinc roof sheets swung between buildings in the wind and rain. Ian not only devastated Pinar del Río, killing at least two people and leaving the country’s finest tobacco fields sodden, it brought on a nationwide disaster: by demolishing critical energy infrastructure it caused a blackout across the entire island – at a time when millions of Cubans were already living through daily power cuts. “Hurricane Ian hit Cuba at a very vulnerable moment,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington DC. “The electrical grid was already failing due to obsolete equipment, poor maintenance and a shortage of fuel for powerplants. “In the past several months there have been several dozen neighbourhood protests over electrical blackouts around the country. None have gone viral like the 11 July 2021 protests [when thousands of people joined demonstrations across the island], but that protest started with a blackout,” he added. On Wednesday morning state-run bodegas and bakeries in the capital, Havana, were handing out rations of bread, rice and beans to the population. Hospitals were running on generators. Police stood in for traffic lights. But most retail and services were closed. Cuba has been recognized as “a model in hurricane risk management” by the United Nations. When a hurricane hits, Cubans are approximately 10 times less likely to die than somebody living in the US according to a comparison of official statistics from the two countries carried out by the Cuban Meteorological Institute. Before Ian, some 40,000 people were evacuated from Pinar del Río province: a confidence that the state prioritizes saving lives accounts for the perplexing nonchalance many Cubans display in the face of hurricanes. But as material living conditions have degraded on the island in recent years, people are worried about what happens after the storm, especially as power cuts persist. “Of course I’m scared – what am I going to give my child to eat?” said Alejandra Romero, 46, a housewife in Havana. “Things will go off in the fridge – chicken – that’s the only thing there is here,” she said with a grim chuckle. Ever since spring, daily power cuts were already a reality for millions of Cubans, especially those outside the capital. Breakdowns at power plants have this year become alarmingly frequent. A deadly blaze that melted half of Cuba’s main oil depot last month, further complicated matters. Most of Cuba’s electricity is oil-generated. US sanctions put in place by the Trump administration and left in place by Biden have knocked billions of dollars off annual state revenues, forcing the government to reduce capital imports in recent years. Analysts say a lack of spare parts could hamper efforts to get the grid back on line. “The hurricane offers Washington an opportunity … to offer disaster assistance,” said LeoGrande, the political scientist. “President Biden frequently says that he stands with the Cuban people. This is an opportunity to make that pledge a reality.” But given the parlous state of US-Cuban relations, material aid from the island’s northern neighbour is seen as unlikely. Cuba’s National Electricity Union said on Wednesday that it had re-established “micro-circuits” of power in the east of the island and in parts of the capital. Yet most of the country remained without electricity. No date was given for when power would be fully restored. In the Hotel Capri, one of the few places with a generator where the paying public can come to get a coffee in the capital, Lizbet Martí, 39, a hairdresser, was queueing to charge her phone. She had hardly slept – without a fan, the heat and humidity had kept her and her three-year-old daughter awake. “This hurricane has affected me more than most,” she said. “It will hit people’s pockets, our diet, and our kids are at home because schools are closed.” Asked when the power would return, she offered a grimace. “I don’t even know what to tell you. When something breaks here, it’s … complicated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/28/hurricane-ian-cuba-power-florida-electricity-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T09:39:04Z","webTitle":"Cuba left without power as Hurricane Ian heads to Florida | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/28/hurricane-ian-cuba-power-florida-electricity-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/28/hurricane-ian-cuba-power-florida-electricity-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Hurricane Ian has caused Cuba’s electricity grid to collapse, leaving the entire country without power, as residents in Florida braced for the arrival of an expected catastrophic category 4 storm. The west of Cuba was hit by violent winds and flooding on Tuesday that affected infrastructure, state-run media reported, while some of the country’s most important tobacco farms were devastated. Cuba’s National Electricity Union said power was being restored gradually overnight and this morning. Lázaro Guerra Hernández, from the Electric Union of Cuba, called it “an exceptional condition – a total of zero” electricity generation. “We are starting the process of restoring the system. It’s a process that takes time, it must be done with precision,” he said. Where is Hurricane Ian heading? The powerful storm is heading directly for Florida’s south-western coast, after striking Cuba with winds of 125mph (205km/h). The storm is expected to intensify in strength as it moves over the Gulf of Mexico and west of Florida’s southern tip on Tuesday night, before heading toward the Tampa Bay region. How is Florida getting ready? Officials put the region under a hurricane warning, alerting people of catastrophic storm surges, high winds and flooding. Businesses in Florida were shuttering and officials ordered 2.5 million people to evacuate before it crashes ashore today. McConnell endorses bipartisan bill to prevent efforts to overturn US elections The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said yesterday he would “proudly support” legislation to overhaul rules for certifying presidential elections, bolstering a bipartisan effort to revise a 19th-century law and avoid any repeat of the January 6 insurrection. The legislation would clarify and expand parts of the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which, along with the constitution, governs how states and Congress certify electors and declare presidential winners. The changes in the certification process are in response to unsuccessful efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to exploit loopholes in the law and overturn his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. McConnell made the remarks just before a committee vote on the legislation. He said he would back the bill as long as a bipartisan agreement on the language was not significantly changed. What did he say? “Congress’s process for counting the presidential electors’ votes was written 135 years ago,” McConnell said. “The chaos that came to a head on January 6 of last year certainly underscored the need for an update.” US to denounce ‘sham referendums’ at UN security council The US will introduce a resolution at the UN security council calling on member states not to recognise any change to Ukraine and obligating Russia to withdraw its troops, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said the “propaganda so-called ‘referendums’ in the temporarily occupied territories” are “yet another Russian crime” and that it considers them “null and worthless”. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has also spoken out about the referendums, saying he will introduce further sanctions against Russia in response to the “sham” referendums held in occupied Ukrainian regions. Trudeau said Canada was “actively engaging with our international partners and allies to ensure a united rejection” and that his government intended to “impose new sanctions on the persons and entities complicit in this latest attempt to undermine principles of state sovereignty”. What is happening with the Nord Stream pipelines leaks? Sabotage is the most likely cause of leaks in two Baltic Sea gas pipelines between Russia and Europe, European leaders have said, after seismologists reported explosions around the Nord Stream pipelines.

Mohammed bin Salman has been named prime minister of Saudi Arabia in a move that experts said would probably shield the crown prince from a potentially damaging lawsuit in the US in connection to his alleged role in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Stat of the day: Half of world’s bird species in decline as destruction of avian life intensifies Nearly half of the planet’s bird species are in decline, according to a definitive report that paints the grimmest picture yet of the destruction of avian life. The State of the World’s Birds report shows that the intensification of agriculture is putting pressure on 73% of species. Logging, invasive species, exploitation of natural resources and climate breakdown are the other main threats. Globally, 49% of bird species are declining, one in eight are threatened with extinction and at least 187 species are confirmed or suspected to have gone extinct since 1500. Don’t miss this: They tried to shut down Drag Story Hour. A Montana bookstore fought back On a Saturday in mid-July, retired police officer and army veteran Jim Thomas joined a vocal crowd outside a local LGBTQ-owned independent bookstore and began scanning his surroundings, writes Mara Silvers. Standing 6ft 4in and about 200lbs, with a camouflage baseball hat and scraggly eyebrows, Thomas arrived with a mission: make sure Drag Story Hour, the family-friendly reading event where sparkling drag performers read children’s books to kids and families, went off without a hitch. “I think it’s incumbent upon us to stand up and help where we can, if we can,” said Thomas. … Or this: The Guardian’s climate crisis reporting goes where others fear – or refuse – to tread With the exception of all-out nuclear war, the most important problems that confront us are environmental. None of our hopes, none of our dreams, none of our plans and expectations can survive the loss of a habitable planet. And there is scarcely an Earth system that is not now threatened with collapse. Yet you would scarcely know it. Most of the media, most of the time, either ignore our environmental crisis, downplay it or deny it. Our mission is to put the environment front and centre, writes George Monbiot. Climate check: Huge expansion of oil pipelines endangering climate, says report More than 24,000km of new oil pipelines are under development around the world, a distance equivalent to almost twice the Earth’s diameter, a report has revealed. The projects, led by the US, Russia, China and India, are “dramatically at odds with plans to limit global warming to 1.5C or 2C”, the researchers said. The oil pumped through the pipelines would produce at least 5bn tonnes of CO2 a year if completed, equivalent to the emissions of the US, the world’s second largest polluter. About 40% of the pipelines are already under construction, with the rest in planning.

And since I was the eldest sibling, I was her movie date. She loved James Bond and took me to see Goldfinger. The theatre was packed. Those Bond films have explosions and shootings, but there was a lull in the action and everything was quiet. I said: ‘Mommy, why is that lady named Pussy Galore?’ And the whole audience heard me. My mother grabbed me by the neck and said: ‘Don’t say another word!’” Lee cackles, clearly tickled. “She was so embarrassed.” He pauses. “Pussy Galore,” he repeats, laughing. Although the film-maker’s grasp of cinema has come a long way since then, there is still something in him reminiscent of that six-year-old boy: curious, unafraid to speak his mind, keen to ask awkward questions. After a career spanning more than 30 years, the 65-year-old has developed a reputation as Hollywood’s conscience. His films have chronicled black lives and challenged assumptions about race, class and gender; in interviews and speeches, he has thundered against social injustice, police brutality and the entertainment industry’s problems with representation. For all of this and more, Lee was this week awarded the BFI Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Film Institute to individuals for their “outstanding contribution to film or television culture”. Previous recipients have included Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Elizabeth Taylor and Steve McQueen. “One person might accept an award,” says Lee, speaking from Los Angeles, “but a lot of people were responsible that you don’t see. This fellowship is for all the people that have helped me. Not just people in the industry, but my parents, siblings, teachers, not to forget my beautiful wife Tonya.” There isn’t room to list all of Lee’s work. Since the 1986 Cannes premiere of She’s Gotta Have It, a radical sex comedy about an African American woman and her three male suitors, shot in two weeks for $175,000, he has made dozens of films. Highlights include 1989’s Do the Right Thing, which explored racial tensions in Brooklyn, and 2018’s BlacKkKlansman, the true story of a black detective who went undercover with the Ku Klux Klan. In between came Inside Man, a thriller about a Wall Street heist, and 4 Little Girls, a documentary about the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. But perhaps his most renowned work is Malcolm X, his 1992 biopic of the African American activist, starring Denzel Washington and Angela Bassett. The film, which is being reissued on a new 35mm print in liaison with the BFI National Archive this summer, opens with grainy footage of Rodney King being beaten by Los Angeles police in 1991, set against Washington delivering the Malcolm X speech I Charge the White Man. How relevant does Lee think it is today? “Very relevant. Did you see what happened in Memphis recently?” says Lee, referring to the killing of Tyre Nichols, a shocking reminder that history has a habit of repeating itself. “Malcolm X will stand the test of time. And that performance by Denzel still amazes me. It’s one of the greatest I’ve ever seen.” As for the fight against racism, he adds: “It’s always two steps forward, one step back. But I’ll never say there’s been no progress. The struggle continues.” Malcolm X was once again being hotly debated only last week after Daniel Scheinert, one of the directors of Everything Everywhere All at Once, called it his favourite “crime movie”. Lee seems nonplussed, even amused. “I’d never heard that description before,” he laughs. “But look, I’m not going to kill the guy. I’ve misspoken many times in my life, too. So I’m calling on Black Twitter to give the guy a break – because when Black Twitter gets on your ass, they get on your ass.” It’s a surprisingly magnanimous stance from an auteur who’s never pulled his punches, having previously entangled with the likes of Donald Trump (who complained about Lee’s “racist hit on your president” 2019 Oscars speech), Quentin Tarantino (for the excessive use of the N-word in his films), Clint Eastwood (for the absence of African American soldiers in Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima), and black director Tyler Perry (for the “buffoonery” of his Madea franchise). This is the kind of toughness his late mother perceived in him when she nicknamed him Spike. Lee was born Shelton Jackson Lee in Atlanta, Georgia, but raised in what he calls “the Republic of Brooklyn”. His mother was a teacher of arts and black literature, while his father is a jazz musician. He went to Morehouse, a historically black college in Atlanta that counts Martin Luther King Jr and Samuel L Jackson among its alumni, and later New York University (NYU) graduate film school. Within his first few weeks at NYU, Lee became a voice of dissent, taking issue with his class being shown The Birth of a Nation, DW Griffith’s 1915 epic, notorious for glorifying the Ku Klux Klan. They were taught about the film’s technical innovations, with no mention of it being a recruiting tool for the Klan. In response, he made a student film called The Answer, in which a young black director is hired by a Hollywood studio to remake The Birth of a Nation. When his vision is compromised by the studio, the director pulls out and is attacked by Klan members who place a burning cross in front of his house. Some NYU faculty members found the film so offensive that they recommended (unsuccessfully) that Lee not be invited back for his final two years. The incident foreshadowed the complicated, and at times fraught, relationship between Lee and the film industry. Lee has received numerous accolades including an Oscar, two Emmys and a Bafta – as well as plenty of castigation. “People forget that when Do the Right Thing came out, critics with loud voices said: ‘This film will incite African Americans to riot all across the country.’ It sounds crazy now, but that was written by prominent film critics, that my film would cause black folks to run amok. They’ve still never said they fucked up. It was a very racist take on a film that dealt with the legacy of racism in the US.” Then there’s been the constant battle with the Academy Awards. In 1990, the feelgood race-relations film Driving Miss Daisy won best picture over Do the Right Thing while Do The Right Thing wasn’t even nominated in the category, causing much controversy. (It was nominated in two other categories.) Three decades later, in 2019, BlacKkKlansman was beaten to best picture by Green Book, which reportedly led to Lee waving his arms in disgust and appearing to storm out. (BlacKkKlansman did win an Oscar, though, for best adapted screenplay.) A few months after Lee was awarded an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar, the director became one of the leading figures of the #OscarsSoWhite campaign and the 2016 boycott of the Academy Awards, after the second consecutive year in which no people of colour were nominated in any acting category. While there have been advances, criticism resurfaced this year when no black women were nominated for best actress. Although strongly tipped, both Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) were overlooked, while Britain’s Andrea Riseborough was included for her performance in low-budget drama To Leslie after a last-minute campaign from celebrities. The Academy reviewed and later upheld Riseborough’s nomination after a backlash. “You know, I’ve really got nothing to say about it,” Lee replies when asked about the nominations. “I’m happy Angela Bassett got nominated. I’m happy Ruth Carter – who for a long time was my costume designer – got nominated.” But beyond that, he remains tight-lipped. “It gets tricky when you get these award things. And the Academy has a history with …” He hesitates. “The Academy has a history, let’s leave it at that. But the whole #OscarsSoWhite hashtag definitely made an impact. The Academy, to their credit, made changes to bring diversity to the voting body.” He’s more forthcoming about the recent Grammy awards – in particular Beyoncé losing out in the best album category. “I’m not the male president of the Bey Hive [Beyoncé’s fanbase], but I love and support Beyoncé. Her album is amazing. I know she’s won multiple Grammys, but four times nominated for album of the year and she’s lost every time? No disrespect to those artists like Adele or Harry Styles who won. It’s not their fault, but that’s some straight-up bullshit. “There’s a history of great black artists who come up for these awards and don’t win. We all know their work is great, because art speaks for itself. But then it always comes down to this tricky territory of validation. Do black artists say: ‘Fuck it’ – or seek white validation and chase awards? I just want to give a shoutout to my sister Beyoncé. We know what the deal is. It’s straight-up shenanigans, skulduggery, subterfuge. Or as the British say: it’s some poppycock!” How difficult is it for artists to speak out? “It depends who you’re talking about,” he says. “I’ve learned that you have to speak truth to power. When I take my last breath, which won’t be soon by the way, it’ll be written that I was on the right side of history. But it’s an individual choice. There’s certain times when you know there’ll be repercussions and you’ve got to make a choice to speak out or clam up.” But speaking truth to power, he adds, has never felt like a burden. “Because I’ve never tried to position myself as speaking for 45 million African Americans. I always say, ‘This is my opinion’. Fairly early on, my late mother said: ‘Spike, we as black people are not one monolithic group. We don’t look alike, talk alike, think alike. We’re very diverse, from many different backgrounds.’ And I took that to heart.” Nevertheless, Lee has become a leading cultural figure in his own right. Four of his films are preserved in the US National Film Registry for being culturally and historically significant. He’s made music videos for the likes of Public Enemy, Stevie Wonder and Prince, and adverts with Michael Jordan for Nike. Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date was to see Do the Right Thing. He even managed to get the then newly released Nelson Mandela to make a cameo in Malcolm X. Lee, who is also a tenured professor at NYU, recently entered into a partnership with Netflix that will see him directing and producing narrative features. As part of his visit to the BFI – a trip he has scheduled around Arsenal’s home game against Manchester City – he will be teaching students a masterclass. When I ask him what his one tip for young film-makers is, the answer is fairly simple: “Bust your ass.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/08/the-week-boris-johnson-lost-his-grip-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-08T16:40:56Z","webTitle":"The week Boris Johnson lost his grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/08/the-week-boris-johnson-lost-his-grip-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/08/the-week-boris-johnson-lost-his-grip-on-power","fields":{"bodyText":"On Thursday last week Boris Johnson headed home from the Nato summit in Madrid having spent several days in the company of world leaders. At the preceding G7 in Bavaria, speaking loudly enough for the camera to pick up, he had joked: “Can we take our clothes off?” in a supposed riposte to an old shot of Vladimir Putin topless. At Nato he had at least tried to think long-term, making a public promise to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030. Yet his premiership ended one week later – by which time the only military comment he would make was to privately compare himself to a Japanese soldier who had refused to surrender for 29 years after the second world war. The joke was remarkably apt. The remarkable disintegration of his premiership began the moment he left the Nato photocalls behind. Chris Pincher resigned as a deputy chief whip the evening Johnson returned, after allegations that Pincher had groped two men at the Carlton Club in Westminster. The story was bad enough, but what followed was a disastrous series of evasions, half-truths – and even the sense that Johnson thought it all a joke. On Friday last week, Downing Street said firstly that the prime minister had not been aware of any allegations against Pincher when he promoted him in February, and then hours later that he had not been aware of any “specific” allegations. Yet even that turned out not to be accurate as more complaints about Pincher emerged. Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings, long waiting for the opportunity to land the final blow, suggested Johnson had known all along and had referred to his colleague as “Pincher by name, pincher by nature”. More damning evidence was to follow. On Tuesday morning a former senior Foreign Office civil servant, Simon McDonald, said there had been a similar previous incident involving Pincher when he as a junior Foreign Office minister in 2019, and that Johnson had been “briefed in person about the initiation and outcome of the investigation”. Jason Groves, the political editor of the pro-Tory Daily Mail, began that day’s briefing for lobby journalists by asking the prime minister’s spokesperson: “Will you be telling the truth?” – prompting a somewhat embarrassed civil servant to reply that they provided “the information available to me at the time of each meeting”. Johnson toured the tea rooms to try to salvage the situation. But as the Conservative MP Gary Sambrook revealed on Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, Johnson sought to blame everybody bar the perpetrator. According to Sambrook, Johnson said: “There were seven MPs in the Carlton Club last week, and one of them should have tried to intervene to stop Chris drinking so much.” Sambrook was applauded as he called on him to resign, but by then it was already clear Johnson’s premiership was in the end game – even if Johnson was the last to see it. The night before, Sajid Javid and then Rishi Sunak had resigned, releasing similar statements nine minutes apart that focused squarely on the issue of Johnson’s character. “The British people rightly expect integrity from their government,” Javid wrote in a statement published at 6.02pm. Sunak wrote: “The public expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously.” The statements looked coordinated even if both camps denied it. Resignations of mostly junior ministers carried on at an extraordinary rate on Wednesday, the first coming while the new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, was doing a broadcast media round in the morning, and continuing through to the Welsh secretary Simon Hart at 10.33pm. By midnight the final departure count was more than 40. It had been an easy day for Keir Starmer. At prime minister’s questions the Labour leader read out an account from a victim of Pincher – “he slowly moved his hand down in front of my groin” – in the deliberate style of a prosecutor. Then he pressed Johnson on why the former whip had been promoted in the first place. From teatime ministers began converging on Downing Street, mostly to demand Johnson’s head, and a handful to encourage him to stay. The prime minister saw them individually. Even Priti Patel, the normally loyal home secretary, said she thought he could not carry on. It was expected that Johnson, having taken the temperature of his most senior colleagues, would conclude the game was up, as had Margaret Thatcher a generation before. There was even a scheduled early evening phone call with the Queen. But, remarkably, Johnson concluded for a moment that he could fight on. In a final show of frustration and flexing of his waning power, he sacked Michael Gove from the cabinet while Gove’s children and ex-wife Sarah Vine were watching Love Island. According to Vine, a columnist for the Daily Mail, Gove told her: “The prime minister rang me a few minutes ago and told me it was time for me to step back. I said respectfully: ‘Prime minister, if it anyone should be stepping back it is you.’” Downing Street said Gove had had to go because “you can’t have a snake who is not with you on any of the big arguments”. That night the Sun was told that Tory rebels would have to “dip their hands in blood” if they were going to force out a prime minister who had won an election in December 2019. A night’s sleep and the fightback was over, although some could not wait. Michelle Donelan resigned as education secretary shortly before 9am on Thursday, after about 36 hours in post. She told Johnson it was the only way to “force your hand”. Had she waited the length of a maths lesson, she might have changed her mind. With more and more resignation letters landing on the doormat on Downing Street, officials stopped taking calls from journalists on Thursday morning, prompting the immediate suspicion that it was finally all over. Johnson apparently got up at 6am to write a resignation speech, in which he would blame the “herd instinct” for his departure rather than any particular misjudgment – over Pincher or parties or propriety. It fell to the BBC’s new political editor, Chris Mason, to tell the nation, taking a phone call from Downing Street while live on Radio 4 shortly after 9am. On his return to the microphone, with a guest gently moved aside, a cool Mason said simply: “The prime minister has agreed to stand down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/05/prince-harry-royal-fist-fight-power-monarchy-heir","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T15:42:58Z","webTitle":"Harry's allegations are not just about a royal fistfight – but the very real dangers of hereditary power | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/prince-harry-royal-fist-fight-power-monarchy-heir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/prince-harry-royal-fist-fight-power-monarchy-heir","fields":{"bodyText":"When my younger sister was very small, I once pushed her down the stairs. Fortunately, she was still small enough to bounce. But it was the beginning, not the end, of the fighting. We pinched and slapped in the back of the car on long interminable journeys, over a fraction of an inch invasion into each other’s elbow space. We scrapped over toys and games and who got the biggest share of pudding; then over clothes and boys and who was most popular at school (all right, it was her). We fought like all siblings fight and I can’t even remember now what most of it was about, but deep down it was probably the thing most sibling fights are really about, namely who is the most loved. Luckily in our family it was never obvious who was the favourite, which may help explain why these days we love each other to death; why the older we get, the closer we have become, through the years of bringing up our own children and now into the years of looking after our parents. But as I said, we were lucky. Prince William and Prince Harry have been less so, which may explain why – according to the latter’s new book, Spare, a grimly revealing title if ever there was one – three years ago the brothers came to blows even as full-grown men. The fight was ostensibly about Harry’s wife, Meghan, and he writes angrily about his older brother calling her “difficult”, “rude” and “abrasive”, echoing the whispers beginning to circulate about her in parts of the press. But it seemingly escalated violently after Harry accused William of acting like an heir: the chosen one, around whom everything else seemingly revolves. There isn’t a sibling alive who won’t, on some level, recognise that feeling. But the twist in this case is that resentment is inexorably baked into a hereditary monarchy from birth. Its strength but also its weakness is that it exercises power through a family, with all the primordial and potentially destructive emotions that entails. Like them, loathe them, or merely long to hear no more about them ever again, in recent weeks the Sussexes have raised questions of genuine and awkward public interest. They held up an important mirror to the country by exploring the reaction, public and private, to a mixed-race royal marriage. They have served up some uncomfortable truths too about the long and sometimes grubby relationship between royals and the media, where some intrusion is grudgingly permitted in return for the nation keeping the family in the gilded style to which they have become accustomed. But this book takes the prince into a queasier realm, where the washing of dirty linen in public is no longer obviously linked to effecting change and the political gives way to the intensely personal. The details of the brothers’ alleged punch-up in a palace cottage are at once almost ridiculously trivial (he pushed me into a dog bowl!) and heartbreakingly sad. They were so young when they lost their mother, but at least they still had each other, and now it seems they don’t even have that. Harry clearly aches still to be reconciled – in trailers for yet more promotional interviews to be screened this weekend, he talks of wanting both his father and brother back – but every revelation surely makes that less likely. The younger prince’s tragedy is that the harder he fights for what he seems to want, which is to matter as much to his family as his older brother does, the further that slips out of reach. For William doesn’t come out of all this looking good, and since childhood Harry’s function in brutal dynastic terms has been to absorb criticism that might otherwise fall on his older brother. The goal of monarchy is its own survival, which means its instinct is generally to protect the heir at all costs, while the spare – the younger brother – inevitably becomes more disposable. Harry was born the understudy, the plan B, and even then only until his brother had children. Unlike in centuries past, pushing back against this quasi-feudal order of things isn’t going to get him locked up in the Tower, but this is nonetheless a sibling relationship forged with the confines of a family that still considers it reasonable to curtsey to each other. If there’s a lesson to be drawn from all this misery, beyond the bleeding obvious one that there’s something deeply unhealthy about hereditary power, it’s arguably one for parents. For sadly, it’s not only children born into immense privilege who can be left feeling like spares. The perennially wise psychologist Dorothy Rowe once wrote that sibling relationships were ultimately all about “being validated or invalidated as a person”, since they are where we learn our first indelible lessons about rivalry and resentment, victory and shame, love and hate. They’re intense enough when all you’re fighting over is who stole whose tights, never mind the vast reserves of power embodied in a crown. What siblings crave above all else is fairness – or perhaps more accurately, the sense that the other one isn’t too far ahead in the eternal and terrifying war for their parents’ attention. It is a catastrophic thing, for a child to feel the lesser loved, and the scars run deep. For the sake of spares everywhere, I hope Harry finds the peace he so clearly seeks.

It is now 14 years on from the train “hijack” and government officials are considering their own raid on the North Yorkshire power station – this time on the company’s finances. The power giant, Britain’s single-biggest source of carbon emissions – thanks to the biomass and coal it burns – has benefited handsomely from the link between electricity prices and soaring gas prices, along with a group of nuclear plants and older solar and windfarm projects. This windfall – evident in a quadrupling of profits – has thrust Drax and its fellow generators, which are propped up by historic subsidies, into the eye of a gathering storm. With households and small businesses crushed by soaring bills, the government is considering options to break the link between gas and electricity prices as well as a windfall tax on electricity generators. The plan could be one of Kwasi Kwarteng’s first acts as chancellor if, as expected, he is promoted from business secretary by the UK’s new prime minister, Liz Truss. Germany’s decision to impose a windfall tax on electricity generators may embolden ministers to follow suit. Earlier this year, as the government imposed the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on North Sea oil and gas operators, a similar measure was mooted for electricity generators – but was dismissed as too complex. A further leaked Treasury analysis claimed gas producers and electricity generators could make £170bn in excess profits over two years. For most companies, precise figures on windfall profits are hard to come by. But for Drax it is clear that the good times roll. In July, the company said profit before tax had risen to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, bolstered by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, while landing a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. The group’s chief executive, Will Gardiner, saw his total pay package swell more than 30% to £2.7m. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 56% to 660p, valuing the company at £2.65bn, after peaking at 831p in April. But the threat of a windfall tax has twice punctured the share rally and it may now face pressure to rip up the contracts for its units which burn wood pellets. Thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, Drax will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies. The shape of any potential raid on electricity generators’ profits could prove crucial for Drax and its peers. A simple extension to corporation tax – as applied to the oil giants – could prove most damaging to profits and, critics argue, investor sentiment in green energy. Instead, the business department is reportedly scrutinising a plan which would see older Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) voluntarily ripped up in favour of Contracts for Difference (CFDs). ROCs are an anachronism from the early days of green power generation. They were first introduced in 2002, paying renewable energy producers the wholesale market rate plus a subsidy. The scheme was closed to new entrants in 2017 and replaced with less generous CfDs, which offer electricity plants a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity. If the market price is higher than the strike price, a government entity called the Low Carbon Contracts Company ensures these savings are passed on to consumers. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. LCCC data shows that with UK power prices more than tripling in the past year, windfarms have paid back more than £360m. Under the proposals, those with ROCs would be encouraged to switch to CfDs. The benefit to consumers could be lower bills, and for the company a guaranteed long-term income which could reassure investors. However, the voluntary scheme could be undermined if companies decide instead to take their chances that gas prices will remain high for years. For those on ROCs with only a few years remaining, it could prove attractive, less so for those with a decade to go. Denmark’s Ørsted held the most ROCs in 2020/21, ahead of Drax, SSE and Germany’s RWE. Although the energy market as a whole is dominated by a clutch of large players, nearly 60% of the UK onshore wind ROCs market consists of smaller developers, Bernstein analysts estimate. The ROCs register is public: it shows everything from the Achanalt power station, a small 20 megawatt hydroelectric site in the Scottish Highlands owned by SSE, to the Four Burrows windfarm, owned by renewable specialist RES, near Truro, Cornwall. However, the nature of each site’s contracts remain undisclosed. Many will be tied into long-term electricity supply deals typically agreed between power producers and electricity traders or suppliers. ROCs are also tradable. For larger companies, their power is predominately hedged ahead in the futures markets (sold in advance) – meaning some are yet to see the full benefit from this year’s surge in gas prices. RBC analyst John Musk said: “We previously saw a lot of rhetoric around extending the windfall tax to generators when the energy profits levy was originally announced. It was seen as too difficult then – and I do not see how that changes.” However, industry watchers are confident that nuclear power stations have recorded hefty gains. British Gas owner Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet, which is operated by EDF. Centrica reported operating profits of £1.3bn, and noted an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated, in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 per megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/mwh. Centrica had flirted with selling off its nuclear stake, but that plan was ditched last year. EDF is also likely to have seen a fillip, however the gains may be overshadowed by the debt-laden company’s woes in France where it is being nationalised. UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) estimates that if 100% of eligible UK wind and solar power projects were to participate in the contracts’ revamp the saving would be £12.8bn and £180 off bills. UKERC estimates that if its proposals were extended to units 2 and 3 of Drax, which burn biomass and receive RO payments, the collective savings would be £14.8bn a year. If all of Britain’s nuclear power stations participated, overall savings would reach £22.4bn. Dan Monzani, managing director for the UK and Ireland at consultancy Aurora, said UKERC’s proposal could lower the price over the next two to three winters in exchange for a fixed price extending for the remainder of the stations’ technical life. “This would spread the impact of the war on Ukraine over more years,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/16/emmanuel-macron-uses-special-powers-to-force-pension-reform-france","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T18:38:06Z","webTitle":"Macron uses special powers to force through plan to raise pension age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/emmanuel-macron-uses-special-powers-to-force-pension-reform-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/16/emmanuel-macron-uses-special-powers-to-force-pension-reform-france","fields":{"bodyText":"The French government has used controversial special constitutional powers to force through a rise in the pension age amid chaotic scenes in parliament in which radical left MPs sang La Marseillaise at the top of their voices to stop the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, from speaking. The president, Emmanuel Macron, took a last-minute decision to avoid a parliamentary vote and instead push through his unpopular plan to raise the pension age from 62 to 64. Minutes before MPs in the lower house were to vote, Macron was still holding a series of frantic meetings with senior political figures, and suddenly chose to use special powers instead of risking a vote, which he appeared poised to lose. He opted to invoke article 49.3 of the constitution, which gives the government power to bypass parliament. MPs on the left shouted “Resign! Resign!” at Borne, and members of the radical left party France Unbowed sang the national anthem so loudly that Borne could at first not speak and the session had to be suspended before she tried again to be heard. Borne told parliament the bill would be pushed through because the government could not “gamble the future of our pensions”. Macron had told cabinet ministers that “the financial risks were too great” if the law had been rejected by MPs, according to reports from inside talks at the Élysée. Shortly afterwards, thousands of people gathered in a spontaneous protest at Place de la Concorde in the centre of the city, as trade unions promised to intensify the strikes and street demonstrations that have taken place since January. The head of the hardline CGT union, Philippe Martinez, said forcing through the law “shows contempt towards the people”. Police fired teargas and water cannon and charged in an effort to disperse the crowd on Thursday night, as some protesters threw cobblestones. In several other French cities including Marseille there were also spontaneous protests against the reform. Police have arrested 120 people in Paris, according to Le Figaro. A police officer was reportedly injured in one standoff with protestors and rioters. After the rally was dispersed, some protesters created fires and caused damage to shop fronts in side streets, Agence France-Presse reporters said. Several stores were looted during protests in Marseille, in the country’s south, while clashes between protesters and security forces also erupted in the western cities of Nantes and Rennes as well as Lyon in the south-east, they said. French unions called for another day of strikes and action against the reform on Thursday 23 March. Politicians on the left called the government’s move a major defeat and a sign of weakness. The government was accused of being brutal and undemocratic. Borne had seemed aware in recent weeks of the uproar and protests that could be prompted by the use of “49.3” special powers, and had appeared reluctant to use them. Opposition politicians will call for a vote of no confidence in the government in the next 24 hours. Whether this can pass will depend on whether polarised opposition parties would group together. Any no-confidence vote would need the support of the right’s Les Républicains to pass, but the party’s leader, Éric Ciotti, said it would not support such a vote. Macron made no public comment on Thursday but Agence France-Presse said he told a closed-door cabinet meeting: “You cannot play with the future of the country.” The political crisis over pensions changes highlights how Macron’s position has been severely undermined in the national assembly after his centrist grouping failed to win an absolute majority in parliamentary elections last June. Without one, it had relied on winning over MPs from the Les Républicains party to support the pensions project, but then decided the numbers were not enough. The Communist MP Fabien Roussel called on street protesters and trade unionists to keep mobilising. Under Macron’s pension changes, the minimum general retirement age will increase from 62 to 64, some public sector workers will lose privileges and there will be an accelerated increase in the number of years of work required to qualify for a full pension. Some politicians from the centrist Modem party, which is allied with Macron’s Renaissance group in parliament, said forcing the bill through was a mistake. Erwan Balanant, a Brittany MoDem MP, said he had left the parliament chamber “in a state of shock”. Other centrist MPs said it was a waste and showed weakness. “It’s a total failure for the government,” the far-right leader Marine Le Pen told reporters afterwards, adding that Borne should resign. Polls show that two-thirds of French people oppose the pension changes. Transport workers, energy workers, dockers, teachers and public sector workers, including museum staff, have held strikes in recent weeks. A continuing rubbish-collection strike and has led to more than 7,000 tonnes of waste building up across half of Paris. Trade unions say the reform will penalise low-income people in manual jobs who tend to start their careers early, forcing them to work longer than graduates, who are less affected by the changes. The government has argued that raising the retirement age, scrapping privileges for some public sector workers and toughening criteria for a full pension are needed to prevent big deficits building up. The change would bring France into line with its European neighbours, most of which have raised the retirement age to 65 or older."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/08/power-and-politics-why-the-alleged-of-brittany-higgins-has-sparked-a-wider-conversation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T19:00:09Z","webTitle":"Power and politics: how the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins sparked a reckoning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/08/power-and-politics-why-the-alleged-of-brittany-higgins-has-sparked-a-wider-conversation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/08/power-and-politics-why-the-alleged-of-brittany-higgins-has-sparked-a-wider-conversation","fields":{"bodyText":"At a crowded bar on Canberra’s Kingston Foreshore on a Friday night in March 2019, a group of young political staffers, public servants and defence contractors met for after-work drinks. For most of the people at the Dock Bar that evening, it was the kind of night that blurs quickly into many others like it; they drank beer, ate pizza, looked at their phones during lulls in the conversation. Others danced with the ease of people confident CCTV footage of that night wouldn’t later be played to a packed Canberra courtroom in the trial of Bruce Lehrmann, the man accused of raping Brittany Higgins inside Parliament House in the early hours of the next morning. This week, after a series of delays caused in part by the wave of media attention the trial has garnered, it began. On Tuesday, wearing a navy suit, tan boots and a gold-faced watch, Lehrmann pleaded not guilty. Since Higgins went public with her allegations last year, she – and her story – have become central to a much wider conversation about the nature of power in politics and the culture inside federal parliament. In her instructions to the jury, the chief justice, Lucy McCallum, acknowledged as much, saying the case had become a “cause célèbre” with a “momentum of its own”. The jury, she said, must put those considerations aside to focus on whether the case against Lehrmann had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. On a drunken night out, did a Coalition staff member rape his colleague on a lounge inside parliament house, or – as Lerhmann’s defence barrister, Steven Whybrow, put it his week – have the Australian public been “sold a pup”? The night The two were colleagues inside the office of then defence industries minister Linda Reynolds and were among the crowd at the Dock on that Friday night. Later, they went to another bar in Canberra with two other Liberal party staffers. In this witness stand this week, Higgins initially remained composed as she watched footage of the night, occasionally answering questions about how much she drank: 10 or 11 drinks at the Dock, shots at another bar later, “as drunk as I’ve ever been in my life” she later told police. Higgins painted a grim picture of the evening; with the 2019 election looming, Liberal party staffers were “lamenting” about what they believed would be a loss. They were “all about to be unemployed in six weeks”, she said, so were “pretty sad”. She didn’t know the people in the group well, and, being new in Reynolds’ office, had invited Lehrmann, who she had an “adversarial” relationship with, to show she could “value-add”. She also brought along a date who, she said, was “bullied mercilessly” for wearing a suit. “I think because everyone in that group had this weirdly high opinion of themselves on the basis they worked in parliament or defence in some sort of position they perceived to be important,” she said. “So he left.” At about 1.30am, Higgins and Lehrmann shared a cab. She recalls him telling her that he needed to go via Parliament House to pick up some documents. Despite neither of them having their security passes, they found their way through security and into the office. Get our free news app, morning email briefing or daily news podcast Higgins broke down as she watched herself going through security, struggling to put her shoes on, while Lehrmann waited. She says she remembers sitting on a ledge in Reynolds’ suite, before making her way to a lounge directly opposite the minister’s desk. It’s there, she alleges, that she woke to Lehrmann raping her. In interviews with police played in court this week, she described waking because of a pain in her thigh from Lehrmann’s knee digging into her, of him “grunting” above her, and of repeatedly telling him to stop. “I told him no. I told him to stop,” she said in the interview. “It felt like I was on repeat [but] at that point, I don’t know why, but it felt like it was going on for a while [and] it was an afterthought. I was suddenly there and it didn’t matter.” She felt “trapped”, she said, and “not human”. Lehrmann denies her account. Despite the ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold SC, accusing him of having “lied” in accounts of why he went to parliament that morning, his barrister, Steven Whybrow, says that Lehrmann had collected some documents and called an Uber before leaving without Higgins. They did not have sex, he said. A witness had seen Lehrmann and Higgins kissing at the second bar they attended that night, 88mph, something she says she does not remember. A security guard who saw Higgins passed out on the lounge at about 4am had described her as being naked, while she remembered her dress being “scrunched up”. It was a key difference, Whybrow contended; “different inferences flow from whether she had perhaps taken the dress off before passing out waiting for Mr Lehrmann”, he told the jury. The fallout The first person that Higgins told about the alleged rape was her chief of staff, Fiona Brown, about four days later, during a private meeting, according to Higgins. Her presence with Lehrmann inside parliament in the early hours of that Saturday morning had been a breach of security, and she at first feared she would lose her job. “The moment I vocalised and said it to Fiona that’s when it fully hit me and identified it as rape … I knew what had happened, I knew it was wrong,” she said in an interview with police played to the court. While she described Brown as being sympathetic, it was also, she said, “when the gears shifted and it became less about me and more political”. On 1 April she had a meeting with both Brown and Reynolds inside the same office where she alleges the rape occurred. “That was quite a distracting element. I was quite panicked just on the basis that I was in the room with the couch, so the words were a little bit lost,” she told the court. While there was “a general level of empathy”, the topic soon turned to the looming 2019 election. They were “trying to feel out”, she said, whether Higgins planned to go to the police. “My interpretation of that was that if I raised it with police, there were going to be problems and they wanted to be involved or informed, but just by having the meeting in the room, it all seemed really off,” she said. “And my interpretation of that was a bit of a scare tactic or an intimidation tactic, whether it was intentional or not, that’s not a fair assumption.” A recurring theme in Higgins’ evidence was her fear of coming forward. After initially filing a report with police about the alleged assault, on 15 April 2019 – five days after the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, called the 2019 election – she wrote to officers to tell them she would not proceed with the complaint. “It’s just not the right decision for me personally, especially in light of my current workplace demands,” she wrote. She described, through both evidence to police and during her witness testimony in court, a fear that her “dream” career as a political staffer would be over if she reported the alleged rape to police. Higgins says she did things like deleting messages off of her phone, or paying for a doctor’s appointment without using a medicare card, out of her fear of the “party implications”, and, she said on Friday, concern about the flow of information to the then home affairs minister Peter Dutton. “I was so scared of coming forward,” she said in a police interview recorded in May of 2021. “I was really cognisant of all the party implications all the way through. Because of the pressure I was feeling I made it hard for myself … it was so stupid.” The media During his opening address to the jury and in his cross-examination, the barrister for Lehrmann, Steven Whybrow, repeatedly raised the fact Higgins spoke to the media – in interviews with the journalists Samantha Maiden and Lisa Wilkinson – before seeking to reinstate her complaint with police. She had “erased” key details from the night, including the fact a witness says they saw her and Lehrmann kissing, and said the Australian public had been “sold a pup” over the allegations. Calling it “a story whose time had come”, Whybrow said Higgins’ partner, David Sharaz, and Wilkinson “were not going to let the facts get in the way of a good story.” But Higgins described it differently, saying that at times she felt that her alleged rape became “not about me or my story”. She was not trying to damage the Liberal party by coming forward, she said, but to change it. “I loved my party, I loved the Liberal party,” she said. “It sounds absurd. I didn’t necessarily want to hurt them. I wanted to reform this issue.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T17:47:27Z","webTitle":"US and UK tell Russia to stop using hunger as leverage in Ukraine conflict – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-15-missiles-shot-down-over-kyiv-as-victory-day-begins-in-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The time is approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news. Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. He accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force, which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war, as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue. Blinken said: “In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food.The world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Popko said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack, which was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Cleverly warned that people should not get too carried away with their hopes for Ukraine’s counter offensive. “We have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. That’s all for today. Thank you for following along. The situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, is deteriorating, Funke Media Group has reported. According to Ukraine’s state-owned operating company Energoatom, Russia is bringing more troops and military vehicles to the site of the nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. “The situation of equipment and personnel is deteriorating,” the Energoatom president, Petro Kotin, told Funke. The UK foreign secretary and US secretary of state have urged Russia not to use global hunger as a tool of war in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as discussions continue about the resumption of the Black Sea grain deal. Speaking at a joint press conference in Washington, James Cleverly and Antony Blinken spoke about the war, as well as relations with China and the recent evacuation of nationals in Sudan amid the country falling into civil war. Speaking first, Blinken said: “We are urging Russia to extend and expand the Black Sea grain initiative. In recent days, Russia has once again returned to blocking ships from sailing to Ukrainian ports to pick up grain. A cynical action, that directly results in less food getting to global food markets and to human beings in Africa, in the Middle East and around the world who need that food. “While we are grateful for the tireless efforts of [UN] general secretary Guterres, our colleagues in Turkey, working to break this impasse, the world shouldn’t need to remind Moscow every few weeks to stop using people’s hunger as a weapon in their war against Ukraine.” The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the US in June, where he will meet Joe Biden in Washington. London will host the Ukraine rebuilding conference in the same month, in an attempt to examine how cities, towns and infrastructure will recover post-conflict. Cleverly struck the same tone. After thanking Blinken for his remarks, including congratulations sent to King Charles III on his coronation, the foreign secretary said: “Just as we did with Sudan, we remain focused on the needs of some of the poorest people in the world. I echo your comments on the Black Sea grain initiative. “It is completely wrong that Russia uses the hunger of some of the poorest people in the world to pursue leverage in this conflict. They should resign the Black Sea grain initiative and do so immediately, they should unlock the supply of food to go to those people around the world who need it most and it is perverse that they are using hunger in the developing world as leverage in their conflict in Ukraine.” Some more on the comments by James Cleverly in the US. The UK foreign secretary said that Ukraine’s offensive may not be “decisive” in an attempt to play down expectations of a “Hollywood” style sweep to retake occupied areas of the country. On a visit to Washington he said that more aid must be delivered, but added: “They have demonstrated themselves to be very, very effective defenders of their country, but we need to recognise that there might not be a simple, quick, decisive breakthrough,” Cleverly said at the Atlantic Council, Agence France-Presse reports. “I hope and expect they will do very, very well, because whenever I’ve seen the Ukrainians they have outperformed expectations. “But we have to be realistic. This is the real world; this is not a Hollywood movie,” he said. Cleverly called for western powers “to have the resolve to continue to do the right thing” no matter how the offensive progresses, including the prospect of “escalatory words” from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we don’t, what’s at stake is of immeasurable importance,” he said. UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has told a US audience at the Atlantic Council that he would welcome China’s involvement in helping bring the war in Ukraine to an end. He said: “I don’t think we should be ‘dog in the manger’ about this. We know that Xi enjoys a significant degree of influence with Vladimir Putin. If he can use that influence to deliver on what he has publicly stated he feels strongly about, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the non-use of nuclear weapons, the non-threat of nuclear weapons, then why would we be critical of that intervention, if it is meaningful and if he actually delivers upon it. Two big ifs. “If through his intervention he can help restore the sovereignty of Ukraine, and get Russian troops out of that country, I’m not going to be critical of that.” A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles in what would be another step-up in military support for Kyiv against Russia’s invasion. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine – a group of countries including Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden – set up to send weapons to Kyiv, Reuters reports. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, which runs the fund, asked companies to get in touch if they could provide missiles that can be launched from land, sea or air with a payload of between 20 and 490kg (44 and 1,078lbs). The notice asked for other desirable requirements including a “low probability of intercept”, “mission planning capability”, and “air defence penetration methods to increase probability of successful strike”. The notice said companies that responded would be contacted from 5 June. A British official said no final decision had been made to send missiles with these capabilities to Ukraine. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). In a statement this afternoon, the DoD said: This USAI package underscores the continued US commitment to meeting Ukraine’s most urgent requirements by committing critical near-term capabilities, such as air defence systems and munitions, while also building the capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces to defend its territory and deter Russian aggression over the long term. This includes committing additional 155mm artillery rounds and sustainment support to enable Ukraine to better maintain its on-hand systems and equipment. The package includes funding for additional air defence systems and munitions; equipment to integrate western air defence launchers, missiles and radars with Ukraine’s air defence systems; ammunition for counter-unmanned aerial systems; 155mm artillery rounds; commercial satellite imagery services; and support for training, maintenance and sustainment activities. A large installation representing Russian atrocities in Ukraine blocked the path of Russia’s ambassador to Poland as he sought to place a wreath at a Warsaw memorial to Soviet soldiers on Russia’s Victory Day holiday. The installation included hundreds of fluttering blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and crosses serving as symbolic grave markers for Ukrainians killed by Russians during the full-scale war launched by Moscow last year. A pool of fake blood below the crosses underlined the stark message of the protest, which was created by Euromaidan-Warszawa, a citizens’ initiative that supports Ukraine. One organiser, Viktoria Pogrebniak, said the installation, set up for the day at the entrance to the Red Army memorial site, was meant to fight back against Russian propaganda and “show the real picture to the world”. “We are bombed, we are killed, we are raped,” she said. “We are killed just because we are Ukrainians.” A tumultuous year of fighting has passed since Vladimir Putin last addressed Russian soldiers on Red Square in Moscow to mark the country’s victory over the Nazis. But the Russian leader’s Victory Day message to the nation on Tuesday was nearly identical to that of last year, as he cast the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against an aggressive, Russophobic and woke west. “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive turning point. A real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said as he delivered an angry yet somewhat routine speech in which he drew false parallels between today’s fight with Ukraine’s “criminal regime” and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Putin also recycled some of his other go-to grievances, blaming “western globalist elites” for “destroying the family” and “traditional values”. What was left unspoken by the Russian president was the battering his army had received over the last 12 months in Ukraine, the impact of which was revealed by the scaled-down military parade that followed his speech. It’s 4.20pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the day’s news so far: Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. He accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Popko said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack, which was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told that he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Russia may be building a water pipeline in an attempt to address a water shortage affecting the occupied city of Donetsk. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its daily update that water had been a growing issue for Donetsk since the invasion in February 2022. On 28 April, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk said regional supplies were running “dangerously low”. The Siversky-Donets canal that supplies the area is mainly under Ukrainian control, despite Russian attempts to take command of it. It runs near the city of Bakhmut, which has seen heavy fighting from both sides as Russia tries to take it. The MoD said: “Russia’s heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut … has likely inflicted collateral damage to the canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia’s efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. “To compensate for its lack of success in capture and retaining the canal, Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage within Donetsk city. However, this is unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied region’s reduced access to water.” Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. Her comments were rebuffed by Qin, who said China would neither “watch the fire from the other bank” nor “add fuel to the fire”. Baerbock said the EU was still working on ways to stop sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals being circumvented, including by using indirect companies in other countries. She was asked whether the measures would include a proposed blacklisting of several Chinese companies. In response she said negotiations were ongoing but that generally it was important to stop restrictions from being bypassed. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force which is fighting Russia’s battle in Bakhmut, has said he was told that he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He since rowed back on it, but again threatened to do so unless he got it. His latest comments were released on Russia’s Victory Day, as a military parade took place in the capital, Moscow. He said: “A combat order came yesterday which clearly stated that if we leave our positions it will be regarded as treason against the motherland. That was the message to us. “[But] if there is no ammunition, then we will leave our positions and be the ones asking who is really betraying the motherland. Apparently, the one [betraying Russia] is the person who signed it [the order to supply too little ammunition].” He said his forces would stay in Bakhmut and keep insisting they get their ammo “for a few more days”. Prigozhin has previously accused the defence ministry of deliberately starving his forces of ammunition. The ministry has said it is working to ensure all battlefield units have what they need. Late on Monday, Prigozhin said there were signs the ammunition problem was being solved, but on Tuesday he said the size of the shipment had been slashed. “They’ve given us only 10% of what we asked for. We’ve been deceived,” he said. More details from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference alongside the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Tuesday. He was heavily critical of restrictions on the import of grain into the EU imposed after complaints by a group of five central and eastern European countries. He said the ban was helping Russia. He said: “All restrictions on our exports are completely unacceptable right now. They only reinforce the abilities of the aggressor. We are waiting for the EU to stop all restrictions as fast as possible.” Agence France-Presse said he called the measures “severe, even cruel” and “disappointing” in a time of war. The EU members involved – Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia – have sparred with Ukraine in recent weeks over the issue of grain. Russia’s invasion last year severely limited the traditional export channel of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, necessitating export overland via Ukraine’s neighbours. Member states agreed to allow the import of certain products from Ukraine without quantitative restrictions, and without customs and official inspections. But farmers in some of the EU countries protested after a slump in prices, prompting a raft of restrictions and bans on Ukraine’s food exports in response. Brussels called the bans on imports of grain and other food from Ukraine “unacceptable” while Kyiv is at war with Russia. Last month, the European Commission reached an agreement with all the parties concerned to ensure the transit of Ukrainian grain exports through EU countries, but with restrictions. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen on Tuesday described the grain situation as “difficult”. “The immediate priority now is that the grain transit goes seamlessly and at the lowest possible cost outside from Ukraine towards the European Union,” she said. “This requires a very close cooperation of the different stakeholders. Therefore, we will jointly set up a coordination platform.” MEPs voted to speed up consideration of a law to boost ammunition production in Europe to the tune of €500m ($550m), due to efforts to supply Ukraine. The decision should see the new legislation – snappily termed the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (Asap) – in place by the end of the year, MEPs and European Commission officials said, Agence France-Presse reports. The spending proposal, initiated by the commission, comes as the bloc seeks to supply 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months, adding to a stream of military deliveries. But shifting such quantities of munitions to Ukraine has severely depleted stocks in EU member countries’ arsenals, creating the need for the new ammunition-production act. The Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, in a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Asap law would “help member states to ramp up the production … and speed up the delivery of ammunition to meet Ukraine’s and member states’ needs”. The draft legislation calls for tapping the EU’s European defence fund and another mechanism the commission has suggested creating under a July 2022 proposal, called the European Defence Industrial Reinforcement Through Common Procurement Act. In a first, Ukraine has received Israeli-made radar defence systems, which have already been deployed in Kyiv as of Monday, according to Israeli media reports. A Lithuanian volunteer organisation known as Blue/Yellow delivered 16 ieMHR models made by Israel’s RADA Electronic Industries last week and three are already in use in the Ukrainian capital, the Israeli daily Ha’aretz said. The systems are designed to detect aerial threats including missiles, rockets, mortar shells, helicopters and drones within up to a 10km (6.2-mile) radius. The models function as an alert system, and do not have interception capabilities. According to the Blue/Yellow group, the mobile and stationary systems will be used mainly to protect critical installations and infrastructure. Israel has provided millions in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the invasion began last February. However, wary of the need to maintain relations with Russia – which facilitates Israeli operations against Iranian-backed actors in Syria – it had refrained from sending military materiel despite repeated requests from Kyiv and Washington. The Russian deployment of Iranian-made drones, however, appears to have toughened Israel’s position. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was reelected in November, had also pledged to reassess the country’s stance on the war. Israel has offered to assist Kyiv in creating a “life-saving civilian early-warning system” to protect against aerial attack and has reportedly shared intelligence on Iran’s drone programme. Export licences for two Israeli companies to sell defence systems with a 40km range were approved in March, Israel’s Walla news site reported, citing three Israeli and Ukranian officials. Previous Russian Victory Day military parades have seen a fleet of tanks processing through Moscow’s Red Square in a show of military strength. In contrast on Tuesday, only one was on show, a T-34 Soviet-era tank. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. He also expected the EU to remove trade restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine, after the trading bloc put measures in place after complaints from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Zelenskiy told reporters the moves were “harsh” and “protectionist”. He added that he expected a “positive appraisal” of Ukraine joining the EU at its summit in June, and he thanked European countries for the promise of 1m artillery shells. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. Sky reported: Mr Shmyhal visited a British military training area on Salisbury Plain to watch British and New Zealand troops helping to train Ukrainian recruits as part of a British-led assistance programme to turn thousands of Ukrainian civilians into soldiers. Asked whether some of the recruits learning shooting and other skills would be part of the counter-offensive when they returned to Ukraine, the prime minister, speaking in English, said: “On this training base, our future soldiers – guys and girls – are … having all special knowledge and experiences, practical experiences, for the battlefield.” As for why it was taking so long for the Ukrainian military officially to begin its offensive, Mr Shmyhal said: “We are preparing very carefully because it’s a very important operation and we understand that we should demonstrate success in this operation to our society, to our partners, to all the world [and] to our enemy.” The EU must not be intimidated by Moscow’s showcasing of military power but continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Tuesday as Russia marked Victory Day with a parade. “Two thousand two hundred kilometres north-east from here, Putin is parading his soldiers, tanks and missiles today,” Scholz told lawmakers in a speech at the European parliament in Strasbourg. “We must not be intimidated by such power plays. Let’s remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. “Unfortunately, I don’t think peace negotiations are possible at the moment,” he said. “Both sides are convinced they can win. This was a Russian invasion that was against international law and against the United Nations charter, but I don’t see Russia being willing to pull out of the territories it’s occupying at the moment and I think Ukraine is hoping to retake them.” Guterres said the UN was instead doing what it could “to have a dialogue with both sides to solve concrete problems”, such as Ukrainian grain exports and Russian food and fertiliser exports. The secretary general played down hopes of Chinese or Brazilian mediation to bring about an end to hostilities. “I’ve already said that peace negotiations aren’t going to happen at the moment,” he said. “But I hope they will in the future. There was talk of a Russian winter offensive and a Ukrainian one in the spring; it’s clear that both sides are completely involved in the war.” Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine “Today, civilisation is again at a decisive, turning point, a real war has been unleashed against us again,” Putin said in a speech that was laced with anger. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” he said. Putin accused the west of “destroying traditional values” and propagandising a “system of robbery and violence.” “The goal of our enemies, and there is nothing new here, is to achieve the disintegration and destruction of our country,” he said. More than 500 Russian soldiers who fought in Ukraine were present at the parade, according to state media. Six leaders of former Soviet states were also present. In a surprise move on Monday, the heads of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia – three post-Soviet countries that Moscow strives to keep in its orbit – announced that they would attend the military parade on Red Square alongside Putin. “Here is to our victory!,” Putin exclaimed before returning to his seat. Vladimir Putin said a “real war” was again being waged against Russia, as he invoked the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war to say the west was trying to destroy his country. In a speech on Red Square as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations, Putin said Russia wanted to see a peaceful future, and said the entire country was behind what Russia calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin said the west had forgotten the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Vladimir Putin has started his speech as part of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations in Moscow this morning. The president walked from the Kremlin to Red Square to be greeted by massed ranks of military personnel on Tuesday as the start of a Victory Day celebrations to mark the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Victory Day is one of the most important public holidays in Russia, when people commemorate the huge sacrifices made by the Soviet Union during what is called the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45, in which about 27 million citizens died. This anniversary is even more emotionally charged as Russia mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine, which shows no sign of ending. Here are some images from Russia’s Victory Day parade in Moscow today. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US. North Korea has forged closer ties with the Kremlin and backed Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last year, including its proclamation later of having annexed parts of Ukraine, which most UN members condemned as illegal. “We send warm wishes to you, the Russian army and the people of Russia for their holy fight to preserve world peace,” the agency quoted Kim as telling Vladimir Putin in a letter. Kim also congratulated Putin on Tuesday’s Victory Day anniversary that celebrates the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany, saying Russia would continue to protect its “autonomy” and the “stability of the region”. The leaders of the G7 nations must condemn any threat to use nuclear weapons and vow “decisive action” against such a move when they hold a summit next week in the city of Hiroshima, Ukraine’s envoy to Japan said. Nuclear tension has surged since the start of the conflict with Ukraine as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal if necessary to defend its “territorial integrity”. Sergiy Korsunsky also told Reuters that conditions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had deteriorated rapidly, a situation the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned at the weekend had become “potentially dangerous”. “It should be a very clear statement from specifically those nuclear powers among the G7 that the use of nuclear weapons or nuclear terrorism will not be tolerated and will be met with almost decisive actions from major powers,” he said. The envoy’s comments came as Russia launched drone, missile and airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other cities in the run-up to its cherished Victory Day holiday today that celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will attend by video link the G7 gathering from 19-21 May in Hiroshima, which in 1945 became the first city to be hit by an atomic bomb, adding significance to his country’s message. “It’s most important that the summit, when we have a real threat of nuclear terrorism, that summit will be in Hiroshima,” Korsunsky added. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has arrived in Kyiv, where she will meet Zelenskiy. Ukraine will be celebrating “Europe Day” along with the countries of the European Union it hopes to join. This year’s Victory Day in Russia is emotionally charged, Reuters reports, as the country mourns thousands of soldiers killed in the nearly 15-month war in Ukraine that shows no sign of ending. Russia is also reeling from drone attacks, including one on the Kremlin on 3 May that it said was an attempt to assassinate Vladimir Putin. Ukraine denies involvement. Putin has repeatedly likened the Ukraine war – which he casts as a battle against Nazi-inspired nationalists – to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Hitler invaded in 1941. Ukraine says this is absurd and accuses Russia of behaving like Nazi Germany by waging an unprovoked war of aggression and seizing Ukrainian territory. There have been reports of fewer soldiers and less military hardware joining this year’s parade as the Ukraine conflict takes a heavy toll on men and equipment. Authorities nationwide have cancelled the “Immortal Regiment” processions, where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against the Nazis. Dame Melinda Simmons has posted a photograph of dawn in Kyiv this morning, after another night of air raid sirens and sheltering. “I guess one advantage of an early morning air raid is the chance to see this,” she wrote. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has condemned this morning’s attack, saying in a tweet: “Ukraine, Europe, and the United States commemorated victory over tyranny yesterday. Russia marks May 9 with more missiles and drones launched toward Ukrainian cities and sleeping civilians.” Ukraine’s armed forces have just said in their update that 25 missiles were launched by Russia across Ukraine overnight, with 23 of those shot down. Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said that according to preliminary information there were no casualties in the attack that was carried out with cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea region. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said debris fell on a house in the Holosiivskyi district in the south-west of Kyiv, but there were no casualties and not much damage. In the often-targeted Shevchenkivskyi district of central Kyiv, debris was found on a road, Reuters reports. “Kyiv stood up again and will stand up in the future!” Popko said. Russia launched about 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came a day after Russia launched its biggest drone swarm yet in a renewed air campaign unleashed 10 days ago after a lull since early March, Reuters reports. It also came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Russia launched 15 cruise missiles at Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, the second attack in as many days, with air defence systems shooting all of them down, officials said, after air raid alerts blared over most of the country. “As at the front, the plans of the aggressor failed,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. Tuesday’s attacks came on Russia’s Victory Day, one its most commemorated public holidays, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “[They] try to kill as many civilians as possible – on this day,” Popko said. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: A Russian missile strike overnight on Monday destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement added. On Monday at least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Kyiv’s mayor said Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones early on Monday, including 36 at Kyiv, all of which had been shot down. However, debris hit apartments and other buildings, injuring at least five people. Russia has in effect stopped the Black Sea grain deal, which expires on 18 May, by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry said. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement, which is meant to help ease a global food crisis. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, the spokesperson for the eastern group of the armed forces of Ukraine, told Ukrainian TV they were “rough calculations”. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged eastern Ukrainian city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Russia’s Victory Day on Tuesday. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. A close associate who was in the car with him was killed. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the past three years, according to UK intelligence. The EU’s executive has proposed blacklisting several Chinese companies and curbing exports to nations seen as involved in bypassing Russia trade restrictions under new sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/28/no-immediate-power-price-relief-for-households-and-businesses-as-australias-energy-ministers-meet","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-28T07:57:24Z","webTitle":"No immediate power price relief for households and businesses as Australia’s energy ministers meet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/28/no-immediate-power-price-relief-for-households-and-businesses-as-australias-energy-ministers-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/28/no-immediate-power-price-relief-for-households-and-businesses-as-australias-energy-ministers-meet","fields":{"bodyText":"Households and businesses will get no immediate relief on their utility bills after Friday’s meeting of energy ministers, with discussions instead aimed at ensuring electricity and gas supplies will be ample next winter. Federal, state and territory energy ministers gathered in Melbourne for an update on power and gas markets, and to discuss progress on creating some form of a capacity market that would bolster the reliance of the energy sector as coal-fired plants exit. One measure agreed was an amendment of the national gas law to give the Australian Energy Market Operator the powers to “ensure supply of gas over the coming winter and beyond”, the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said at the meeting’s end. “The crisis around energy markets right around the world is of course having an impact on Australia,” Bowen said, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggering a jump in global coal and gas prices which are feeding into domestic energy costs. “We all have levers at our disposal and we intend to carefully and methodically use these levers … wherever they put downward pressure on prices,” he said. “The cheapest form of energy is renewable energy and the faster we get transmission built, the faster we get renewable energy built, the faster we get new storage built, the better our country will be.” According to the communique of the meeting, governments would “consider all options to take strong action as a matter of urgency”, without specifying new steps. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup Interest in the ministers’ gathering was heightened after the federal budget, which was released on Tuesday, warned that electricity prices would rise on average about 20% this fiscal year and 30% next year. Gas prices, already up 20% in 2022-23 would rise a similar amount in 2023-24, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. The impact on rising energy bills also showed up in the spike in consumer prices, with gas prices alone jumping more than 10.9% in the September quarter. Without state rebates in Western Australia and elsewhere, power bills would have jumped 15.6%, the ABS said. Lily D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s energy minister, said that unlike under the Morrison government, states and federal ministers were working as one. “Added together, they make for a mighty, mighty effort, and real growth in terms of our ambition,” she said. D’Ambrosio, though, said that while gas production costs in Australia had not changed, prices had doubled. Industry groups have said contract prices have tripled in the past 18 months. “This can only mean gas producers are making obscene profits at the expense of every household, at the expense of every business, at the expense of every manufacturer,” she said. “It’s not a supply issue, it’s an absolute profiteering issue.” Discussion on solutions had been “fruitful”, D’Ambrosio said, without providing details. One person familiar with Friday’s discussions said the next energy ministers’ meeting, planned for Gladstone in Queensland in December, “is the place where everything would come together”. Between now and then, ministers would be briefed by officials on the shape of a possible capacity market that would support electricity supplies when generation from wind and solar sources was low. Such a market, though, would “not serve as a backdoor to prop up coal”, the person told Guardian Australia. Ministers, including Bowen, were keen not to exclude options that might be useful later on, while identifying that measures without careful research would only foster expectations that might not be delivered on, this person said. Bill Johnston, WA’s energy minister, said his state’s households were facing an increase in their power prices of just 2.5% this year, with a $400 rebate actually making the bills shrink. The state’s reservation of 15% of gas supply for domestic use, in place since 2006, meant WA had “probably the lowest gas prices in the world”. A capacity market for electricity also meant prices were more stable, Johnston told Guardian Australia. Adding a reservation policy for gas in the eastern states now, though, would be difficult since the LNG export infrastructure had already been built, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/oct/18/the-ghost-pm-what-the-papers-say-about-liz-trusss-hold-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T00:51:14Z","webTitle":"‘The ghost PM’: what the papers say about Liz Truss’s hold on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/18/the-ghost-pm-what-the-papers-say-about-liz-trusss-hold-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/oct/18/the-ghost-pm-what-the-papers-say-about-liz-trusss-hold-on-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s reversal of tax cuts and prime minister Liz Truss’s fight for survival dominated the UK front pages on Tuesday. The Guardian describes Jeremy Hunt’s tax cut reversal as “one of the most astonishing U-turns in modern political history” after the chancellor “shredded” Liz Truss’s economic plans. “Astounding U-turn on tax,” the headline reads, outlining how tax rises and spending cuts will be on the agenda including a new deadline to the energy price freeze. Downing Street sources told the paper that prime minister Liz Truss met chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, to discuss the scale of MPs’ anger. “Humiliated” the Mirror says. The paper writes that the mini-Budget has been “dumped in a catastrophic humiliation” to the PM as one Tory says Truss has “poured petrol over everything”. The chancellor will confront the cabinet on Tuesday with a demand to find spending cuts to restore the UK’s economic credibility, says the Telegraph. “We must take decisions of eye-watering difficulty,” the paper quotes Hunt’s warning to MPs. The PM’s hold on power is “precarious” as Tory rebels plot to oust her, it adds. The Mail leads on Truss’s perilous position in parliament and her “grovelling apology” for economy blunders. “Truss was warned on Monday night that she was ‘in office but not in power’”, the paper reads. The PM acknowledged that she had gone “too far and too fast” with her economic strategy and has been trying to rally support from her MP. The Financial Times also centres its coverage on Truss’s tenure as PM, speculating her future is “on a knife-edge”, as her economic policy was ripped up in a bid to calm markets. The Express leads with the apology Truss gave to the BBC’s Chris Mason on Monday night. “I’m sorry....we went too far and too fast,” the headline quotes Truss as saying. “I do want to accept responsibility and say sorry, for the mistakes that have been made.” The Sun opts for a particularly evocative description of Truss as “the ghost PM” alongside an image of the embattled Tory leader. Truss sat “ghostlike” as Hunt shredded her tax cuts but vowed she would not quit, the paper reports. The Times highlights the £5,000 in energy bills British families could face after Truss was “forced to rip up her economic plans” after Hunt’s announcement on Monday that the energy price guarantee will come to an end in April. Taking a decidedly lighter tone, the Star draws a tongue-in-cheek reference to its ‘lettuce-cam’: a live feed of a 60p Tesco lettuce that asks the question ‘Can Liz Truss outlast a lettuce?’ “Lettuce Liz on Leaf Support” the paper’s headline reads alongside an iceberg lettuce donning a wig on a hospital bed. “With her ailing premiership on leaf support, wet lettuce Liz Truss has apologised for her kamikaze mini-budget but pledged to beat the odds and outlast the Daily Star lettuce,” the paper adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/28/queensland-government-pledges-to-end-reliance-on-coal-fired-power-by-2035","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T05:54:21Z","webTitle":"Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/28/queensland-government-pledges-to-end-reliance-on-coal-fired-power-by-2035","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/28/queensland-government-pledges-to-end-reliance-on-coal-fired-power-by-2035","fields":{"bodyText":"Queensland will end its reliance on coal-fired power by 2035 under a 10-year $62bn energy plan to create a clean “super-grid” of solar, wind and hydroelectric power. In a historic announcement for a state known for its coal mining, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said Queensland was facing a “climate emergency” and a bold vision was needed. Palaszczuk said her government was committing an extra $4bn to transform the state’s energy system and by 2030 there would be at least 2,000 more wind turbines and 35m more solar panels in the state. By 2035, there would be eight times more renewable energy generation than today. In a speech in Brisbane, she said: “It’s about changing the game. Action on climate change. Action on our economy. Action we can all take part in and action we can all be proud of. Queensland – it’s our time to shine.” Two new targets would also be legislated, Palaszczuk said. By 2032, 70% of the state’s electricity would come from renewables, rising to 80% by 2035. She revealed the state wanted to build the world’s largest pumped hydro plant west of Mackay, with 5GW of round-the-clock storage, with a first stage to be completed by 2032. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Workers at the state’s eight publicly-owned coal-fired power plants would be protected with a $150m “job security guarantee” to either keep working at those sites or find new careers. Coal plants would be turned into clean energy hubs and, by 2035, the state would no longer rely on them for electricity. Projections showed coal providing no power at all after 2037. Government and private investment of $62bn was estimated to be needed, with power generation being majority publicly-owned. Household annual electricity costs would be $150 less under the plan, the government said. The state’s second preferred pumped hydro project, west of Mackay, would be known as the Pioneer-Burdekin. Another pumped hydro plant, announced earlier this year, is being targeted for a site near Imbil west of the Sunshine Coast. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said the two plants combined would be bigger than the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme. “We will use cheap solar electricity during the day to pump water up the mountain to store it. Then at night we can release the water to generate electricity,” Miles said. “It’s like a giant battery.” Palaszczuk also pointed to the state’s hosting of the Olympics and Paralympics 2032, saying Queensland would deliver “climate positive” games. Queensland energy and renewables minister, Mick de Brenni, told the Guardian the state’s move away from coal marked a historic moment. “This is an incredibly significant day in our nation’s history,” he said. “Today Queensland commences the transition in an orderly way so that there’s no reliance by 2035 [on coal].” The plan’s release comes only days after the premier announced the state was investing $776m to build the country’s biggest publicly-owned windfarm in the state’s west. Studies previously questioned whether Queensland was on track to meet its initial target of 50% renewables by 2030 – as the pace of private investment stalled, and the government showed a lack of appetite to hasten coal closures. Maggie Mckeown, of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the announcement was “a major turning point for the government” but the plan could be stronger with earlier investment in batteries. “Six gigawatts by 2035 is a great start,” Mckeown said. Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the renewable industry’s Clean Energy Council, said the plan would “set Queensland up to be a world leader on clean energy.” Half of the state’s eight coal power stations are less than 20 years old and almost entirely publicly-owned. The state gets 65% of its electricity from coal, 14% from gas, 18% from solar and wind and 1.5% from hydro power. Action on emissions in Queensland would be significant nationally, but Palaszczuk made no new commitments on a state-wide target. Queensland has the highest emissions of any state, but its 2030 emissions reduction target of 30% based on 2005 levels is also the weakest behind the 50% goals of New South Wales and Victoria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/the-worst-deal-in-history-and-an-albanese-snub-paul-keatings-most-memorable-calls-at-the-press-club","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T07:06:16Z","webTitle":"The ‘worst deal’ in history and an Albanese snub: Paul Keating’s most memorable calls at the press club","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/the-worst-deal-in-history-and-an-albanese-snub-paul-keatings-most-memorable-calls-at-the-press-club","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/the-worst-deal-in-history-and-an-albanese-snub-paul-keatings-most-memorable-calls-at-the-press-club","fields":{"bodyText":"The former Labor prime minister Paul Keating had a tetchy and vituperative outing at the National Press Club on Wednesday. We bring you the most memorable moments of his attack on the Aukus deal, along with the invective he directed at media and his own side of politics. 1. The ‘worst deal’ in history In a written statement on Wednesday, Paul Keating opened by describing the $368bn Aukus nuclear submarine plan as “the worst international decision” by a Labor government since Billy Hughes tried to introduce conscription. In conversation at the National Press Club, the Aukus deal had sunk even lower to “the worst deal in all history”. For $360bn Australia is receiving eight nuclear submarines when it could be buying 40 to 50 Collins-class submarine replacements “for the same price”, he argued. 2. Britain ‘looking around for suckers’ Keating mocked Australia for aligning itself with the UK, reprising familiar criticisms of the colonial masters telling Australia “you’re all on your own” in their East of Suez policy in 1968 after the “capitulation of Singapore” in 1942. Turning to modern times, Keating said “after the great problem of Brexit, after that fool, [Boris] Johnson, destroyed their place in Europe … they’re going to put together ‘global Britain’”. “So they’re looking around for suckers.” “We’re returning … Rishi Sunak, for God’s sake, Rishi Sunak, for Australia to find our security in Asia. I mean, how deeply pathetic is that?” 3. Nuclear submarines ‘don’t snort’ Keating described the defence minister, Richard Marles, and the head of the Australian navy trying to convince him of the benefits of nuclear submarines because, unlike conventional subs, they don’t “have to put up the snort every night to get the oxygen”. “I said, ‘admiral, please don’t think I’m stupid. You only need to put the snort up if you’re going at full power. If you’re just cruising, you put your snort up every four days or so’.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Keating conceded that “it may be more risky than 40 years ago” to operate conventional submarines but argued “if you have 15 of the things at sea, how would knocking one out matter”. “But if you knock one of the three nuclear subs out, it really matters! But they don’t snort. But they’ll be found because they’re bulky.” 4. Albanese snubs Keating Keating criticised Anthony Albanese particularly for the decision in September 2021 to offer unqualified support for Scott Morrison’s plan to ditch the French submarines in favour of the Aukus nuclear submarine plan. “The prime minister thought a gigantic shift of this kind deserved less than twenty-four hours’ analysis,” Keating said in a written statement before the speech. He did praise Albanese for being “responsive to calls, texts and email” in the past – although his luck seems to have run out after he sent the prime minister a “long paper” about sovereignty on 2 February. “I received no reply to this correspondence.” Keating also spoke to Albanese’s staff on 21 February inviting him to discuss Aukus. “The fact is he did not wish to hear the message or have the conversation.” 5. Marles and Wong ‘seriously unwise’ Keating criticised the defence and foreign ministers, Marles and Penny Wong, as “seriously unwise”. Wong “spent five years [in opposition] rustling not a leaf” and went along with Aukus determined to prevent a “khaki election”, Keating said in the statement. He supplemented this by arguing Wong had decided “there should be no opening for Liberal party to attack on strategic policy” – folding in with Julie Bishop and the Liberals and deciding to run the “smallest small-target strategy”. “Marles, though well-intentioned, completely captured by the idea of America, couldn’t wait to join the pile on,” he said. 6. Keating gets personal with SMH and Age Keating labelled the Sydney Morning Herald columnist Peter Hartcher a “psychopath” for running “the attack on me about me being a representative or putting the views of the People’s Republic of China” (which Keating rejected). Keating also labelled Hartcher the “old acid drop” and “the great stentorian voice” but suggested he lacked the “stentorian mind”. Then it was the foreign affairs and national security correspondent, Matthew Knott’s, turn, when Keating lashed him for asking him to criticise China over its treatment of Uyghurs and Hong Kong. “After what you co-wrote with Hartcher last week in that shocking presentation … you should hang your head in shame,” Keating said. “I’m surprised you even have the gall to stand up in public and ask such a question, frankly. You ought to do the right thing and drum yourself out of Australian journalism.” Knott replied “for the record, Mr Keating, we’re very proud of our journalism and we think that that has made an important contribution to the national debate” before pressing for an answer on Xinjiang and Uyghurs. 7. Keating minimises human rights concerns Keating brushed aside human rights concerns about China by arguing there are “disputes about what the nature of the Chinese affront to the Uyghurs” is, in reference to documented abuses that the UN has said are likely to be “crimes against humanity”. Keating deflected a follow-up question by arguing that “[Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi, has the same sorts of problems as the Chinese have” but the media are a “soft touch on India”. “What if the Chinese said, what about deaths in custody of Aboriginal people in your prison system? Wouldn’t that be a valid point for them?” 8. France offered new deal Keating revealed that France, which lost a contract for conventional Attack-class submarines in favour of Aukus, had offered “a new deal” for the “newest French nuclear submarines”. These would require only “5% enriched uranium, not 95%, weapons grade” and came with a “firm delivery date” of 2034 at “fixed prices”, he said. The French received “no response”, Keating claimed. The French embassy in Canberra declined to comment on the submarine offer claims. Marles was also contacted for a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/27/israel-binyamin-netanyahu-power-jail-hard-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T15:40:52Z","webTitle":"Israel deserves better than Netanyahu’s bid to retake power and stay out of jail | Lloyd Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/27/israel-binyamin-netanyahu-power-jail-hard-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/27/israel-binyamin-netanyahu-power-jail-hard-right","fields":{"bodyText":"As Israel heads to the polls on Tuesday for its fifth election since the spring of 2019, its politics are fractious, but stop short of visceral acridity. The country’s rival tribes are content to jostle each other. It’s an eerie quiet before what could be a terrible storm. With just days to go, Benjamin Netanyahu and the right lead in hypothetical match-ups, but may fall short of the 61 seats needed in the 120-member Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to dislodge Yair Lapid, the current prime minister. As for Lapid, his chances of securing an outright victory are slim. Talk on the street is of a Seinfeld election – much ado about almost nothing. The country is tired. Yet there is greater internal consensus than one would glean from the rhetoric bandied on the campaign trail. And overarching all of that is a greater concern – that Netanyahu is basically using the re-election as a way of short-circuiting the criminal prosecution he faces on charges of corruption – and that the electorate may let him do so. The epic contests between Netanyahu and the late Shimon Peres, the successor to Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995, or Ariel Sharon and Ehud Barak, two decorated generals, remain in the memory but are the stuff of yesteryear. The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is devoid of a pulse, and no one within the Israeli mainstream is clamouring for its resuscitation. There seems less to fight about. The Oslo accords collapsed under the weight of the second intifada. In the intervening decades, Israel has emerged as a hi-tech hub possessing a military unrivalled by its neighbours’ combined forces. Meanwhile, the recent Abraham accords have resulted in expansive economic ties, trade and investment between Israel, on the one hand, and the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Confronted with the threat posed by Iran, an entente of sorts binds Jerusalem and Dubai. Being the enemy of my enemy may make you a friend. It can also be lucrative. The accords, however, are not immune to the strains emanating from Israeli politics. The emergence of Jewish supremacy as a rallying cry for the Jewish right, and its leaders entering a Netanyahu-led government scares people. Axios’ Barak Ravid reports that Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, foreign minister of the UAE, conveyed his concern to Netanyahu about the leaders of the Jewish Power party, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. The two cast themselves as an insurance policy against encroaching modernity, Arabs and gay people. Both are Jewish supremacists. Netanyahu refuses to be photographed with them. Smotrich recently branded Netanyahu a congenital liar. Yet they are bound together in their disdain for the left. More problematically, the pair demand senior portfolios. Will Netanyahu buckle under pressure or hold his ground? That is one of the campaign’s unanswered questions. He has good reason for acting as their Trojan horse to respectability. By trading cabinet posts with them, and forming a government, he may be able to contrive his own immunity. With his bribery and corruption trial unlikely to wind up for another year, they could effectively be his “get out of jail free” card. The UAE’s concerns carry weight, particularly among members of Israel’s reality-based right. Jason Greenblatt, Donald Trump’s first Middle East envoy, glowingly praised the UAE’s president, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ), in his 2022 memoir, as “most humble and thoughtful”, and “wise and extraordinarily open-minded”. More to the point, MBZ’s personal net worth is pegged as $30bn, his family’s wealth exceeds $150bn. His money talks, people listen. Netanyahu has wriggle room. If he prevails, it is possible that he may choose to provide missile defence systems to Ukraine in exchange for the Biden administration staying off his back if he chooses to put Ben Gvir and Smotrich in his cabinet. He knows Ukraine is the Biden administration’s priority. But even then, Netanyahu has a way of annoying, if not angering US administrations. James A Baker III, George HW Bush’s secretary of state, barred him from the State Department. In 1996, Bill Clinton reportedly exclaimed: “Who the fuck does he think he is?” Arab-Israelis and the Palestinians form another part of a complicated equation. In the 2021 election, Israel’s Arabs provided the votes needed to see Netanyahu thrown out of office, but 20 months later, that same constituency appears dispirited. With days to go, one hopes for a jolt that will bring the election to life and remind everyone what is at stake. For now, the stasis benefits only the looming possibility of Netanyahu’s return, the opportunity he represents for the hard right and the obscenity that he may use it as a shield to protect himself.

They’ll be pitching for a historic fifth term, which is ambitious even in the best of times. That there have been three prime ministers in this term alone is one of the least dramatic points of this period. The current occupant of Number 10, Rishi Sunak, is trying to persuade his MPs to stick with him at least until that election, with many of the brightest and best considering quitting before they get shoved by their voters. In less than two years’ time, Sunak will be advancing an argument for why the electorate should stick with him, too. But what can he possibly say? Once a party is in government its best election pitch is to say to voters that it’s safest to stay with the devil they know, rather than risking the opposition party. Party leaders tend to point to everything they’ve achieved, before asking voters for more time to finish the job. Sunak has two problems with this. He doesn’t have a lot to point to in the way of Conservative achievements from the past decade and a bit. It’s also not entirely clear what the job is that only the Tories can finish, given his focus on fixing a mess made far worse by his own party. Recently, I’ve taken to quizzing senior Tories about what they feel is their party’s big legacy from their time in government. Their responses follow the same pattern. A long pause. A sigh. “Well, there’s Brexit. And we can be really proud of what we’ve done with education. We need to talk about that more.” And then another pause. Some, after a little head-scratching, also mention universal credit, saying that this huge and lengthy welfare reform has changed the benefits system for the better and made people excited about getting back into work. The Tories do need to talk about these two early achievements, especially their decision to continue the New Labour education reforms beyond the ambitions of their original architects. Michael Gove has had many incarnations since being education secretary, but his legacy in that job will outlast everything else he’s done – besides campaigning successfully for Brexit. Gove wasn’t the architect of “levelling up”, but that tends to be the next big reform that Conservatives mention when they reflect on the past decade. They don’t, though, talk about it with the same sense of pride. Instead, it’s with a great deal of regret that they reflect on their failure to produce anything tangible in time for the next election. Levelling up will be one thing the Tories will ask voters to stick with them for so they can finish the job. But there are only nascent signs of it beginning, which means it is still very difficult for the party to say “look at what we’ve achieved so far”. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt thinks it is worth pursuing, but is keen to change the model entirely. His approach would be to allow elected local representatives, particularly mayors, to be able to solve their infrastructure problems locally, without having to bang down doors in Whitehall by bidding endlessly for small pots of money here and there. This follows the old “northern powerhouse” approach of the David Cameron government, where city regions won more powers over local services, but it has its political problems. Talk to any Conservative in Greater Manchester, for instance, and they will be spitting tacks, not just about Andy Burnham, but about George Osborne for creating the elected mayoral post that has made him, in their view, such an unaccountably powerful figure. In 2014, when Osborne was on the brink of announcing his northern powerhouse and the directly elected mayoral post, 1922 Committee chair and Altrincham MP Graham Brady warned him the night before that he would be making it harder for the Tories to build support in the city region because it would create a local Labour celebrity who wouldn’t be properly scrutinised or achieve anything meaningful. Those Tories and others will see Hunt’s move as injecting the already powerful Burnham with political steroids. Burnham took on devolved responsibility for the NHS, but there has been little evidence this has made any improvements for patients in Greater Manchester. It has simply become a microcosm of the national problems with the health service: long waits for elective treatment and ambulance queues caused in part by a social care sector so dysfunctional it is an inaccuracy to call it a “system” as that would suggest some kind of coherence. The Tories will not be able to trumpet their achievements in the health service between 2010 and 2024. The best they can hope for is that the public, most of whom will be on a waiting list or caring deeply about someone who is, will agree the backlog is caused largely by Covid rather than long-term mismanagement of the health service by the government. The NHS isn’t the only institution with a backlog blighting lives and baffling practitioners who are trying to get to grips with delays. Last week, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, divided his time between defending complaints about his behaviour and responding to questions from MPs about the horrendous waits in the criminal justice system. The numbers aren’t as eye-watering as in the health service: 61,000 cases waiting to go through the courts, and more than 7 million waiting in the NHS. But victims of crime are having to wait years before they give evidence in distressing cases. Here’s one example from Labour MP Meg Hillier, in the Commons last Tuesday: “One of my constituents was violently attacked and given a court date three years later. Her seven-year-old witnessed the attack, and the perpetrator keeps pestering her, breaking non-molestation orders, leaving the police pretty powerless, because he knows there is no traction.” Raab claimed that the backlog had been going down until strikes by criminal barristers, which Hillier, who is chair of the public accounts committee, also disputed. Either way, there is little legacy in justice that the Tories can boast about. A cynic might point out that court backlogs don’t have the same salience as the NHS – which is also one reason the criminal justice system has been so neglected for so long. Another secretary of state who was answering awkward questions last week on a matter that upsets voters was Suella Braverman, who was grilled by MPs on the home affairs committee about illegal immigration and asylum seekers and failed to give answers on what is a safe, legal route to claiming asylum in this country, before facing official figures showing net migration at a record high. This high-immigration legacy might not matter so much if Braverman and the party had committed to it being a part of their post-Brexit vision, but instead they’ve spent the past decade sticking doggedly to a target randomly made up in opposition, of net migration in the tens of thousands, despite ample evidence they will not meet it. It’s like a runner boasting that they will complete a marathon in two and a half hours, but who doesn’t train and tries to run the course in a pair of Crocs. At least most of the party is cheering on attempts to deal with the Channel crossings, which Tories and Labour see as being the real bit of immigration that voters get angry about. That’s in contrast to the Tory legacy on housing, where they’ve spent the past decade working against one another in such a spectacular fashion that at any stage you could read a story about planning reforms failing amid a furious row. This is happening again as more planning reforms are on the brink of failing, with ministers and whips alike expecting Gove to cave into rebels led by Theresa Villiers who want to make top-down housing targets merely advisory. Many Tories have signed Villiers’s amendment because they think the latest reforms will cost them their seats. Some, though, have merely done so because, in the words of one of their number, they’re “a bit bored”. Sunak and his colleagues are having conversations with bored and desperate MPs this week as many decide whether to stand at the next election. He is offering them a glimpse of the argument he will present to voters about sticking with the Tories. One wavering MP describes the PM’s pitch thus: “There is a path, we can get there, but people are going to have to stick with the party. Stay positive, stay loyal. We have done the first difficult bit on the economy and things could look up from here. If we get on with the job and govern competently, things will look different.” Not many MPs genuinely believe that the Tories will win the next election, but they believe the fervour with which Sunak says it and hope this means they can at least restore their reputation as a party even if they lose. If voters only remember the greatest hits and forget the messes, that will be a defeat worth celebrating – not least because it seems unlikely. • Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The new Nationals leader, David Littleproud, made a claim this week that some viewers may have taken to mean that one such CCS project was ready to go. Speaking with the ABC Insiders host, David Speers, Littleproud was trying to defend the Morrison government’s energy and climate policy, which he said was about “not only protecting gas [but] protecting our coal industry as well with carbon capture and storage”. Littleproud gave an example: “You can look about 60km west of where I’m sitting now and carbon capture and storage is being implemented on a coal-fired power station from Millmerran,” he said. “That’s the investment we made in giving investment certainty and making sure that we had reliable energy. Complementing that with renewables and also gas.” There is a CCS plan involving the Millmerran coal power station, but to describe it as “being implemented” is something of a credibility stretch. The plan at the power plant, operated by InterGen, comes in two parts. Neither is close to being under way commercially. The first part is to “capture” some CO2 after the coal has been burned. A factsheet on the project, known as CTSCo and run by coalminer Glencore, was released in January and said an engineering design study had been done. But that’s a long way from a working project being “implemented”. The second part involves trucking the supercooled CO2 by lorry 260km to CTSCo’s tenement in the Surat Basin where Glencore says it has drilled at least two tests. The company has not yet submitted an environmental impact assessment or gained any environmental approvals for the project, but says CO2 transported there could be stored in a geological formation 2.3km below the ground. In June last year, Littleproud announced the Morrison government had given $5m to the CTSCo project, which was first raised by Glencore in 2010. In April this year, Glencore said it had received a further $25m in taxpayer money for the project. Yesterday, Glencore announced two more commercial partners in CTSCo – each pitching in $10m – and said after environmental assessments it was “working towards the commencement of CO2 injection in 2025”. The other 98% Littleproud defended the former government’s energy policy as “sensible” and pointed to projects like the one at Millmerran as an example. What impact could it have on emissions at the power plant? According to Glencore, the project has the potential to capture 110,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. But according to the Clean Energy Regulator, the Millmerran coal-fired power station released 5,257,559 tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2020-21. So even if the facility at Millmerran gets built and works (and there is somewhere to store the CO2), it will capture only 2.1% of the coal plant’s annual emissions. What happens to the other 5,147,559 tonnes of CO2-equivalent? Don’t look up. Don’t mention Paris The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, announced his new shadow ministry this week, with the pro-nuclear MP Ted O’Brien in the climate and energy slot, assisted by Senator Hollie Hughes. This is the team Dutton has chosen to respond to an election defeat where voters chose candidates and parties with more ambitious climate plans. Hughes told the ABC she was “not personally in favour” of extending the Coalition’s 2030 emissions reduction target, which has been set in stone for the past seven years – a 28% cut between 2005 and 2030. Labor’s target is 43%. Why did Hughes not want to extend the Coalition’s target? “Because Australia is 1.3% of the entire global emissions, we could shut everything down tomorrow and go and live in trees,” she said, apparently trying to minimise Australia’s contribution to the climate crisis (not mentioning, obviously, the country’s position as a leading exporter of coal and gas). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “You can’t have it both ways,” Hughes said. “You can’t say we want to boost energy supply but we’re going to shut everything down.” As if this needs pointing out: nobody is saying that, because that would be dumb. But here’s another thing you can’t “have both ways”: you can’t sign up to an international agreement with more than 190 other countries and agree to submit your annual emissions to the UN every year, and then sign up to another agreement promising to keep improving your targets over time (all of which the Morrison government did), but then say that your emissions don’t matter and that you won’t improve your target. Actually, you can. But it gets you an international reputation as a climate action laggard, fewer MPs and senators in parliament, and the prefix “shadow” to go with your job title. Cheap nuclear? An online headline in the Daily Telegraph this week read: “Majority of Aussies say it’s time to go nuclear to save money, planet.” Whoever smashed out that headline appears not to know much about the cost of power generation. According to US-based financial adviser Lazard, which produces reports on the cost of electricity generation, nuclear is – in most scenarios – among the most expensive ways to generate electricity in the world, and two to three times more expensive than solar and wind. Dutton’s new shadow climate minister, O’Brien, and Littleproud have both been advocates of so-called “small modular reactors” – partly on the grounds they could provide cheap energy. But CSIRO’s latest GenCost draft report says there is “no prospect of a plant being deployed before 2030” and it expects by then the capital costs of SMRs to be in the region of $7,700 per kilowatt – which is more than five times the cost of large-scale solar, three times the cost of onshore wind and more than 10 times the cost of batteries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/04/colombian-president-gustavo-petro-allies-resign-amid-wiretapping-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T14:49:02Z","webTitle":"Colombian president’s allies resign amid illegal wiretapping scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/04/colombian-president-gustavo-petro-allies-resign-amid-wiretapping-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/04/colombian-president-gustavo-petro-allies-resign-amid-wiretapping-scandal","fields":{"bodyText":"Two of Gustavo Petro’s closest political allies have resigned as the Colombian president’s office was embroiled in a bizarre scandal involving a nanny, illegal wiretaps and a missing briefcase full of cash. Petro’s closest adviser, Laura Sarabia, and his key political power broker, Armando Benedetti, stepped down on Friday after an investigation by the general attorney into allegations made by Marelbys Meza, the nanny to Sarabia’s son. Meza told local media last Monday that she had been taken to a basement next to the presidential palace in January, accused of stealing a briefcase containing $7,000 from Sarabia’s apartment and forced to take a polygraph test. On Thursday, Colombia’s general attorney office said investigations had revealed that intelligence services tapped the phones of Meza and another domestic worker contracted at Sarabia’s home. Meza’s phone calls were listened to for 10 days in a “grotesque” abuse of power in which the police wrongly labelled the women as members of Colombia’s largest drug cartel, the Gulf Clan, said the general attorney, Francisco Barbosa. “It is a regrettable day for the rule of law, illegal wiretapping has returned to Colombia,” Barbosa said. Four police officials were questioned on Friday as to who gave the order to surveil the women despite them not being a risk to national security, the attorney’s office said on Friday. Investigators searched the basement where Meza took the lie test. Petro, who was elected last year as Colombia’s first leftist president, has denied that government officials ordered illegal wiretaps, and pledged at a military event on Friday to support the inquiry. “The doors of the palace are open to any investigation, we don’t have any fear,” he told a crowd of senior naval officials in Cartagena. Local reports suggest Meza is at the centre of a bitter power struggle between Benedetti, 55, a key conservative power broker who allied with Petro to help bring him to office, and 29-year-old Sarabia, who worked under Benedetti before leading Petro’s campaign. According to a report in the weekly Semana magazine, Benedetti and Sarabia clashed over Benedetti’s request for a new posting. Among the more peculiar details of the intrigue, Benedetti flew Meza to Caracas on a charter plane to work at his residence after Sarabia sacked her. But the nanny was employed by Petro’s right-hand woman only after Benedetti himself had fired her for suspected theft. Benedetti says Sarabia asked him for help to stop Meza going to the press while Sarabia alleges Benedetti leaked the story. Sarabia has denied wrongdoing in relation to what she said were reimbursed travel expenses. Petro denied that any administration official gave wiretapping orders but said he sympathised with Sarabia for carrying out the polygraph and that Meza consented to the test. The scandal is the first to break the trust of Petro’s innermost circle and has dented the president’s popularity, which has slid from 50% in November last year to 34% now. The former guerrilla has struggled to secure peace deals with armed rebels and deliver sweeping reforms, and has been embarrassed by a series of Twitter gaffes and public spats. Petro called for his entire cabinet to resign in April after his health reform proposal was shot down and in May he incorrectly tweeted that four children lost deep in the Amazon jungle had been rescued. The Colombian right capitalised on the Sarabia scandal to accuse Petro of hypocrisy after he campaigned for decades against state spying on the political opposition, journalists and judges. “Who gave the order?” tweeted the far-right congresswoman Maria Fernanda Cabal, mocking the phrase used to protest against systematic extrajudicial killings under the former conservative president Alvaro Uribe. Unfortunately for Petro, the man leading the investigation is Francisco Barbosa, one of the president’s growing list of enemies. Petro was drawn into a public spat with the rightwing attorney last month after wrongly asserting that he was the independent investigator’s boss. To stem the crisis, Petro could appoint more leftwing loyalists to office but the move would further break his cross-party alliances and constrict his ability to bring political reform, said Sergio Guzman, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis. “Petro is trapped between his huge ambitions for change and Colombia’s rigid legal structure and institutions who have few incentives to move forward reforms that affect them,” Guzman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/27/climate-campaigner-ejected-from-labour-event-sponsored-by-drax-power-plant-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T12:30:10Z","webTitle":"Climate campaigner ejected from Labour event sponsored by Drax power plant firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/climate-campaigner-ejected-from-labour-event-sponsored-by-drax-power-plant-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/27/climate-campaigner-ejected-from-labour-event-sponsored-by-drax-power-plant-firm","fields":{"bodyText":"An environmental campaigner has been ejected from an event sponsored by the power station operator Drax at the Labour party conference after criticising the company’s use of biomass. The owner of the North Yorkshire power station sponsored a debate on Tuesday on Britain’s net zero climate goals on the fringes of the political party’s conference in Liverpool. The company’s group director of corporate affairs, Clare Harbord, was on the panel. Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing and argue that its biomass operations, which burn wood to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. The talk in Liverpool was titled “Reaching net zero: how can the UK boost energy security and invest in green jobs?” Several campaigners interrupted the discussion to question Drax’s green credentials. One woman was forcibly removed from the room while she said: “How can you talk about net zero and green jobs as the UK’s biggest carbon emitter and the world’s biggest tree burner?” Another said: “As the largest carbon emitter in the UK, how can you talk about net zero and green jobs when you’re responsible for the destruction of forests around the world?” Drax was accused of being part of a “culture of spin for climate criminals” by another audience member, who said: “How dare you be here, it’s a disgrace.” The incident happened a day after the Guardian reported that the UK government had been accused of funding environmental racism by giving £2m a day in subsidies to an energy company that has paid out millions over claims it breached pollution limits in the US. Drax denies it committed any violations at its Louisiana plants, after agreeing to the settlements without accepting liability. An investigation by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigative unit, found Drax Biomass paid millions of dollars to US regulators over claims it exceeded limits on chemicals emissions at wood chip plants close to black and low-income communities. One person at the Liverpool event referenced the report and said: “All you are doing is pushing this so you keep on burning trees and polluting communities. You’re polluting communities in southern America, in southern US … these are poor, mostly communities of colour and you are polluting them.” The panel was originally due to include Alan Whitehead, the shadow minister for the green new deal and energy, but the shadow business and industry minister Bill Esterson attended instead. Drax argues that its biomass is made from sawmill residues and low-grade wood left behind when forests are harvested for wood used in other sectors such as construction. A Drax spokesperson said: “A very small number of people attending the event tried to disrupt the discussion and were unwilling to listen to the views of the panellists who were in agreement that in order to reach net zero the world needs to use a range of energy solutions including wind, solar, biomass and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. “Climate change is the biggest challenge this generation faces. Over the last decade Drax has reduced its carbon emissions from fossil fuels by almost 100% using sustainable biomass.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/oct/06/born-to-exist-review-joseph-toonga","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T08:07:28Z","webTitle":"Born to Exist review – a celebration of women and the power of krump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/06/born-to-exist-review-joseph-toonga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/oct/06/born-to-exist-review-joseph-toonga","fields":{"bodyText":"‘Why can’t you see me?!” cries the woman looking out into the audience, racked with frustration. “See. Me.” Joseph Toonga’s Born to Exist puts a spotlight on women unseen, specifically the women who raised him, having moved to east London from Cameroon as a child. Toonga started out in hip-hop, studied contemporary dance and has recently been working with the Royal Ballet, but his heart is in making eye-opening political work that speaks to real life. Following Born to Manifest and Born to Protest, two shows exploring black experience, this is the final part of the trilogy, subtitled The Woman I Know. It doesn’t explicitly tell the stories of Toonga’s family but it seems a portrait of struggle, strength and survival. There are images of anger, violence, resilience and support. The choreography draws on hip-hop and particularly the power of krump, the women’s bodies driven by fevered contractions and gesticulations. At one point the dancers repeatedly raise their arms and you see the short distance between a fist raised in power and a palm raised in alarm, as if these two modes are in delicate balance. Born to Exist is unafraid of confrontation, but the energy is just as charged when the three women on stage stand stock-still in silence as when they’re shouting expletives. Brazilian Amanda de Souza – a particularly sharp dancer – speaks volubly in Portuguese, enunciating each syllable but unable to make herself understood. Not just unseen, but unheard. It’s a piece that can hold the attention with minimal means: no set, just an empty stage, lights, haze, subtle swells of music from Mikey J Asante. It starts with a single dancer, Aisha Webber, charismatic enough to spend the first five minutes with her back to us, slowly circling shoulders and hips. But it’s also a piece that perhaps struggles to make its larger point. There are very strong moments, but it loses traction – at one point the dancers talk among themselves in a way that says nothing to the audience. If Toonga really wants to celebrate and illuminate these women, it feels like we’re missing a final act. • Touring until 26 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/26/the-power-of-women-acclaimed-italian-author-elena-ferrante-on-patriarchy-and-protest-in-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T16:27:20Z","webTitle":"The power of women: acclaimed Italian author Elena Ferrante on patriarchy and protest in Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/26/the-power-of-women-acclaimed-italian-author-elena-ferrante-on-patriarchy-and-protest-in-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/26/the-power-of-women-acclaimed-italian-author-elena-ferrante-on-patriarchy-and-protest-in-iran","fields":{"bodyText":"Shiva Akhavan Rad is an Iranian freelance journalist. She worked as a psychologist before starting to write about film and culture in local Iranian newspapers and magazines. Elena Ferrante is the pseudonymous author of many books, including the four-volume Neapolitan Novels, which tell the story of two girls, Lila and Lenù, born in Naples in 1944, who try to create lives for themselves within a violent and repressive culture. Here the two discuss protest, patriarchy and the power of women. Rad Iranian women are living in a terrible condition. They take off their headscarves in protest against the mandatory hijab and walk the streets without covering their hair and without fear of arrest. Some of them go further and burn their headscarves and this is a sign of a big change in Iran. In my opinion, being a woman in Iran is a political act. That’s why some people believe that the movement that has formed in Iran today is the first feminist revolution in the world, which introduced itself with the slogan “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” (woman, life, freedom). We live in a patriarchal environment and after reading your Neapolitan Novels and seeing the TV series I felt many similarities between the atmosphere of Iran and the atmosphere of Italy at that time, and I strongly psychologically identified with the characters of Lila and Lenù. I’m wondering what Lila and Lenù would do if they lived in Iran in these turbulent days? Or what would you do if you lived in Iran? Ferrante What can I tell you? Lila would certainly be in the frontlines, and Lenù, in order to keep up, in order not to miss anything , would follow her, even to prison, and to death. As for me, I would be ashamed to make any claims: I’m far away and in a safe place. But for weeks I’ve been following what is happening. The repressiveness is terrible, but it’s wonderful that people so diverse in age and in social class and culture are standing side by side, resisting. I find the centrality of women especially exciting. The motivations of Iranian women are the just and pressing motivations of all those who today, in Iran and in the world, fight for dignity and autonomy, for the freedom to decide how to dispose of their own bodies, their own lives. I am moved in particular by women who expose themselves to danger wholeheartedly, with absolute determination. To demonstrate at the risk of one’s life takes great courage, extreme desperation, a glimmer of hope. I’ve always admired those who openly confront the violence of power, and I always wonder if I would be capable of it. I think of myself as timid, but I can’t tolerate anyone who instils fear in me. Citizens should strike fear into their repressive rulers: the opposite enrages me. And rage, in general, makes me forget fear. Thus – I imagine – if I were there, I would be in the streets, like Lila, with passion and rage; but also like Lenù, out of duty, the need to see, to understand and try to describe. Rad In the first volume of the quartet, My Brilliant Friend, Lila tells Lenù about her conversation with Pasquale: “He explains about the things that happened before us… We don’t know anything, neither when we were children nor now. Therefore, we are not in a position to understand anything.” I think one of the main themes of the novel is that we don’t learn from what happened in the past, therefore we repeat the historical mistakes of the previous generations. Lila understands that her parents know nothing about the past and the history of Italy, neither about fascism, nor about justice, oppression and exploitation. Lila is looking for historical awareness, but she is a victim of a traditional family system, patriarchal society, and the criminal gangs like Camorra. I think history is important in the lives of these characters. In Iran, the freedom movement and the struggle against tyranny have been always there since the constitutional revolution. Progressive and national forces, as well as the leftists, have always been suppressed by different governments, however the people’s struggle for freedom has continued in various forms throughout history. And now the young generation is moving again on another path to reach freedom. In your opinion, how can this historical awareness help the women’s movement in Iran and their emancipation? Is it possible for them to skip the historical mistakes and not fall into the pit again? Ferrante Education is fundamental. Studying, remembering and self-analysis are indispensable for making a conscious choice about the form we wish to give our life. Put like that, though, it’s too linear. We mustn’t forget that every human being is a tangled knot. Different eras, incompatible beliefs, contradictory feelings are all mixed up in us. Here in Europe we tend to simplify the complexity of our pathway to freedom. When we think we’ve won we set aside the pain, the inconsistencies, the unresolved problems. Yet the history that is truly useful to us women is not the history that seems like a triumphal march but, rather, the history that reminds us of the sufferings and injustices endured by past generations: the history ensuring that we render justice to them, that we not delude ourselves on our victories, that we start again after our defeats, and that we remain aware that every generation, even though it learns from the preceding generations, ends up making its own mistakes. We have to be vigilant. No triumphalism. In the west we believe we’ve won certain rights definitively, forgetting that no right – especially for us women – is ever truly won. Rad Italy has a strong tradition of socio-political literature. In Italy, many novels with socio-political and antifascist contexts were written by influential writers such as Ignazio Silone, Cesare Pavese and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Your novels are also created in the same context. Have any of these Italian writers inspired you? In your opinion, what is the difference between your works and their works and why they are so popular in Italy and around the world? Ferrante I learned from women writers more than from men: Elsa Morante, Natalia Ginzburg, Alba de Céspedes, just to mention a few names from the generation before mine. As for my books, I don’t know: I tried to describe the effort made by the women of my generation to invent for themselves – I would insist on “invent for themselves” – a life not subordinate to the culture and power of the patriarchy. Rad Is there a particular reason you write under a pseudonym? Maybe you feel the same way as Lila, who after going through her tragic experiences, writing and fame become a trivial and humble preoccupation for her? I mean, you came to this mentality that fame is not important and that writing anonymously is a kind of rare growth in overcoming fame. Maybe Lila, who is missing and no one knows about her, is now a famous writer who writes under a pseudonym. Ferrante The answer today, as I’m writing to you, seems simple: I did it because avoiding success and fame is one of the many ways of feeling totally free. But I also have a slightly more complicated answer. One is not an author full time. For example, in daily life I do many other small things that are important to me. The urge to write is my moment of greatest truth. I call that moment Elena Ferrante, which for me, and for readers, is my true and only name. Rad It seems that the character of Lila is a woman whose perception of life goes beyond her time and always sees distant horizons, although this does not prevent her from making mistakes, suffering and being a victim – on the contrary, she seems to suffer the most. Is it because you have breathed your soul into this character and that you have had difficult and painful experiences in your life like her? Ferrante My life story is unimportant. For the most part, Lila resembles some complicated women I’ve known and loved, but who are also, at times, hard to take. What can I tell you about them? They are extraordinary and difficult people, seductive and terrible. Their lives are filled with prolonged sufferings and sudden joys; they’re too sensitive. They move quickly and unpredictably, even though they seem motionless. And you can’t really hold on to them even when you try to contain them in writing. Of course, to describe Lila I also drew on myself, on the part of me that I know least and which frightens me. But if I hadn’t settled inside the more controllable Lenù, I wouldn’t have been able to write about Lila. Rad One of the interesting characters in your novel is Antonio, who eventually saves himself from the brink of lunacy and moves to Germany. Now that I look at it, I see that your novel is full of sub-narratives that are deeply explored in the heart of the main narrative and full of melancholic and bitter characters whose lives are literally tragic, and it is your genius in story writing that astounds me. You are the master of creating introverted characters with many complexities such as Antonio, Enzo and Lenù. Did you take these characters from real life or are they coming from your imagination? Ferrante I’ve known them all quite well, for ever. They’ve had chaotic lives, with a lot of inconsistencies and dark corners, as happens in reality. But real human beings are not in themselves a guarantee of solid literary strength. You can bring them into a story only if you find a way of treating them with imagination. Without imagination they struggle to find meaning. Rad You have said once in an interview that violence is a male thing, but the violence that is taking place in Iran today is not only against women, but men are also the victims of state violence and domestic violence. For example, women who cheat on men are actually committing some kind of violence. May I have your opinion on this? Ferrante We women, wherever we are in the world, are immersed in male culture from birth. Language is male, the family is male, religion is male, laws are male, government institutions are male, literature is male, the arts are male, the sciences are male, education – both male and female – is male. What do I mean? I mean that, in all of our manifestations – even the perception of our body, even maternity – we assume the form of a woman through the forms that patriarchal domination has invented for us over millennia. Everything that I, a woman, seek to express moves necessarily from within the male tradition, and violence is no exception. Let’s admit even that female adultery is a form of violence against one’s partner. Well, it’s a violent act that the woman carries out from within a completely male concept of faithfulness and unfaithfulness, a concept based essentially on obsessive surveillance of the female body. It’s this basic violence that makes us feel female betrayal as a violent act and a sin, in this case punishable by death. (Male betrayal is generally regarded sympathetically, considered a manifestation of excessive manly vitality: it’s legitimatised.) Even today, in Italy, a woman who betrays or abandons her partner for another man puts her life in danger. No, no, we have to train ourselves not to take the male for the universal. The human race doesn’t exist: the female race exists, sealed for millennia within the rules of the male race, within the patriarchal culture, which is slow to die even among the most sensitive men, those who stand beside us, with our aims. Even when we women do violence – and now I’m talking not about adultery but about violence in general – we do it according to forms that were designed by men and based on male anxieties and fears. Our forms of violence – if they exist, and I hope not – have still to be invented. Rad Slavoj Žižek, the political thinker, recently in reaction to women’s protests in Iran said: “What goes on now in Iran has a world historical significance: it combines different struggles (against women’s oppression, against religious fundamentalism, for political freedom against state terror) into an organic unity. “Iran is not part of the developed west, so the slogan ‘Zan, Zendegi, Azadi’ is very different from MeToo in western countries: it mobilises millions of ordinary women, and it is directly linked to the struggle of all, men included – there is no anti-masculine tendency in it, as is often the case with the western feminism. Women and men are together in it, the enemy is religious fundamentalism supported by state terror.” What is your comment on this? Ferrante On the whole I agree with Žižek: the adversary is religious fundamentalism, the struggle crosses all boundaries, includes different classes, men and women, etc. But be careful not to forget, in putting together these alliances, that it’s Iranian women who are the engine of the protest. Every women’s fight today has an inevitable core that in my view is the following: we will never be truly free as long as we have to express ourselves, in every field, from within forms of life that are essentially male. What is the gender of those who oppress us, who build despotic theocracies, who deny us our rights? Even when we rebel at the cost of our lives, even when we are the absolute protagonists of our rebellion, we have to beware of the male categories we’re in danger of using to account for ourselves and our rebellion. We have to criticise those categories and search for new ways, our own. Rad Italian society has experienced the terrible era of Mussolini’s fascism and dictatorship, and we have been experiencing similar dictatorship in Iran for years. So I would like to ask you how much you sympathise with the rebellious young Iranians who are fighting against this dictatorship. And are you willing to support them? Do you have a message for them? Ferrante Every struggle that calls for the right to live our own life, assuming total responsibility for our choices and not giving anyone the authority to choose for us, is just and should be fully supported. For what it’s worth, I am on the side of your struggle, especially on the side of women’s right to design in complete freedom their own way of being in the world, whatever it is. Your battle has gone beyond national borders, and is carrying its specific nature into the struggle of all the women in the world. You remind us yet again that no right is for ever, and that the primary objective of power, behind the mask of cruelty, as well as that of benevolence, is always to impose on us new forms of servitude. Rad Lila and Lenù are struggling to have a normal life. They don’t want to go through the same route as their mothers and the other women of Naples. In this sense there is a similarity between them and Iranian young women who fight for a normal life. We Iranian women have longed for a normal life for many years. I lived with the Neapolitan Novels and many times I imagined that there must be a hope for Lila. I wish her life was not so bitter and sad. There seems to be no source of tranquillity for Lila’s super tragic life. If there is, what is it? Ferrante In Lila there is all the need for and all the anxiety about change. It’s as if she were saying: my situation is intolerable, I have to change it, but I grew up in it and if I disrupt it I leave behind not only sorrows but also affections and routines; rebelling is not only good for me but also harmful. Lila, in other words, demonstrates that it’s not easy to go beyond the margins in which we’re confined, and how painful it is – not only joyful – to force open, amid innumerable contradictions, the cages we’ve been shut up in. Will she find peace? No, peace is for those who can settle for partial freedoms. It’s her nature always to seek new limits to overcome, and no matter how hard Lenù tries to stay with her, she’ll lose sight of her in the end. Rad Did you have a teacher or mentor like Pasquale in your life that introduced Lila to fascism, Nazism, and communism? Ferrante Yes, a woman friend of mine. But late, when I was around 20. Rad Did you have a real-life figure like Lila or Lenù that inspired you? Lenù who thinks nothing really important would ever happen to her without Lila. Ferrante Yes, especially in regard to the capacity to persuade yourself to act in a way that on your own would frighten you. Women like Lenù are much more numerous than those like Lila, and that’s good. Lila is a permanent goad. In her everything originates but nothing is settled. She always lives, painfully, within the metamorphosis, and precisely while it’s taking place. Lenù, on the other hand, is the new form that is established after the change. In her the metamorphosis becomes stable, gradually revealing the progress that has been made and, at the same time, its inadequacy. Rad Thank you so much for your time and hope to see you somewhere in the world.

Ursula Andress had her ivory-white bikini with chunky belt buckle in Dr No; Jane Fonda had her sleek one-piece with black stripes and thigh-length boots as the glam astronaut in Barbarella. But the most outrageous piece of sex-symbol costuming of all time was given to Raquel Welch, who was called upon to rock a revealing doeskin two-piece in her role as Loana the Fair One in the 1966 dinosaur adventure One Million Years BC, featuring stop-motion dino action by Ray Harryhausen, and based on the less-than-scientific notion that humans and dinosaurs coexisted. Loana was the ultrasexy cavebabe who had three lines in the film, but the poster image of Welch in this quite extraordinary outfit made her a legend. Welch became naughty-but-nice shorthand for a luscious star that blokes of all ages would secretly or not-so-secretly lust after; a sort of sitcom gag, like dads watching Top of the Pops and waiting for Pan’s People to come on. Kenneth Branagh’s recent movie Belfast has a shot of Welch entrancing a saucer-eyed family audience in this film. And in fact, Welch became even more of a legend in Britain for a publicity stunt in 1972, when – in London to promote her British-produced western Hannie Caulder – she declared herself to be a Chelsea FC fan, dressed up in Chelsea strip for the photographers and went to a Chelsea home match against Leicester City in the itchy-bearded company of Jimmy Hill. Welch was a strong, powerful personality, who didn’t simper or blush but looked permanently amused, as if she could eat any of her admirers for breakfast. In fact, Welch had cult-classic moments before and after her ersatz-Jurassic apotheosis. She had appeared with Frank Sinatra in a now-forgotten mystery called Lady in Cement (and in fact had a tiny appearance in the Elvis Presley film Roustabout). She had been one of the crew in the amazing sci-fi movie Fantastic Voyage, shrunk to microscopic size and sent into the body of an important scientist to repair his brain – and inevitably she had to model a figure-hugging wetsuit. In Stanley Donen’s Bedazzled, with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, in which hapless Dudley sells his soul to the devil, Welch appears as the figure of Lilian Lust who clambers into bed with him wearing ketchup-red lingerie. Welch got no critical respect for her lead performance in the little-liked movie version of Gore Vidal’s novel Myra Breckinridge in 1970: her playing a transgender character is perhaps the least of the film’s problems. But like so many performers stuck with the “sex symbol” job description, Welch had a gift for comedy which was sometimes indulged and sometimes not: she scored a great success with her performance as the sly Constance de Bonacieux in Richard Lester’s all-star Dumas romps The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, having a steamy indiscretion with Michael York’s D’Artagnan. And she has real presence in James Ivory’s Hollywood Golden Age drama The Wild Party from 1975 (an influence on Damien Chazelle’s Babylon), in which she plays the loyal mistress of a has-been star who is hosting an orgy for influential moguls. Her celebrity in the 1970s was colossal and it’s a pity that no film-maker could quite bring out of her that combination of drollery and brassy physical strength that could well have produced a tremendous comedy. But she was an icon: a sexy warrior who was more than a match for human or dinosaur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/06/major-misjudgement-how-the-tories-got-their-energy-strategy-so-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T21:30:35Z","webTitle":"‘Major misjudgment’: how the Tories got their energy strategy so wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/major-misjudgement-how-the-tories-got-their-energy-strategy-so-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/06/major-misjudgement-how-the-tories-got-their-energy-strategy-so-wrong","fields":{"bodyText":"Government industrial strategies are often derided as attempts to pick winners. The UK’s Conservative government has taken a different approach with its new energy strategy. In terms of dealing with the energy bill and climate crises, it’s picking losers. It is crystal clear that transforming the energy efficiency of the nation’s draughty homes should be the No 1 priority. After all, the cheapest, cleanest energy is the energy you no longer use and nothing can be installed faster than insulation. There are huge opportunities – for example, just 40% of UK homes have sufficient loft insulation. But there is nothing new in the strategy beyond an advice website. Former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry calls this a “major misjudgment” that will “force large numbers of very vulnerable people to be cold next winter when they need not be”. The next priority should be renewable electricity, now six times cheaper than that from gas-fired power stations. There are 649 wind and solar projects that already have planning permission. These would save more gas than the UK imports from Russia. But the strategy promises nothing to cut the planning regulations that David Cameron used to strangle onshore wind development and large-scale solar farms. The vast majority of people, including Tory voters, back more wind power in their areas, polling consistently shows. But your future energy bills now will be even higher than they need to be because ministers are worried a tiny minority of people can’t cope with looking at turbines. There is a boost to offshore wind, a genuine British success story, but it is unavoidably more expensive than onshore wind. The “big bet” Boris Johnson has chosen to take is on nuclear power. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said this week that “there is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050. That world is never-never land. Nuclear power is the only major energy technology that has increased in cost in the last decade and routinely suffers from massive time and budget overruns. Even Kwarteng acknowledges that France’s large nuclear fleet “cost a fortune”. The gamble Johnson is making, with taxpayers’ money, is that nuclear power is a more reliable wager to secure clean future power than renewables and fast-developing energy storage technologies. It’s a long shot. Renewables and storage will develop much faster and get much cheaper due to the rapid learning that comes with small-scale technologies, unlike colossal projects like nuclear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on Monday, produced by scientists from across the globe and signed off by 195 governments, mentions renewables, wind, solar and efficiency 67 times in its summary. It cites nuclear once (in brackets), as an example of a technology with high upfront costs. The UK energy strategy also backs more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea – which flies in the face of its own net-zero climate targets. Furthermore, the dwindling reserves that remain cannot lower the price of commodities, which is set by a global market. Don’t just take that from me; Kwarteng, energy minister Greg Hands and COP26 president Alok Sharma all agree. On Monday, after the IPCC report, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “The truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” That is the UK he is now talking about. The only good news is that shale gas has been sidelined, with a review of safety a sop to the small group of noisy frackheads on the Tory back benches. Another of Johnson’s “big bets” is on hydrogen, apparently in the hope that it can be used to heat a third of UK homes as an alternative to fossil gas by 2050. That is folly, not least as heat pumps will be much cheaper and less polluting. Using fossil fuels could produce lots of hydrogen, but also cement our dependence on oil and gas, while belching out CO2. Green hydrogen – produced from renewables – will be very expensive for years, and the limited supply should be reserved for sectors that are really hard to decarbonise. Why has the government got this so wrong? It’s partly short-term politics. An “ally” of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to have defended the refusal to fund more energy efficiency by saying: “We have to be scrutinising every extra penny of taxpayer money that is proposed for spending because ultimately we want to do the Conservative thing and cut taxes for people.” That is, just before the next election. It is also partly the adherence to the dogma that the only solution to problems is “our treasured free-market economy”, as Kwarteng described it on Tuesday. That is despite the warning in 2011 from the government’s own climate adviser that “leaving [energy efficiency] to the market has never worked anywhere in the world”. He was right. The first of two big failed efficiency schemes saw loft insulations plunge by 93%. Most depressingly, the energy strategy’s failings seem also partly due to Johnson’s penchant for big, shiny projects, rather than the hard graft of thousands of smaller ones. But the six or seven nuclear power plants he dreams of are likely to follow the same fate as his island airport, garden bridge, and tunnel to Northern Ireland. Helen Clarkson, at the business-focused Climate Group, said: “We have tools and technologies already available which can radically reduce our energy needs and our carbon emissions now. Energy efficiency measures can deliver immediately in cutting people’s fuel bills and get us on the path to net zero in the longer term. There’s a huge opportunity for a win-win here which the government is passing up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T15:12:42Z","webTitle":"Moscow launches new strikes across Ukraine; Kyiv claims Russia has lost 100,000 soldiers in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement adds. At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, which is Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported.Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. President Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. NATO air policing units were put on a higher state of readiness following a near-miss between a Russian fighter jet and a Polish aircraft on patrol for the EU’s border agency Frontex on Friday, a NATO official said. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official told Reuters: “NATO air policing detachments were put on higher readiness in response to the dangerous behaviour of a Russian military plane in the vicinity of a Polish Frontex aircraft over the Black Sea near Romania.” The official said NATO “remains vigilant” and referred further questions to the Polish authorities. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported. Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. TASS quoted Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-installed governor, as saying: “We’ve seen the level (of water in the nearby Kakhovka Reservoir) rise to 17.8 metres. “We realise that this is manipulation. The nuclear reactors have been suspended.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. A spokesperson said the measure reflected “the escalation of enemy attacks throughout the country and the downing of a reconnaissance drone in Kryvyi Rih, on Saturday. Moscow has intensified air strikes this month as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. It has also vowed to retaliate after blaming Kyiv for an apparent drone attack on Moscow’s Kremlin citadel, for which Ukraine denied responsibility. In Odesa, flames engulfed what the Ukrainian Red Cross said was a 1,000 sq m food warehouse that it was operating. It said all the humanitarian aid stored there had been destroyed, Reuters reports. After air raid alerts blared for hours over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine, local media said explosions sounded in the southern region of Kherson and southeastern Zaporizhzhia. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in the small city of Orikhiv. The Russian-appointed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, said around 3,000 civilians had been evacuated from areas near the front line that had come under shelling in Zaporizhzhia, one of the areas where Ukraine could launch its counteroffensive. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has shared a photo of a missile attack in Odesa. The time is approaching 6pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news as Russian forces destroyed a Red Cross warehouse in Odesa as part of a wave of strikes that hit several parts of Ukraine. A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement adds.

Military call-ups are making the most important times of the arable calendar – the sowing and harvesting seasons – even tougher in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The agency has spoken to Kees Huizinga, a Dutch farmer in the Cherkasy region of central Ukraine, who has seen about 40 of his 350 workers sign up to fight in the war, with their replacements lacking experience. Reuters says Huizinga fears this could mean a fall in grain and milk yields – and, with them, a drop in his income. Three other farmers, a major farm operator and an agrarian association told the agency the military call-ups were affecting them too. They said assessing the impact of staff shortages on output is all but impossible – but just another complication in an already difficult campaign. Ukraine’s grain output – for a long time a driver of its export revenues and of global grain markets – is already down sharply because of a war that has disrupted exports, reduced access to fertilisers and made huge swathes of farmland inaccessible. Steps by Kyiv to ringfence the key agriculture sector from the military draft have had only a limited impact, Reuters reports. Most of the farming sources the agency spoke to said they could get by with replacement workers and employees doubling up on some jobs, but that nothing replaces experience. Huizinga said: You lose some efficiency there. You lose the quality. The 48-year-old, who comes from near the Dutch city of Groningen and moved to Ukraine drawn by its cheaper land prices, said the losses could run to a few hundred thousand dollars or more for his farm. On his 15,000 hectares of land, he has milking cattle, plus young stock, and grows a variety of vegetable and grain crops, having withstood unpredictable weather and price fluctuations among other challenges over the years. Kyiv’s mayor says Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones at Ukrainian targets, including 36 at the capital, all of which were shot down. However, he said debris hit flats and other buildings, injuring at least five people on the ground. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson on Monday, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. Two others were hurt in Antonivka, on Kherson’s outskirts, said military administration chief Roman Mrochko. The two people in Antonivka had been near one of the many “invincibility points” that Ukraine set up nationwide to provide access to electricity, heating, water and other basic services for civilians facing outages caused by Russian airstrikes. Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Kherson last November after nearly eight months of occupation by Russian forces who seized it soon after launching their full-scale invasion. The area now comes under frequent artillery fire from Russian forces dug in on the opposite side of the Dnieper River. Russia has effectively stopped the Black Sea grain deal by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry has said. “The Russian Federation once again effectively stopped the ‘grain initiative’ by refusing to register incoming vessels and carry out their inspections. This approach contradicts the terms of the current agreement,” the ministry said in a statement according to Reuters. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Cherevaty said that Russia had launched about 415 artillery strikes in the last 24 hours. He added that 64 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday. Cherevaty also said that Russia did not seem to be low on ammunition, despite claims to the contrary by the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. “Such statements by the Wagner group leader are most likely connected with the fact that he made too many promises about the capture of Bakhmut and invents this nonsense about ammo shortage since, apart from manpower losses, he has no other ‘victories.’” Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorist offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion on Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. A court remanded him in custody for two months. Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Ukraine and the western states of backing it, particularly the US, for the attack. Ukraine’s security services neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he believed Russian authorities staged the attack. The US state department has not commented on the incident. Russia’s state news agency TASS quoted security sources as saying the suspect was a “native of Ukraine” with a past conviction for robbery with violence. Prilepin was the third prominent pro-war figure to be targeted by a bomb since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia also blamed Ukraine for the deaths of journalist Darya Dugina and war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in the two previous attacks. Kyiv has denied involvement. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced on Monday. The visit on Europe Day reaffirms “the EU’s unwavering support towards the country”, a spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters. “The visit will focus on all the dimensions of our relations with Ukraine,” he added. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. This would mean imposing restrictions on the sale of certain goods to that country if it was believed they were being re-exported to Russia. The plans, which will be subject to intense discussion from EU member states, could yet be watered down amid concern about pushing sanction-targeted countries into the arms of the Kremlin. Since the EU and western allies imposed heavy sanctions on the Russian economy after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc’s exports to its eastern neighbour have fallen sharply. But EU trade with former Soviet countries in the Caucasus and central Asia has jumped, as have some of these countries’ onward exports to Russia – a process called “the Eurasian roundabout” by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has studied the issue. At the same time, Turkey and China have also increased their sales to Russia. EU diplomats are wary of antagonising these countries and pushing them closer to Russia, but there is also understanding that the continued flow of exports is blunting the impact of western sanctions. The issue is the centrepiece of the EU’s 11th round of sanctions against Russia, which otherwise contains few substantial measures. Some EU diplomats argue the EU has little left to sanction, with contentious issues – such as a ban on Russian diamonds and civil nuclear technology – too difficult to agree among the 27 member states. The EU also wants to impose personal sanctions – asset freezes and travel bans – on a further 72 people and 29 organisations deemed to be supporting the war effort. On the draft list are people putting out the Kremlin line on state TV, those responsible for the transportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and two commanders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, who were recently found guilty in absentia by a Dutch court for the murder of 298 people on board Flight MH17 in 2014, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are moving members of the local authority, collaborators, children and teachers from the city of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia to the city of Berdiansk, which is also under Russian control. Parents have been told not to enrol the children into schools if they have refused the evacuation order, according to the General Staff of Ukraine’s daily update. Meanwhile, queues for petrol are in place, with drivers in Tokmak told that no new deliveries are planned. Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Speaking to the nation on a hill overlooking Kyiv, Zelenskiy compared Putin’s Russia to Hitler’s Germany, saying the Kremlin was pursuing “enslavement and destruction”, as the Nazis did, Reuters reports. He said Russia would not succeed. Further cementing Ukraine’s break with its Soviet past, Zelenskiy said he had submitted a bill to parliament officially making 8 May a day of remembrance and victory, while 9 May – when Russia marks Victory Day – would become Europe Day. “We are returning to our state an honest history without ideological influences. It is on 8 May that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis,” he said in a video posted on the president’s Telegram channel. “Today, I signed the relevant decree, and every year from tomorrow, 9 May, we will commemorate our historic unity – the unity of all Europeans who destroyed Nazism and will defeat Ruscism,” he said, using a word Ukrainians have coined to describe what they call Russian fascism. About eight Kh-22 cruise missiles were fired by Russia at Odesa overnight according to Ukraine’s air force spokesperson. Yurii Ihnat said that “some of them did not reach their targets”, the Kyiv Independent reported, as Ihnat spoke on television. He said that they were older Soviet missiles. Despite their apparent age, Russia used the same missile in an attack that hit a residential building in Dnipro on 14 January, killing 40 civilians and injuring over 70. Ukraine’s air force earlier reported that Russian forces had attacked Odesa using Tu-22 M3 long-range bombers from Cape Tarkhankut in Russian-occupied Crimea. The warehouse of a food company and a recreational area on the Black Sea coast were hit, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. No casualties were reported. Russian military recruiters have been targeting central Asian migrant workers in Russia to serve in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Recruiters have visited mosques and immigration offices to recruit. At immigration offices, staff who speak Tajik and Uzbek routinely attempt to recruit migrants. Radio Free Europe reported recruiters offering sign-up bonuses of USD $2,390 and salaries of up to USD $4,160 a month. Migrants have also been offered a fast-track Russian citizenship path of six months to one year, instead of the usual five years. The high monthly salary and sign-up bonuses will entice some migrant workers to sign up. These recruits are likely sent to the Ukrainian frontlines where the casualty rate is extremely high. Recruiting migrants is part of the Russian ministry of defence’s attempts to fulfil its target of 400,000 volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The authorities are almost certainly seeking to delay any new overt mandatory mobilisation for as long as possible to minimise domestic dissent. More photos have emerged of the damage done after Russia launched drone strikes on Kyiv overnight: Russia appears to have ramped up its attacks on Ukraine ahead of its annual Victory Day parade in Moscow on Tuesday, which marks the anniversary of Soviet Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. The celebration has gradually emerged as the centrepiece of Vladimir Putin’s vision of Russian identity over his 23 years in charge. But this year there are signs of unease among the Russian leadership over the celebrations amid fears of Ukrainian strikes, the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer reports from Moscow, after drones operated by unknown people attacked the Kremlin last week. “There is a nervousness that I have never seen before,” said one official at the Moscow mayor’s office. “But Victory Day has to go ahead, there is no other option.” Some images of the damage from last night’s strikes on Ukraine, in which five people were injured in Kyiv. A bit more from the ISW update I posted about earlier. The thinktank’s analysts argue that the latest spat between Wagner and the Russian ministry of defence shows that army Gen Valery Gerasimov, overall campaign commander in Ukraine, and possibly minister of defence Sergei Shoigu “lack the ability to command [Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and [Chechen leader Ramzan] Kadyrov as subordinates but must instead negotiate with them as peers”. The ISW writes further: Gerasimov’s degraded abilities to control his commanders will likely further limit the Russian military’s ability to conduct coherent operations involving different areas of responsibility … ISW has previously assessed that factional dynamics within the Russian military are shaping decision-making to an unusual degree, and the increasing erosion of the Russian chain of command is likely caught in a self-reinforcing feedback loop with the Russian military’s growing factionalism. ISW assesses that Putin is unlikely to remove Gerasimov as overall theatre commander for reputational reasons, and therefore Prigozhin’s and Kadyrov’s public undermining of Gerasimov may have lasting impacts on the power of the overall theatre commander’s position. Prominent pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Writing on Telegram on Sunday, the Russian nationalist said he had been driving and that his assistant was in the passenger seat when the bomb blew up under his assistant’s wheel. Prilepin said he had dropped his daughter off just five minutes before the explosion. “I tell the demons: you will not intimidate anyone. God exists. We will win,” he added at the end of his post. Ukraine says it destroyed all 35 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia in a wave of attacks across the country early Monday. In its usual morning update the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said Russia had also launched 16 missile strikes on cities and regions including Kharkiv, Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa as well as 61 airstrikes. It also reported 52 instances of enemy shelling and said “Unfortunately, there are killed and wounded among civilians, damaged high-rise building, private residences and other civilian infrastructures.” “The probability of further Russian missile and air strikes across Ukraine remains high,” it added. We’re going to pause the blog here for a couple of hours but will of course return to bring you any breaking news. Here are the latest developments: Five people have been injured in Kyiv after Russia launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday. Two of those were wounded when drone wreckage fell on a two-storey building in the city’s west, while drone debris also fell on the runway at the city’s the Zhuliany airport. Explosions were also reported in the Black Sea city of Odesa, where Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said a food warehouse and a recreation area had been set on fire. Further Russian strikes were also reported in Zaporizhzhia and in the southern region of Kherson. Russian Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying he has been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Kadyrov was happy to help Prigozhin in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin, it argued. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, according to UK intelligence. More from that ISW report I mentioned earlier: the analysis suggests that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov was happy to help Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin “blackmail” the Russian defence ministry in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin. The think tank writes: Kadyrov had previously held an influential position within … Putin’s close circle … until apparently losing favor recently, likely because his forces played a limited role in active combat operations in Ukraine throughout late fall of 2022 and winter of 2023. Putin belittled Kadyrov during their meeting on March 13 where Kadyrov appeared visibly nervous when reporting on the Chechen fighters’ role in Ukraine. Kadyrov likely saw Prigozhin’s threats to withdraw from Bakhmut as an opportunity to play up the effectiveness of his forces against the backdrop of Gerasimov’s and Shoigu’s failures to deliver decisive victories during the winter-spring offensive. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed local official in Zaporizhzhia, said that Russian forces overnight also hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in Orikhiv, a small city in the region, Reuters reported. The news wire was not able to independently verify the report. Russia has launched a string of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks, killing dozens of people across the country. Targets have included civilian areas: eight people died in a supermarket in Kherson last week and 23 people, including a baby boy, were killed in the city of Uman when a Russian missile struck an apartment block at the end of April. Russian missiles were also aimed at Odesa, hitting a food warehouse and a “recreation area”, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. He wrote on Telegram: X-22 rockets were directed at the warehouse of one of the food enterprises and at the recreation area on the Black Sea coast. Rescuers are working to eliminate fires. There was no information about the victims. The information is being clarified. More detail on the strikes on Kyiv from Reuters, which reports: Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell onto the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. The Kyiv’s military administration said that drone wreckage fell on a runway of the Zhuliany airport, one of the two passenger airports of the Ukrainian capital, causing no fire, but emergency services were working on the site. It also said that in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district, drone debris seemed to have hit a two-storey building, causing damages. There was no immediate information about potential casualties. Reuters’ witnesses said they had heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It was not immediately clear how many drones were launched on Kyiv. The ISW analysis comes after Reuters reported that Wagner group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had ditched his plans to withdraw from the eastern city of Bakhmut on Sunday after receiving promises that his fighters would receive as much ammunition as they needed. Prigozhin wrote on Telegram: Overnight we received a combat order, for the first time in all this time. We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off [from supplies] will be deployed on the flank. Prigozhin had announced on Friday that his fighters, who have spearheaded the months-long assault on Bakhmut, would pull out because he said his men had been starved of ammunition and taken “useless and unjustified” losses as a result. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. The US-based think tank writes: Kadyrov published a letter on May 6 asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to order Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Director of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvadia) Viktor Zolotov to authorize the transfer of Chechen “Akhmat” units from “other directions” to assume Wagner’s positions in the Bakhmut direction. Kadyrov’s letter to Putin bypassed the Russian chain of command, and the withdrawal of Chechen forces from other parts of the theater likely posed a risk to Russian defensive lines, a risk that [Army General Valery] Gerasimov and Shoigu, or Putin, appear to have been unwilling to take. Kyiv’s local council has sounded the all-clear after Russia carried out strikes on the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday. “Please keep an eye on reports and return to shelter if the siren sounds again,” the city’s administration wrote on Telegram. The strikes come as Russian forces begin evacuating people from the Russian-occupied area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, with more than 1,600 people, including 660 children, evacuated so far, Reuters reported, citing a Moscow-installed local official. Ukraine is soon expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region and on Saturday the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned that the situation around the plant had become “potentially dangerous”. In its morning update on Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces were evacuating local Russian passport-holders. “The first to be evacuated are those who accepted Russian citizenship in the first months of the occupation,” it said in a statement. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. Five people have been injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a fresh assault across Ukraine in the early hours of Monday, with explosions reported in the capital as well as in the Black Sea city of Odesa and in the southern region of Kherson. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three people were injured in the city’s Solomyanskyi district and two others injured when drone wreckage fell on to at two-storey building in the Sviatoshyn district. “Likely as a result of debris falling on a parked car in the yard of a residential building, the car caught fire,” the city’s military administration added in a post on Telegram. “There is a recorded fall of debris on a residential building.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone. At least five people have been wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Monday, city officials have said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were also injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Sviatoshyn, on the western edge of Kyiv, is a historical neighbourhood of the capital. Witnesses said they have heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It comes amid fears for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, as Russia evacuates 1,679 people, including 660 children, from areas nearby. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, warned at the weekend that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” as Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas. Ukraine is expected to start soon a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Other key developments: An explosion was also heard overnight following a missile attack that hit the Black Sea city of Odesa, a local Ukrainian official said, and Ukrainian media reported sounds of explosions in the southern region of Kherson. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow.

On Sunday congressman Joe Courtney, the ranking member of the house seapower subcommittee and the second highest ranking Democrat on the armed services committee, also sought to reassure Australia that concern about joint crewing of nuclear submarines was “overhyped”. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Courtney made the comments before a joint announcement about Aukus plans for nuclear submarine purchases and development by Anthony Albanese, the US president, Joe Biden, and British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego on Monday. Australia is expected to buy up to five Virginia class submarines to cover a capability gap in the 2030s before working jointly on a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design. The three countries first announced the Aukus plan in 2021 as part of efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US and UK agreed to provide Australia with the capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines, resulting in Australia breaking its existing contract to buy conventional submarines from France. Late in 2022 two top US senators warned the Biden administration not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia because it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. But Courtney said that the US had built 21 Virginia class submarines over two decades, with two more to be built this year, and an increased “production cadence” as the program was “back on track” after a slowdown during Covid. “We don’t have to do this tonight, we’ve really got some runway to stand up these programs and I think it’s going to be a transformational enterprise for working people in Australia,” Courtney told ABC’s Insiders. Courtney also rejected the view expressed by the Democratic senator Jack Reed, chair of the US Senate armed services committee, and the former Republican senator James Inhofe, that the purchase of submarines was a “zero-sum game”. Courtney said he was confident Virginia class submarines could be delivered, citing the fact the US submarine production had “grown and contracted” over decades and had delivered four attack submarines a year and ballistic submarines during the cold war. “Right now we realise we’re going to have to do some more outsourcing … in terms of Australia possibly being a contributor, whether it’s steel fabrication, parts and components.” Asked if Australia is more likely to get new or used Virginia class submarines, Courtney said “when it comes out you’ll see” but assured Australia that “what you will get is of the highest quality”. “The shelf life of a Virginia class submarine is 33 years and it has life-of-boat nuclear reactor, it doesn’t require refuelling.” “No one is going to be foisting off clunkers on good friends and allies.” “China’s missile force is really, in my opinion, the real reason that is driving this decision because surface ships right now are so vulnerable and we saw it in Ukraine where two relatively crude short-range missiles took down the flagship of the Russian navy.” “The surface is really a much more risky place and, unfortunately, a diesel or electric [submarine] which was the prior plan has to exist and operate on the surface.” Courtney said there was “bipartisan” support for Aukus in congress, insisting he wanted to “foot-stomp” concerns “about who is in charge and who makes the decisions”. “There is already existing collaboration between the Australian [and US] submarine forces – I’ve seen it personally and no one questions about who is the decision-maker in terms of how your subs operate.” Courtney said Australian crew will be aboard “Virginia class submarines, but that will be for training purposes, not for operational missions where they are basically saluting US officers”. Albanese has repeatedly reassured that Australia will retain full operational control of nuclear submarines acquired under the Aukus pact despite former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull questioning whether they can they be operated and maintained without the support of the US Navy. Courtney said “the notion that there is going to be joint crewing is really overhyped, honestly”. “I don’t [think there will be joint crewing]. Everyone understands we need to train up the Australian sailors and officers in terms of nuclear propulsion. “And when the time comes for the deed, the title to be handed to the government of Australia of a vessel, that again, it is going to be totally with the full understanding that it is going to be under Australian control.” On Saturday, Albanese said the program was also about Australian jobs, particularly shipyard and manufacturing work in South Australia and Western Australia. Albanese said that government will justify the need to increase defence spending to pay for the Aukus submarine program, expected to cost $100bn. “That’s why some of, frankly, the juvenile response of the opposition to some of the fiscal matters that are before us deserves contempt,” Albanese told reporters in New Delhi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/02/britibritish-energy-developers-projects-national-grid-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T14:31:47Z","webTitle":"British energy developers to be told: speed up projects or leave queue for grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/02/britibritish-energy-developers-projects-national-grid-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/02/britibritish-energy-developers-projects-national-grid-solar-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain’s electricity system operator will tell energy developers to get on with their projects or get out of the queue for a grid connection as it struggles to manage the growing backlog of delayed green energy projects. The ultimatum is expected to help speed up the 10- to 15-year wait for a grid connection, which is holding back billions in green investment and threatens to derail the UK’s progress towards its climate targets. The electricity system operator, which is owned by the FTSE 100 energy firm National Grid, has faced fierce criticism for the green energy gridlock but has promised its new reforms could slash up to 10 years from the current waiting time. It said it would tell developers to “get on, get back or get out of the energy queue” to make way for projects that are ready to generate clean electricity for the grid. This means developers that have applied for a connection will need to prove that their schemes are making progress, or risk losing their place in the queue. The company has retained a legal firm to help move aside delayed developers to make way for viable projects. It is also working with the regulator to tweak existing rules that developers can build their own grid connections. The reforms come following growing criticism within the UK’s renewable energy industry over National Grid’s handling of its grid connection queue. MPs revealed last month that businesses in Great Britain were facing waits of up to 15 years to secure a connection to solar power installations, which could pull the plug on the government’s ambition to install 70GW of solar by 2035. The energy regulator Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, last month described the delays as unacceptable and criticised a “legacy of stalled, unviable and often highly speculative ‘zombie’ projects blocking ready-to-go solar, wind and other renewable schemes stuck behind them”. There are about 220 projects waiting to be hooked up to the national transmission system before 2026 but only half of these projects have planning permission and some have pushed back their expected start date by up to 14 years, according to the system operator. Barnaby Wharton, a director at trade association Renewable UK, said: “Grid connection delays are holding back £15bn of investment in offshore wind alone over the course of this decade, at the very time when we need to boost our energy security as quickly as possible and provide cheap power for consumers to tackle the cost of living crisis.” The changes could help “unlock new clean energy capacity faster” by letting projects that are ready to connect to the grid move ahead of projects that “simply aren’t making progress”, Wharton added. In the past National Grid only had to set up connections to the occasional, usually large, power plant – but the green electricity boom has led to many more grid connection applications from hundreds of smaller renewable energy projects. The pace of the UK’s renewables rollout is expected to build to help meet an anticipated 50% rise in demand for electricity across the country by 2035. The government has set out plans to build enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK by 2030, and promised to lift an effective ban on onshore wind farms in England, too. The UK is also expecting to increase the number of subsea cables connecting the grid to neighbouring countries. Zoisa North-Bond, the chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation, a sister company to home energy supplier Octopus Energy, said the new grid reforms were “a positive step” but added that the “devil is in the detail”. “We’re past the point of polite processes. What we need is fresh thinking beyond the concept of ‘a queue’, like concrete dates to implement steps, a firmer stance on prioritising renewables over fossil fuels, and better use of data to show where projects can connect quicker. This will end the gridlock, unlock Britain’s colossal renewables potential and bring down bills for good,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/may/03/tell-it-like-a-woman-review-cara-delevingne-powers-all-female-short-film-package","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-03T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Tell It Like a Woman review – Cara Delevingne powers all-female short film package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/03/tell-it-like-a-woman-review-cara-delevingne-powers-all-female-short-film-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/03/tell-it-like-a-woman-review-cara-delevingne-powers-all-female-short-film-package","fields":{"bodyText":"Who really likes anthology movies? We’re not talking about multistory films like Short Cuts or Wild Tales – those are often good, even great – but those bundles of shorts by different directors. More often than not they are lucky-dip packages of horror stories, but there are also more pretentious upmarket ones, held together by some thin thematic connective tissue, like the Cities of Love series. Tell It Like a Woman’s only obvious unifying concept is that all the shorts were directed by female directors. It’s depressing for starters that this is still considered enough of a novelty to justify calling attention to it, but it’s also a bummer that the films in this particular rattlebag are mostly sketchy, earnest and dull. The opening one, Pepcy &amp; Kim directed by Taraji P Henson, stars Jennifer Hudson as a female prison inmate Kim, who has dissociative identity disorder; her alternate personality (Pepcy) pops up over her shoulder, trying to steer her actions when she’s on the verge of getting released. Hudson’s performance is serviceable if a bit broad, but the editing is hellishly clunky. In Catherine Hardwicke’s Elbows Deep, Dr Tartovi (Marcia Gay Harden) and a nurse don masks and rubber gloves to treat an unhoused woman, Validation (Cara Delevingne, pretty good), who is staying temporarily at a fancy hotel during lockdown in 2020. They remove layer after layer from the mentally ill woman until she’s ready to take a shower, but it’s hard to grasp what the final point is meant to be at the end of this dance of the seven hundred veils and T-shirts. More impactful is one by Japanese director Mipo O, called A Week in My Life, in which single mother (Anne Watanabe) with two small kids struggles to stay on top of her daily routine; the film tells its story with brisk, clear brush strokes. Maria Sole Tognazzi’s Unspoken, which stars the incomparable Margherita Buy (The Caiman) as a harried veterinarian, also shines for tight construction and strong performances. The others, though, are on a spectrum somewhere between insipid and awful, and one can’t help but feel packages like this are not doing a huge amount to further the cause of gender parity in film direction. • Tell It Like a Woman is released on 8 May on digital platforms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/11/japanese-funded-500m-project-to-extract-hydrogen-from-victorian-coal-is-at-risk-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-10T15:00:23Z","webTitle":"Japanese-funded $500m project to extract hydrogen from Victorian coal is at risk, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/11/japanese-funded-500m-project-to-extract-hydrogen-from-victorian-coal-is-at-risk-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/11/japanese-funded-500m-project-to-extract-hydrogen-from-victorian-coal-is-at-risk-sources-say","fields":{"bodyText":"A multibillion-dollar Japanese plan to extract hydrogen from Victoria’s brown coal is at risk of failing due to demands for extra subsidies and a lack of willingness from Japanese customers to sign up for long-term deals. People familiar with the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) project said only a portion of the ¥220bn (A$2.48bn) funding would actually be spent on developing a liquefaction plant in the Latrobe valley and export facilities at the nearby Hastings port. The issue of responsibility for capturing and containing the project’s carbon emissions is also unresolved, with the state government potentially liable. “The money now put on the table by the commercial proponents explicitly won’t go to capturing the project’s carbon or storing it,” Lily D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s climate action and energy minister, said. “100% of that risk … sits with Victorians.” The $500m, decade-long project has claimed several technological breakthroughs, including last year’s first shipment of liquefied hydrogen to Japan. Proponents have argued that using fossil fuels to create hydrogen and sequestering the emissions – so-called blue hydrogen – could lower the price and boost demand, paving the way for a later switch to renewables to create green hydrogen versions of the nascent fuel. Opponents, though, say the cost of capturing and storing the resulting carbon emissions will likely render fossil fuel-sourced hydrogen uncompetitive. Short-term contracts, long-term problems Guardian Australia understands the federal and state governments have been asked for “multiples” of the $50m both have so far invested in a project that is not expected to reach commercial scale before 2030. Worse, the Japanese partners are offering contracts to take hydrogen produced in the Latrobe valley for fewer than five years. The project owners would then have to sign up alternative customers at a time when green hydrogen supplies should already be available. Guardian Australia approached Tim Pallas, Victoria’s treasurer and the government’s most outspoken backer of the Latrobe project, for comment. “We will work with Japan and the commonwealth to further assess the commercial, technical and environmental feasibility of the project,” a government spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the federal climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the Albanese government welcomed “that Japan looks to Australia to enhance efforts to build the global hydrogen industry”, but said Bowen had not received a request to support the next stage of the project and did not comment on the length of the proposed offtake contracts. Jeremy Stone, the non-executive director of one of the Japanese partners, J-Power Latrobe Valley, said the consortium was “grateful for the ongoing support of the Australian and Victorian governments”, but declined to comment on the request for more funding. “The length of offtake agreements will be confirmed once we have finalised our current round of feasibility studies,” Stone said. Japan Suiso Energy, the organisation responsible for clean hydrogen liquefaction, storage and loading in Victoria, is yet to determine how the ¥220bn grant from the Japanese government “will be split between these elements”, he said. The Australian Hydrogen Council, an industry group, said the HESC project would not require renewable energy resources that were needed for other parts of the state’s decarbonisation efforts, labelling it an “alternative pathway” to the “main game” of renewable hydrogen. “We can utilise it so long as there’s a sequestration solution,” said Katerina Aleksoska, the international general manager at the AHC. “If [the Guardian’s] information is correct [and] only short-term contracts are being offered, it will make the project more challenging.” Analysts such as Llewelyn Hughes, a Japan specialist at the ANU’s Crawford school, say a short-term contract contrasts with the long-term deals the LNG industry has signed with Asian customers. Santos’s GLNG venture in Queensland, for instance, underwrote its main operations with a 20-year contract with South Korea’s Kogas. China and Japan have a range of 25-year contracts. “We really don’t know what role hydrogen is going to play ultimately in Japan’s decarbonisation efforts,” Hughes said. “There’s a real risk of some winding back.” Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, who is pouring billions of dollars into developing green hydrogen, said the Japanese investment in Latrobe was “better than nothing” but “I simply wouldn’t do it”. “Carbon capture and sequestration, statistically, has been a massive, abject failure. It literally waits for the next sucker to come along,” he said. Depending on the size of the residual emissions from the project – since not all of them can be capture and sequestered – the venture might also attract costs under the new safeguard mechanism passed by the Albanese government. “The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water is developing an international best practice emissions intensity value for new hydrogen production under the safeguard mechanism,” Bowen’s spokesperson said, adding that new hydrogen producers – if covered by the mechanism – would have to meet baselines or purchase offsets or credits to make up the difference. Victoria’s D’Ambrosio said “it’s a no-regrets investment for the commercial proponents, but we get the added emissions”. “You have to ask: is this a good deal for Victorians?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/28/legalise-cannabis-and-other-progressive-parties-could-hold-balance-of-power-in-victorian-upper-house","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T08:07:37Z","webTitle":"Legalise Cannabis and other progressive parties could hold balance of power in Victorian upper house ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/legalise-cannabis-and-other-progressive-parties-could-hold-balance-of-power-in-victorian-upper-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/legalise-cannabis-and-other-progressive-parties-could-hold-balance-of-power-in-victorian-upper-house","fields":{"bodyText":"The Legalise Cannabis party is leading a group of minor progressive parties in the running to enter Victoria’s upper house, vowing to bring drug reform to the next parliament if it claims the two seats it is hoping to secure.

Legalise Cannabis chair, Craig Ellis, said he was “quietly optimistic”, although was cautious to suggest they would claim seats in the Southeastern and Western Metropolitan regions. “I’m not counting my eggs, we are very cautious,” Ellis said. “The most important thing to say is there are still lots of votes to be counted. On the surface we are very pleased with the level of support we’ve received.” Ellis said the strong primary vote in regional Victoria was driven by their policy to abolish roadside drug testing for cannabis. “It’s a tool of prohibition rather than road safety,” he said. If elected, the party would focus on legalising cannabis, changing the law to allow people to grow their own plants and would also support reform to abolish the controversial group voting ticket system in the upper house. Raue said the primary vote was so large for Legalise Cannabis was partly due to ballot placement. “They did get relatively good ballot draws, that did help a little,” Raue said. “But really they’re an attractive name, it’s a popular issue. I think that’s about it.” Raue also said the “discipline” of the left bloc had meant preference whisperer Glenn Druery’s group had taken a hit – with swings against Derryn Hinch’s Justice party and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers. “Because the left bloc is disciplined, they preference each other and then Labor and the Greens – outside of that it’s hard to get preferences,” he said. Druery defended the early results, saying while he had not done as well as 2018 – when he helped elect eight MPs – his preference deals looked likely to deliver up to five seats. This includes one that may go to the Animal Justice party, which managed to receive preferences from his bloc without reciprocation. “At this point, my efforts have elected the Animal Justice party and the Shooters and Fishers. This is on current numbers,” he said. “That’s a nice little yin and yang right there.” He said the Democratic Labour party could also pick up a seat in the Northeast Metropolitan region, and Somyurek may beat Patten for a spot. Animal Justice party candidate Georgie Purcell said although she was quietly optimistic about winning a seat, early analysis suggested she could have done just as well without Druery’s preferences. “I encouraged the party to preference other progressive parties, and that’s what they’ve done, I’m benefiting from those parties’ preference flows,” she said. “It was still winnable without the flow from the [Druery bloc].” In a statement, Patten said preference deals could help her retain her seat. “On current numbers, I have a slight edge to retain the seat off a strong flow of preferences from the progressive parties,” Patten said. “It will likely come down to below-the-line votes, which I’m glad to say is strong in northern metro, and likely to favour us. “While we are in a good position now there are many more votes still to be counted and the numbers could change.” Controversial Liberal candidate Moira Deeming will enter the upper house, after her preselection was met with criticism within her party largely due to her conservative views on abortion and transgender rights and her criticism of Victorian government’s Safe Schools program. She joins fellow Liberal Renee Heath, who outgoing leader Matthew Guy said would be excluded from the party room after claims were made that she was a lifelong member of the City Builders church, and that it had been directed by its global leader to infiltrate the Coalition. The church, which is led by Heath’s parents, is opposed to gay, transgender and reproductive rights. Heath has denied having the same views as her parents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-10T17:24:15Z","webTitle":"UK energy strategy’s nuclear dangers and glaring omissions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","fields":{"bodyText":"Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has “already been through some form of planning”. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn’t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views. Josie Bassinette Walberswick, Suffolk • In your major article on the government’s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations. Morag Carmichael London • In light of Boris’s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce’s so-called “mini-nukes” to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine. Bob Cannell Bradford • I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don’t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it’s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the “red tape” of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey • If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears. Jon Reeds Alston, Cumbria • A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas. Malcolm Scott Wirral • There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.

The strategy, which has been delayed for a month, was due to be published this week but has now been pencilled for 5 April after disagreement about the multibillion-pound cost of new nuclear plants and amid ongoing tensions between the prime minister and his chancellor, as well as the wider cabinet. Johnson has told the nuclear industry that he wants 25% of electricity generation to come from nuclear power by 2050, up from 16% now. Whitehall sources told the Guardian this shift could require the building of about eight new nuclear power stations. Draft targets suggest ministers are looking at 30GW of nuclear power capacity, meaning a huge building programme would be needed, as capacity is due to fall to 3.6GW as plants are decommissioned. Of the eight UK plants currently in operation, all but one are due to be switched off by 2030. Each new plant would require the government to take a minority stake in the project to reduce the risk to developers, and substantial cash outlay to encourage investment. Despite Johnson’s keenness for new nuclear power, Sunak is concerned about the cost to the taxpayer, or extra costs added to soaring energy bills. The Treasury has already promised £1.7bn of direct cash for a single large-scale nuclear project – the £20bn Sizewell C – as well as £120m for a new Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, which aims to address barriers to entering the sector. Building eight plants could cost more than £13bn in initial investment costs from the government if the same amount of investment were to be put in, according to a Whitehall source. However, the government is also pushing for the nuclear industry to reduce its build costs. Officials also expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, which would be unveiled in the Queen’s speech in May. A nuclear financing bill is already due to get royal assent next week, allowing new nuclear power station owners to get more stable returns and aimed at getting institutional investors to put money in, but the government is still expecting to have to take stakes in new projects. It also allows the cost of new nuclear power stations to be loaded on to household bills – a move that is politically unpalatable given the rising cost of gas and electricity bills. Downing Street sources denied any “showdown” between Johnson and Sunak, who are due to sit down and “talk calmly” through energy strategy issues in the next few days. A Treasury source said negotiations were ongoing and were complex because they involved funding far beyond the current spending round. If an agreement cannot be reached by 14 April then the strategy may have to be delayed until after the May local elections because major announcements cannot be made during the “purdah” period beforehand. There is separately understood to be a disagreement over the Treasury resisting extra money for energy efficiency measures. No 10 is pushing for a big expansion of offshore wind and is “open-minded” about more onshore wind, which would need a loosening of current planning laws. There is less controversy with the Treasury on this issue as renewables do not need additional subsidies. However, many Conservative MPs with rural constituencies are opposed to more turbines in their seats. Under draft plans, there is a move to give communities near onshore wind turbines a discount on their bills and more of a collective say over the projects, rather than permitting them to be blocked by just one individual under current rules. One government source said it was “all about cost” and that the Treasury also seemed keener on battery storage for renewables than on the government taking big stakes in renewable projects. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/putin-flirts-again-with-grim-prospect-of-nuclear-war-this-time-he-might-mean-it","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T14:37:16Z","webTitle":"Putin flirts again with grim prospect of nuclear war – this time he might mean it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/putin-flirts-again-with-grim-prospect-of-nuclear-war-this-time-he-might-mean-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/putin-flirts-again-with-grim-prospect-of-nuclear-war-this-time-he-might-mean-it","fields":{"bodyText":"“This is not a bluff.” The message from Vladimir Putin’s ominous morning speech, which marked the biggest escalation of the Ukraine war since the invasion on 24 February, was clear: Russia is willing to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine continues its offensive operations. While the longtime Russian leader has previously flirted with the grim prospect of using nuclear weapons, experts say his latest statements went further, raising fears around the world of an unprecedented nuclear disaster. Addressing the nation on Wednesday, Putin confirmed he was planning to annex four partly occupied regions of southern and eastern Ukraine after this weekend’s Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums”. He added that he was prepared to use “all means” to defend the “territorial integrity” of the Russian-occupied lands and their people. “Putin’s statements go beyond the Russian nuclear doctrine, which only suggests Russian first use in a conventional war when the very existence of the state is threatened,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher in the Weapons of Mass Destruction and other Strategic Weapons Programme at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. Ukraine, which has been making rapid military gains over the past few weeks, has stressed that it will continue its efforts to liberate occupied lands, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, stating on Wednesday that referendums will “act step by step to liberate our country”. This means Putin’s resolve will probably be tested in the coming weeks. Baklitskiy said the concept floated by Putin of “territorial integrity” was “tricky” given that Russia was planning to absorb four Ukrainian regions, where heavy fighting is taking place. “What would it mean if Ukraine retook the territory Russia considers its own and Putin did not use nuclear weapons in response?” Baklitskiy added. “Coming from the person who has the sole decision-making power regarding Russian nuclear weapons, this will have to be taken seriously.” Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian politics, also said Putin’s nuclear threats were unprecedented but questioned whether the Russian leader was willing to go through with his threats, which would de facto mean nuclear war. “It’s glib to assume anyone claiming they are not bluffing is bluffing, but the credibility of a threat to risk thermonuclear Armageddon if Ukrainian forces continue to move in territories still Ukrainian by law is questionable.” Instead, Galeotti argued, the apocalyptic threats could have been intended to force the west and Ukraine into accepting Russia’s territorial gains in the war. Zelenskiy, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Wednesday, likewise said he did not believe Putin would use nuclear weapons. “I don’t think the world will allow him to use those weapons,” he said. The Ukrainian leader, however, did not rule out the possibility of a Russian nuclear strike, saying “we can’t look into Putin’s head”. For millions of Russians, the most worrying takeaway from Putin’s speech will be that they and their loved ones could soon be fighting and dying for their president’s illusory aims. Since the start of the war, Putin has sought to shield his population from the realities of the war, with the Kremlin eager to cultivate a sense of normality on the streets of Moscow and other major cities. Many responded to these efforts, with polls consistently showing the average Russian was quickly turning away from the conflict. But with the decision to announce the first mobilisation since the second world war and the call-up of 300,000 mostly young Russians, this unwritten social contract has now been annulled, and the war will be entering the households of thousands of families across the country. Nationwide antiwar protests were swiftly announced by the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Wednesday, but with much of the opposition either exiled or behind bars, observers said they did not expect Russians to take to the streets en masse. “Russia’s repressed society will accept this obediently,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Moscow Center thinktank. “They will deal with the issue in their own practical way, avoiding the draft however they can.” On Wednesday morning, some were frantically looking for a way out of the country. Direct flights from Moscow to Istanbul, Yerevan, Tashkent and Baku, the capitals of countries that allow Russians visa-free entry, were sold out, while the cheapest flights from Moscow to Dubai cost about 350,000 rubles (£5,000), a fee too steep for most. Options to leave by land were severely limited this week when four of the five EU countries bordering Russia announced they would no longer allow Russians to enter on tourist visas. Searches for the phrase “How to break your arm” and “How to avoid the draft” increased on Google and the Russian search engine Yandex on Wednesday, another stark indication of the lengths many were willing to go to in order to avoid the draft. The offering of bribes to dodge the army, already a flourishing industry before the war, will probably become much more common in the coming weeks. Wednesday also brought bad news for the thousands of soldiers fighting in Ukraine, a force plagued by issues of morale and discipline. According to a government decree posted on the Kremlin’s website, the contracts of soldiers currently fighting in Ukraine will be automatically extended “until the end of the partial mobilisation” period. “I can’t keep on fighting for ever. Mentally and physically, I am exhausted,” said one soldier, who has been fighting in Ukraine since April and was planning to quit the army once his contract ran out in November. For Kolesnikov, Putin’s latest move is a sign of the growing desperation of a leader who is playing the last cards at his disposal to prevent a military collapse that would pose the biggest threat to his regime since he came to power more than 20 years ago. “This is clearly the emotional and spontaneous decision of a cornered person,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/ukraine-occupied-kherson-loses-power-as-kyiv-mayor-urges-residents-to-prepare-for-total-blackouts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T03:35:44Z","webTitle":"Occupied Kherson loses power, as Kyiv mayor urges residents to prepare for total blackouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/ukraine-occupied-kherson-loses-power-as-kyiv-mayor-urges-residents-to-prepare-for-total-blackouts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/ukraine-occupied-kherson-loses-power-as-kyiv-mayor-urges-residents-to-prepare-for-total-blackouts","fields":{"bodyText":"The occupied city of Kherson has lost power for the first time since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, as Kyiv’s mayor told residents to consider leaving the capital in the event of a complete blackout. In a statement on Telegram, the Russian-controlled Kherson administration said electricity and water supplies were down after a “terrorist attack” damaged three power lines on the Berislav-Kakhovka highway in an occupied part of the region. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, deputy head of Kherson regional council, said about 10 settlements in the region were affected, as well as the main city. Russian officials have said Ukraine is preparing to attempt a second offensive to retake more of the Kherson region. Recapturing it would have immense symbolic and logistical value for Ukraine as Russia wants the area to secure a water supply to Crimea, as well as a land bridge to Russia. The head of the regional administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, blamed Russia for the power outages. He said that in the city of Beryslav in the region, about 1.5km (one mile) of electric power lines had been destroyed, cutting off power entirely because the “damage is quite extensive”. Energy specialists were working to “quickly” resolve the issue, the Russian-backed authorities said, as they called on people to “remain calm”. Kherson’s Moscow-appointed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said authorities hoped to have power back by the end of Monday. News of the outage followed claims on Sunday in Russian state media that the Kakhovka dam in the region of Kherson was damaged by a Ukrainian strike using Himars rockets. In recent weeks Ukraine has warned that Moscow’s forces intended to blow up the strategic facility to cause flooding. The hydroelectric dam was captured by Moscow’s forces at the start of their offensive. It came as Kyiv’s mayor and former boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, said he could not rule out the prospect of a complete blackout for the capital as Russia continued its campaign of strikes on energy infrastructure. Speaking to Ukraine’s United News, a centralised news programme broadcast across all channels, Klitschko told people to prepare by buying power banks and warm clothes. In case of an all-out blackout, he said Kyiv’s residents should try to stay with relatives outside the capital. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time,” he said. However, Klitschko urged people in Kyiv not to be “pessimistic”, saying he was only advising people to prepare for different scenarios. “We will do everything that depends on us so that such a scenario does not happen.” As of Sunday evening, stabilisation blackouts continue in Kyiv and six regions, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Describing the situation as “really difficult” he said more than 4.5m Ukrainians – mostly in Kyiv and the surrounding region – were without electricity. Russian strikes over the past month have destroyed around a third of Ukraine’s power stations and the government has urged Ukrainians to conserve electricity as much as possible. “We are aware of the fact that the terrorist state is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy,” Zelenskiy said in his latest Sunday evening address, referring to Russia. Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital, said Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said. Ukraine’s authorities have issued scheduled blackouts across the country in order to stabilise the grid, and 17 EU countries have sent 500 power generators to Ukraine to help ease the energy crisis. “Probably, there will be no light in Beryslav until the city is completely de-occupied,” he said in a Telegram update on Sunday night. “It is impossible to promptly repair the lines – there is a lack of specialists, equipment, and the Russian invaders will not allow this to be done.” Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/15/staunch-or-stubborn-lidia-thorpe-on-the-voice-the-treaty-and-real-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T19:00:47Z","webTitle":"Staunch or stubborn?

Speaking to Guardian Australia last month, the Djab Wurrung, Gunnai and Gunditjmara woman would not say whether she would vote yes on the referendum, based on the proposed draft wording of the question. The sticking point is, as it always has been in Thorpe’s long opposition to the idea of an Indigenous voice to parliament, the question of sovereignty. And like most of Thorpe’s politics, it both predates and has been unchanged by her time in state and federal parliament. It has been shouted at the frontlines of protests and on police barricades for decades: stop black deaths in custody, stop removing Aboriginal children from their families, land rights, treaty. That constancy is, depending on whom you talk to, either Thorpe’s greatest strength or weakness. She is either stubborn or staunch; obstinate or uncompromising. The referendum campaign has sharpened focus on the Victorian senator, who is the First Nations spokesperson for the Australian Greens. But anyone waiting for Thorpe to fall into line is bound to be disappointed. ‘Tinkering around the edges’ Thorpe was one of seven delegates who walked out of the Uluru convention in 2017, the forum that resulted in the drafting of the Uluru statement from the heart, over the issue of sovereignty. They held that forming a voice to parliament under the Australian constitution would be seen as ceding sovereignty – a thing that, all 250 delegates agreed, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had never done. At the time, Thorpe was the cochair of the Victorian Naidoc committee. She has been involved in Aboriginal politics since birth: her grandmother, Alma Thorpe, helped found the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service in Fitzroy in 1973. Her mother, Marjorie Thorpe, was a commissioner of the stolen generations inquiry that produced the Bringing Them Home report. Her first job was working for her uncle Robbie Thorpe, who ran the Koori Information Centre in Fitzroy. Sovereignty is not, for First Nations peoples, a trivial point. And the draft referendum question, outlined by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, at the Garma festival, which states that parliament shall have power over the voice, has brought it to the fore. “The parliament is supreme over an Indigenous voice,” Thorpe says. “And I think that’s the crux of it right there. We want a treaty so that we can have real power.” Labor has, in order to reverse some of the damage done by the previous government’s bad faith reading of the Uluru statement, repeatedly stressed that the voice will be an advisory body only and one whose structure is under the parliament’s control. Those guarantees may have appeased non-Indigenous voters – and it is non-Indigenous voters who will decide the referendum – but it has not been met well by some First Nations voters. “What I’m hearing from Aboriginal people across the country is that they want more power; they’re sick of being an advisory body,” Thorpe says. “We’ve had hundreds of advisory bodies to government and they’ve not really done much at all … So if we’re talking about having power and influence in this country, we need to be talking about treaty.” The Uluru statement called for a treaty and a truth-telling process to occur alongside the referendum on the voice. Thorpe argues that those elements have been left behind, when they should be the main focus. “Treaty can give us so much more than a constitutionally enshrined voice that has parliamentary supremacy over it,” she says. “There is unfinished business in this country that needs to be reconciled and tinkering around the edges like an advisory body that the parliament chooses to take advice from or not – I don’t think that that goes far enough in terms of justice for our people in this country.” Thorpe’s criticism of the voice was known before she was preselected by the Greens for the Victorian state seat of Northcote in 2017 and again to fill the Senate vacancy left by Richard Di Natale in 2020. Just last month, she referred to the referendum as a “complete waste” of money. She softened some of her criticisms of the referendum this week after describing as “false and misleading” a report in the Australian that suggested she had met with Warren Mundine about their joint opposition to the voice. She has made a complaint about the report to the Press Council. (The Australian did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment about the story.) On Wednesday, the South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: “My colleagues are going to be supporting the yes campaign.” However, Thorpe’s critics are not confident that her negotiations with the government on the referendum will be genuine. In that September conversation, Thorpe told Guardian Australia that she could make compromises out of pragmatism – then named the 2018 treaty advancement legislation in Victoria as “an example of how I can compromise even though it’s not that great”. “It came down to the Greens to pass that legislation,” she says, “and we had 500 eagles poisoned on my country the night before that decision was made. That was a sign from my ancestors to say: don’t. Don’t pass it. Don’t pass it. It’s not good enough … and then the next day, I went in and supported it and felt like shit. Knowing that I supported something that is half-baked.” Asked if that was the lesson that was in her head as she thought about the referendum process, Thorpe says: “Possibly, yes.” Thorpe’s criticism of the Victorian treaty process has led to significant divisions with a number of highly respected members of the state’s Aboriginal community. That culminated last June in a dispute with the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria co-chair Geraldine Atkinson, which resulted in the latter making a formal complaint to the Greens leader, Adam Bandt. Thorpe’s former chief of staff reportedly sent an email to Atkinson apologising for the senator’s “appalling conduct”. Bandt’s office says he wrote to Atkinson last month, acknowledging that he should have replied to the letter she wrote to him in June 2021 and that “he took the actions that she had requested of him at the time”. He said it would be inappropriate to comment further. Thorpe tells Guardian Australia that “robust conversations and negotiations” were a feature of politics. “I’m not sure why that person felt aggrieved but that happens all the time in parliament,” she says. An Aboriginal Victorian, one of a number of critics of Thorpe who declined to speak on the record, said that since the incident with Atkinson, First Nations people were reluctant to publicly criticise the senator for fear of a backlash from within their own community. Thorpe says she is not concerned that other First Nations people may be wary of criticising her. “I’ve been given the mandate by my people to do what I do and say what I say,” she says. Atkinson was approached for comment. It is not the only damaging misstep of the past 12 months. In December, Thorpe publicly apologised to Liberal Hollie Hughes after she was accused of saying “at least I keep my legs shut” during a Senate debate. She later wrote an open letter to Greens supporters to apologise to them for the remark, saying: “I must be part of the solution in the fight to change the culture in Parliament House.” Unmitigated blackness Aboriginal activist and Victoria University history professor Gary Foley says that criticism from conservative commentators is an indication that Thorpe is doing a good job. “I think she’s brilliant,” he says. “I think she’s doing all the things that her constituency – and when I say her constituency, I’m not talking about the Greens, I’m talking about the Aboriginal people of Victoria – she’s doing what they want her to do.” Prof Chelsea Watego says Thorpe represents a kind of “unmitigated blackness” not often seen in Australian institutions. “Oftentimes in order to get entry into these particular places, these positions of power, one has to present as palatable, as conservative, as non-threatening, as moderate,” Watego says. “And she hasn’t done that, yet she is there.” Watego, a Munanjahli and South Sea Islander woman, is a professor of Indigenous health at the Queensland University of Technology. She is part of Thorpe’s second constituency: not a Victorian but a First Nations person who has not felt represented in parliament before. “She may be a member of a political party but it’s clear whose side she is on when it comes to issues facing our mob,” Watego says. Watego says this uncompromising presentation has made Thorpe a source of strength for her and other First Nations people, particularly First Nations women. Strength has also been drawn from moments that have been heavily criticised by sections of the mainstream media, to the point of calling Thorpe not fit to be in parliament, but widely circulated and celebrated on social media. Moments like referring to Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser when making her oath of office in August; arguing that the federal government’s $20m copyright acquisition of the Aboriginal flag meant the symbol had been “colonised by the Australian government”; and calling for a republic following the Queen’s death. But it would not matter, says Watego, if Thorpe changed her manner and stopped protesting. “Even if she was to be moderate, even if she was to adapt and change, she would still be despised by settlers,” Watego says. “There would still be people indignant that she dare occupy that space as a black woman.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-26T15:53:35Z","webTitle":"Time running out to reach Iran nuclear deal, warn experts ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","fields":{"bodyText":"Leading former diplomats including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers have warned the Iran nuclear talks are heading to “corrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension” and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Year-long talks in Vienna on reviving the deal and for the US, which was pulled out of the agreement by Donald Trump, to lift sanctions on Iran have in effect ground to a halt in a dispute over whether the west will lift the foreign terrorist organisation designation, and sanctions, against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The former diplomats said in an open letter that a final draft text of a renewed agreement was ready to be signed and warned that “for US and European leaders to let slip the opportunity to defuse a nuclear crisis in the Middle East would be a grave mistake”. Washington says the sanctions on the IRGC do not relate to the nuclear deal, but to its long-term terrorist behaviour in the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The signatories to the open letter, coordinated the European Leadership Network, include former senior diplomats in 14 countries including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former defence secretaries Lord King and Des Browne, as well as the former Conservative Middle East minister Alistair Burt. They say the legacy of Trump’s strategic error in leaving the agreement “can today be measured in the tons of enriched uranium Iran has since accumulated, including uranium enriched to near-weapons grade; in the thousands of advanced centrifuges it is spinning; and, in the rapidly dwindling timeframe for Iran to reach a breakout capability”. The US left the nuclear deal in 2018. Joe Biden on his election as president said he wanted to rejoin so long as Iran came back into compliance with the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. One proposal that Israel fears the US administration will adopt is to retain sanctions on the elite foreign arm of the IRGC, the al-Quds force, but lift the designation on the IRGC domestically. The letter’s authors acknowledge the politics of the foreign terrorist organisation designation are difficult but insist “there are ways to provide the counter-terrorism benefits of the current designation while still accommodating Iran’s specific request, and consider it imperative that these be fully explored”. “For its part, Iran should not expect a nuclear deal to address broader areas of disagreement between Tehran and Washington. Both sides must approach this final phase of negotiation with an understanding that the strategic implications of failure would be grave and profound.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 299 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-299-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has travelled to Belarus to meet the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as fears grow in Kyiv that Moscow is pushing its closest ally to join a new ground offensive against Ukraine. In the runup to the meeting, which will be Putin’s first visit to Belarus since 2019, Lukashenko said the two leaders would discuss the “military-political situation” in the region as well as economic cooperation. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk earlier on Monday ahead of Putin’s visit. The foreign ministers discussed “specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms”, Belarusian state media cited Belarus’ foreign ministry as saying, as well as having “touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects”. Belarus’ defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces’ military preparedness, hours ahead of Putin’s visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again. Ukraine’s forces are holding on to the heavily contested eastern city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Kyiv was ready for “all possible defence scenarios” against Moscow and its ally. “The Bakhmut direction is key,” he said in his latest national address. “We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there.” A Russian drone attack caused “fairly serious” damage in Kyiv region on Monday and three areas in the region have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 “kamikaze” drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow’s third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency has accused Russia of flouting nuclear safety by sending a “kamikaze” drone over part of a nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region just after midnight on Sunday. Energoatom said the Iranian-made Shahed drone had been detected over the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, and called on the international nuclear community to protect atomic sites from the risks of war. Air raid alerts were issued across Kyiv and most of Ukraine on Monday early afternoon, officials said. There were no immediate reports of attacks and the alarm was ended about 20 minutes later. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency has reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the region’s governor said. The UK is set to announce a major new artillery package for Ukraine as British prime minister Rishi Sunak prepares to meet with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch counterparts in Riga, Latvia, on Monday. Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on “degrading Russia’s capability to regroup and to resupply”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/15/cheerfulness-by-timothy-hampton-review-the-power-of-pep","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-15T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Cheerfulness by Timothy Hampton review – the power of pep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/15/cheerfulness-by-timothy-hampton-review-the-power-of-pep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/15/cheerfulness-by-timothy-hampton-review-the-power-of-pep","fields":{"bodyText":"The BBC’s wartime radio comedy It’s That Man Again – or ITMA – kept British peckers up during the blitz. It was a morale-boosting cavalcade of wacky characters, cheeky catchphrases and proto-Goon sound effects, in which depressed charlady Mona Lott, played by Joan Harben, would drone the latest awful thing that had happened to her and then hit you with the devastatingly deadpan punchline: “It’s being so cheerful that keeps me going.” ITMA is not mentioned in this intriguing and amusing history of cheerfulness by the American cultural historian Timothy Hampton, although Mona could be regarded as the standard-bearer for postwar intellectual respectability, as educated people increasingly assumed that being cheerful was shallow. Samuel Beckett famously responded to someone asking if the lovely weather didn’t make him glad to be alive: “I wouldn’t go as far as that” – and of course there is Philip Larkin, who said that deprivation was for him “what daffodils were to Wordsworth”. Cheerfulness is this book’s unashamed subject: not joy, not passion, not euphoria, but ordinary common-or-garden cheerfulness, the cheerfulness that Hampton records was specifically demanded of Boy Scouts in their Handbook of 1911; the scout “must never go about with a sulky air. He must always be bright and smiling … ” Could there be a more unfashionable idea in 2022, when young people who open up about feeling terrible are praised for their courage? Isn’t cheerfulness delusional, damaging and emotionally illiterate? Maybe not. In his genial and scholarly guide, Hampton takes us through the evolution of cheerfulness from the Middle Ages to the present. It was the concept that in 1941 gave the US its much-loved breakfast cereal, Cheerios, which were originally called Cheerioats. But the new name included the briskly pleasant “oh!” in its final syllable, calling us to join a community of happily contented consumers, just as, he writes, “Saint Paul had pointed to cheerfulness as the mediating affect that defines our relationship to the mystical body of Christ in the community of the new church”. Like Michel Foucault discussing the history of sexuality, Hampton proposes a history of cheerfulness that is not about the sunny character trait of the individual, which it’s possible to find enviable or annoying, but the unexamined social and cultural practice. It is a learned discipline, to be taken perfectly seriously as something that promotes social cohesiveness and personal humility. He finds Friedrich Nietzsche to be a key figure in the history of modern cheerfulness. While not obviously Mr Cheerful, the philosopher was someone who rejected the idea of it as mere placid wellbeing. In The Genealogy of Morals, he praises the “boldness” of “noble races … their hair-raising cheerfulness and profound joy in all destruction”. Well, perhaps here we are simply replacing what we think of as cheerfulness with more intense emotions, but Hampton nonetheless finds in Nietzsche’s ideas an important link with gaiety as a life-force, an apparently trivial but in fact vital component of what drives us to create and to achieve, and also to live fully and responsibly in maintaining the happiness of others. The English word “cheer”, says Hampton, comes from the Old French “chiere”, meaning face, and cheerfulness is about putting a brave face on things: again, it seems like an imposture, and yet looked at in another way, it is about a community spirit, or a kind of moral hospitality, a rejection of self-indulgence and a prioritising of the general mood. John Donne said that “God loves a cheerful giver” but Montaigne took the idea in another direction, emphasising cheerfulness, or gaiety, as something that liberated the self, a kind of spirited assertion that brings cheerfulness closer to that ferocity that Nietzsche praised. Cheerfulness is a perennially uncool value, something to be satirised as a symptom of sinister unexpressed anger. And yet in the real world it is part of that unassuming habit of politeness without which social interaction is impossible. Cheerfulness is never saying die, a key component of Dickens and also, I would say, (though he isn’t mentioned here) John Updike. It may never be considered important, but reading about it here has a weirdly cheering effect. Cheerfulness - A Literary and Cultural History by Timothy Hampton (Zone Books, £22).

But as he walked on to the stage to the lyrics “bring it back”, it became clear it was a nod to Labor’s commitment to bring back the State Electricity Commission (SEC) if elected on 26 November. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The commitment was central to the launch, with members of the Electrical Trades Union arriving at Cranbourne Community Theatre in T-shirts featuring the SEC’s old sun-ray logo. The deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, dedicated her entire speech to it. Allan told the crowd her father began his 50-year career in the electricity sector with an apprenticeship with the SEC, which at the time was Victoria’s sole provider of electricity generation, transmission and networks. “For a young person back then, working for the SEC meant a job for life. Secure, stable work, the kind of work you could raise a family on, build a life with,” she said. “Back then, each community and country town had its own SEC depot, each local depot employed its own local workers and each year a couple of extra apprentices would be taken on.” Allan went on to criticise its privatisation by the former Kennett Liberal government in the 1990s, a decision she said had failed workers and country communities and driven up power bills for Victorians. The latest federal budget predicted electricity prices were expected to rise by 56% over the next two years and gas prices by 40%. Labor also announced another power-saving bonus of $250 for households who seek a better power deal via a government website. The other new announcement was a $207m package for specialist schools. But the SEC dominated Andrews speech, with the premier describing its revival as “an opportunity for generations of Victorians” – 6,000 jobs for the commission will be dedicated to apprentices and local content requirements would guarantee them a pipeline of work – while framing the election as a choice between privatisation and public ownership. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, on Sunday mocked the government’s SEC commitment as taking Victoria “back to 1975” with “no evidence it will actually lower energy bills”. Strategists, however, have said the policy is getting the most cut-through of all of Labor’s election commitments so far. It appeals to older voters, who remember the simpler times that Allan revisited in her speech, and younger voters, who in an era of job instability and short-term employment contracts would find the possibility of working for one company for decades an attractive proposition. This was embodied in a slick campaign video produced for the launch, featuring “mates” Graham and Mick, who spoke of the “good old days” of the SEC – both worked more than 20 years for the commission before it was privatised – and then Damien, James and Shannon, who work in the industry now. “We go from one contract to another and it doesn’t really enable you to plan and be secure as far as your financial situation goes,” Damien says in the video. It also appeals to those who want a faster transition to renewables (read: voters who may be considering backing the Greens in Labor-held seats in the inner city) as well as workers, who are being told they won’t be left behind. Coalition focuses on Andrews government’s weaknesses The central theme at the Coalition’s launch was less clear. Guy spoke about rebuilding Victoria’s burdened healthcare system, easing cost-of-living pressures on families, the state’s growing debt and the integrity cloud over the government. Guests were handed “frequent-liar” cards, a nod to the several Ibac investigations that have played out during Andrews’ time as premier. But outside, a small group of protesters in lobster suits sought to remind voters the Coalition also hasn’t covered itself in glory on the issue of integrity – referring to 2017 revelation Guy dined at Beaumaris Lobstercave with an alleged mafia boss. Guy announced the Coalition would cover electricity supply charges on power bills for the first six months of 2023, saving households an estimated $235, and promised that all new gas produced in Victoria would be quarantined for Victorian use. But his focus was on the government weaknesses and the challenge ahead. To win outright, the Coalition needs a net gain of 18 seats. Adding to its woes, it will enter the race in a worse position than it was then, thanks to an electoral redistribution that sees Labor gain two net seats, based on the 2018 vote. “It’s like climbing Mount Everest without oxygen and here in Victoria, Labor have been in government for 19 of the past 23 years, it’s like doing it all in a blizzard – all backwards,” Guy said. “But for the sake of all those people impacted by Daniel Andrews and his world-record lockdowns, we must win this election.” Guy said there was a “growing wave of anger and resentment” against the premier in the state that makes him “more and more confident” that the Coalition will win the election. He has two more weeks to make his case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T18:09:57Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s political cowardice applies the brake to cheap energy as he bets nuclear | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","fields":{"bodyText":"The two main criticisms of the government’s new energy security strategy are fair. The tiptoeing around onshore wind, which got gentle words of encouragement but no change to planning regulations, looks a case of political cowardice. It is perverse to apply a handbrake to “one of the cheapest forms of renewable power”, to use the government’s own description, when public opinion is broadly supportive of turbines on land. Objections from Tory backbenchers should have been ignored. Equally, the lack of new measures on energy efficiency is bizarre since every serious body, from the International Energy Agency to our own National Infrastructure Commission, has been banging the drum for ages. “A gradual transition following the grain of behaviour” translates as a win for the cold hand of the Treasury. There were two clear positives in the mix, it should be said. First, the target for more offshore wind is genuinely ambitious. A fivefold increase in capacity to 50 gigawatts by the end of the decade is a significant upgrade on the previous aim of 40GW. The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress. And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore. Second, solar was given a boost with the aim (though not a target, note) to increase capacity fivefold by 2035. It is illogical that the government seems more willing to flex planning rules for solar than for wind, but solar is the quiet success story of the renewables revolution. It has outpaced every cost projection over the past decade. Expansion looks the easiest to deliver. Then, though, one comes to the meat of the plan. The big bet on nuclear is, to put it mildly, hopeful. The government is trying to replace current capacity that will largely go offline by 2050 and also double nuclear’s share of electricity supply versus today’s position. The plan strains credibility. Up to eight new reactors – call it four new two-reactor plants the size of Hinkley Point C – is an enormous undertaking. The best that can be said is that it is possible to imagine how events could, possibly, run favourably. Hinkley could arrive within its revised timetable without further cost hiccups. Sizewell C in Suffolk, the next plant on the block, could attract the desired rush of private-sector investors under a new financing model that would allow the juice to be priced within the £60-£70 a megawatt hour range of political acceptability. And success in financing Sizewell could breed confidence and get the show rolling. There are, though, a lot of assumptions in that list. The biggest unknown is whether the government is prepared to back the EPR design – the one used at Hinkley and set for Sizewell – for all the new plants. Logic says it should because mixing and matching designs is a recipe for higher costs and surprises, a point stressed by the energy analyst Peter Atherton. The productivity gain in constructing Hinkley’s second reactor, for example, is said to be 15%. In a complex process, replicating one design has demonstrable value. The government is not, though, at the stage where it can have sufficient confidence to back EPRs wholeheartedly and mean it. Talk of “leading the world” in nuclear construction should therefore be filed under “believe it when you see it”. You have to know what you plan to build to make such boasts. There is an alarming nuclear-sized question mark at the heart of this strategy. Shareholders push supermarkets towards living wage See, resolutions from agitating shareholders can make a difference. Well, the tale of two pay rises for frontline staff in the supermarket sector cannot be attributed directly to the resolution filed at Sainsbury’s by the campaign group Share Action with backing from Legal &amp; General among others. But it probably helped to concentrate minds in the boardroom. Tesco is raising its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from late-July. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is expected to lift the rate for staff in outer London from £10.50 an hour to £11.05, meaning those workers will join colleagues in the rest of the country in getting the real living wage at a minimum. The shareholder resolution called on Sainsbury’s (and, by extension, its main competitors) to get itself accredited as a real living wage employer, which would require it go further. The commitment has to be permanent and third-party contractors such as cleaners and security guards have to be included. But perhaps the pace is quickening. It should. Large supermarket chains should be able to meet accepted definitions of living wages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T18:04:31Z","webTitle":"Putin suggests possibility of settlement to end war in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. “The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground,” the Russia president said during remarks at a press-conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The remarks came just days after Putin appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Initially, Russian commanders expected the war would last just a matter of weeks before a Russian victory, according to plans captured at the beginning of the war. It is now in its 10th month and Russia has been forced to retreat for several months. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Putin claimed that his military operation was going to plan. “Everything is stable. There are no questions or problems there,” he said, adding that information was being given to the public transparently. Those remarks came a day after Putin appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Speaking after an awards ceremony for “Heroes of Russia” at the Kremlin on Thursday, the president addressed a group of soldiers. Acknowledging the targeted attacks by Russia, Putin blamed Ukraine for initiating a trend of attacking civilian infrastructure, pointing to a blast on a key bridge between the Russian mainland and the annexed Crimean peninsula. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said, of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it? There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. This will not interfere with our combat missions.” The video, taken by the Russian state-owned TV channel Zvezda, shows Putin holding a glass while speaking about the fates of tens of millions of Ukrainians. Ukraine has previously rejected Moscow’s claims that the strikes on its energy facilities were a retaliation for the Kerch bridge attack. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency has claimed Russian military units had received instructions from the Kremlin to prepare massive missile strikes a week before the Crimean Bridge attack. Throughout the war, journalists, independent organisations and Ukrainian officials have also documented Russian attacks on civilian buildings and infrastructure. Putin went on to accuse Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and for not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said, blaming the west for “complete silence” on these claims and of bias against Russia. The Ukrainian prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said last month that Russia’s attacks on the Ukrainian energy grid were an act of genocide. In April, Unicef found that at least 35 water engineers had been killed or injured in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts since 2014, when clashes broke out between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine. Some villages have been without water since then. Putin’s shelling of critical infrastructure across Ukraine has left millions without water, heating, gas and light as winter sets in. Russian forces shelled the entire frontline in the Donetsk oblast in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. “The Russians have intensified their efforts in Donetsk and Luhansk,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a video post on Thursday. “They are now in a very active phase of attempting to conduct offensive operations. We are advancing nowhere but, rather, defending, destroying the enemy’s infantry and equipment wherever it tries to advance.” The Ukrainian energy operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday that it was still reeling from the latest bout of strikes this week and was at a “significant deficit”. On Friday, Putin said after the exchange of the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout for the US basketball player Brittney Griner that more exchanges might be possible. “Are any other exchanges possible? Everything is possible,” he said. The former marine Paul Whelan, who was arrested in Russia and sentenced to 16 years for espionage, was not included in this week’s trade. He said that the trade was organised by the Russian FSB security agency and that US and Russian spy agencies only discussed the prisoner swap. “It wasn’t our goal to move from these talks to any others. But of course, they create a certain atmosphere, it’s true,” he said. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable.” “However, nothing will remain of the enemy,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/14/classical-music-bbc-orchestras-singers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"There is no one with power to fight for classical music at the BBC now.

They are celebrated worldwide for unparalleled versatility, flexibility and ability to respond to an ever-changing landscape and the demands of (in my time) six director generals, each keen to leave their mark. Delivering quality first and value for money was the mantra, and meeting the challenge of reaching new and diverse audiences was the reward. Or so we thought. The BBC announced last week that its great cultural assets are to be savaged so violently that they may never recover; that is the reward. The corporation runs one full-time professional chamber choir, three full-time orchestras in England, and one each in Wales and Scotland. The plan is to axe the BBC Singers before the Proms, on the eve of their centenary, to reduce the headcount by 20% of the three English orchestras, while Simon Webb, the newly appointed fall guy is working with the nations’ orchestras “to consider whether there could be any lessons” for them. A dark warning indeed. How has this been allowed to happen? Early last year, the BBC’s music review recommended an extraordinary restructure. Alan Davey, the recently departed controller of BBC Radio 3 and the Proms, ceased to have direct responsibility for the classical ensembles that are now under the control of former head of rock and pop Lorna Clarke, while Webb, the former director of the BBC Philharmonic, is the new head of orchestras and choirs in England. The BBC’s timing is as calculated as its strategy is callous: ensembles struggling to recover from the pandemic, exhausted from keeping the show on the road throughout, three of the ensembles without a permanent director and all contractually gagged. There is not one single champion for classical music left at the BBC in any position of power or influence. Herod has been left minding the creche. The rhetoric wrapped around the plan is as predictable and flimsy as it is insulting to the licence-fee payer, the UK’s music lovers and all BBC musicians. “Bold. Ambitious. Good for the audiences who love classical music. Ensuring every pound of the licence fee works harder for the sector and for our audiences.” And so it goes on. We’ve heard it before. What does it mean? Imagine having a garage with five high-performance sports cars, and deciding to save money by removing a wheel from each one and using the spare when you decide to race one. Oh, and that’s when you’ve already shot the only champion racehorse you had in the stable. It takes years to train musicians and forge an orchestra or choir to operate at the highest level on a world stage; that almost telepathic connection that thrills an audience can only be achieved from musicians who work together day in day out. After the long dark months of Covid, when the world wondered whether live music would ever be heard again, it was the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra that came together in an empty Royal Albert Hall for the first night of the 2020 Proms to give performances of such profound emotional depth of the sort that only those musicians could, working in such alien conditions. How proud the BBC was of them then and how grateful music lovers everywhere. Why does this matter? Because reductions in the BBC’s commitment to classical music will shrink the sector and offer increasingly less value to audiences. It’s all very well to speak of music education, but for what? If there are no beacons of excellence to aspire to, and inspire, no opportunities for young musicians to experience live music, for composers to find their voice, for conductors to practise their craft, and for audiences to be engaged and enthralled, isn’t that hypocritical? Because that is the trajectory of classical music in this country. If we don’t wake up soon, there will be no live classical music. Whether you engage with it or not, its right to exist needs protecting. When I joined the BBC in 1999, I understood the role of public service broadcasting, which, in turn, defined the role of the orchestras and choirs. To serve our audiences with great and familiar music, to share the less well-known and neglected repertoire, to introduce new talent and to bring to the UK important new works from around the world. I think back to UK premieres of John Adams’ operas The Death of Klinghoffer and Doctor Atomic, or Jake Heggie’s searing Dead Man Walking, all dealing with controversial issues relevant to our time. Every time I read or heard “only the BBC could do that”, I felt so proud, and how often were we and our work championed by the BBC every time the charter review came around or the big cheeses were entertaining at the Proms. I no longer know if the BBC is a public service broadcaster; I don’t recognise it any more, or its values. If it no longer exists to do that which others cannot or will not, then what is it for? After 23 years of constant change, the ensembles of the BBC have never been more agile, flexible or willing to adapt, and they represent tremendous value for money in the grand scheme of the BBC’s budget and our licence-fee payment. The role of cultural patron is not optional, and the responsibilities as custodian of music ensembles do not give the BBC permission to dispose of and dismantle them without serious public discussion, not to mention honest, transparent internal debate. The values and behaviour of what we are told repeatedly is “our BBC” must matter to all of us as much as the content.

Pahlavi said there were signs that if the west imposed maximum pressure, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and some reformist politicians would desert the regime. Exiled since he was 17 and sometimes described as the “crown prince”, Pahlavi has joined forces with high-profile young activists inside and outside Iran to forge an alliance. They are trying to draw up a charter based on a set of secular democratic principles, which a constituent assembly would use as the basis of a constitution to be put to a referendum. The charter was due to have been published at the end of February but was temporarily delayed to allow for the consultation of Kurdish groups. Pahlavi, who is on a European tour, has two key demands of the west: to help Iranians avoid the regime’s suppression of the internet, and to proscribe, rather than just impose sanctions on, the IRGC. He said: “The reason the revolution is continuing is because everybody understands this is do-or-die. Iranians are calling for ‘death to the dictator’. They are getting shot in the eyes and, if not, imprisoned or tortured or executed, and they are still standing there. The world needs to respond and be on their side.” So far, the campaign, which was given a platform at the Munich security conference instead of the Iranian foreign ministry, has been unable to persuade either the EU or the UK to proscribe the IRGC. The suspicion is that diplomats fear proscription would kill the small chance of reviving the Iran nuclear deal. The CIA director, William Burns, said on Sunday that Iran was nearing the uranium-enrichment level of a nuclear state, but had not resumed weaponisation. Pahlavi said: “Political expediency often has a problem with freedom-loving movements. The fact some governments are suggesting the protests are tapering off is perhaps because they want to justify some re-engagement and negotiations. It’s a bit like South Africa at the end of apartheid. Governments tried to ignore the issue until it was impossible to do so.” In parallel with supporting labour strikes in Iran, he said proscription of the IRGC would cripple its operations worldwide. He said the IRGC, as distinct from the regular army, “is an armed paramilitary mafia that controls every aspect of the country, but only the top echelons of the IRGC benefit from this. The lower ranks have to decide if they want to be used as an instrument of repression, or to consider this regime is on its last legs and they should take the exit strategy being offered to them, through truth and reconciliation, and return to the bosom of the nation. In my vision of regime change, the lower paramilitary ranks peel away from the regime, but that requires maximum pressure by the west.” He said there were signs that some reformist politicians – those he said were in the “grey zone” – such as Mir Hosssein Mousavi, the former prime minister, were realising the regime was not capable of reform. “The discourse of the reformists is increasingly: ‘Forget about reform. It is not going to work, and we need to think past this regime.’ There is a convergence with what we are saying.” Pahlavi denied his presence in the new opposition alliance harked back to the past, or made the movement ideologically incoherent. “I am not here to be president or the next monarch. I am here to use my political capital and the trust that people have in me to be instrumental in helping the transition process. My only mission in life is to see the day the Iranians go to the polls and decide their own fate.” But, he added: “If afterwards I can contribute by helping to institutionalise checks on concentration of power, or corruption, or abuse of power or a new political culture… that is where I think I can be most effective”. He said some saw value in the institution of the monarchy, as a force bringing the country together. “I want to be a neutral element. I am neither in the camp of the monarchists or republicans.” As to the record of his father, who was accused of human rights abuses and corruption, he said: “I am my own person with my own thoughts.” But nor did he disown his father’s rule, brought to an end by the 1979 revolution. “Obviously there were some mistakes made. Nobody denies that. But net, if you look at the balance, most people say the country was moving forward. Iran was prospering. Had it not been for this revolution, we should at least have been South Korea. Instead, we are North Korea.” He said he did not condone torture, and denied it was ever state policy. “People do not look at me as going back to the past. They look at me and see someone moving towards a future.” He dismissed suggestions the current campaign had no purchase inside Iran, and was just a motley collection of diaspora activists. “It originates from inside Iran, and that is why it has legitimacy. This is not something we concocted to export to Iran. Quite the opposite. We are the voice of those inside Iran that cannot openly advocate for obvious reasons. It is a diverse group: left, right, centre, republicans and monarchists.” He said he welcomed other political charters being floated, as they had been in recent days, and said his alliance’s proposal would be worthless if it did not have signoff from within Iran. “In terms of time, we do not have a gun to our head. If people need time to consult, so be it.” He argued the revival of the nuclear deal – the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA) – would only benefit China, not the west. “It is curious to me that the Biden administration is so hell-bent on rejuvenating a JCPoA, when first time round the west did not benefit economically. As long as this regime is in power there will be a complete block on cooperating with the west. That is the mindset.” But that does not lead Pahlavi to support a military attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, which Israel favours. He said he understood Israel felt it faced an existential threat, but “we cannot jump from failed diplomacy to military confrontation. There is a third way, and that is to give that extra push to the people in the streets to help end this regime. It would be historically criminal not to give that process a chance before you resort to other options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T14:46:55Z","webTitle":"Pakistan internet cut as violence erupts after arrest of ex-PM Imran Khan ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad","fields":{"bodyText":"Internet services have been suspended across Pakistan after violence erupted when the former prime minister, Imran Khan, was arrested at a court appearance in Islamabad and dragged into an armoured vehicle by scores of security forces in riot gear. The arrest of Khan – who was ousted from power last year and has evaded arrest several times since – came hours after he released a video message reiterating his allegations that Pakistan’s powerful military establishment had tried to assassinate him twice. Khan’s arrest is the latest twist in a political and economic crisis that pits the popular former prime minister against the military and the government, led by his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, who Khan alleges conspired to remove him from power and make threats on his life, charges they deny. Hours after his arrest, protests began to erupt across Pakistan, with the army accused of orchestrating his detention. More than 40 people were arrested and officials said one protester had been killed after they were shot by an officer near a military checkpoint in the city of Quetta. In Karachi, a police vehicle was set on fire and in Lahore, supporters broke into the house of the military corps commander, smashing windows and setting furniture on fire, while shouting: “We warned you not to touch Imran Khan.” Mobile internet services were cut across the country, according to the Pakistan telecommunication authority, and access to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, where videos of the protests were being widely shared, was restricted. Late on Tuesday the UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office issued a new travel warning advising against travel to several regions of Pakistan, and saying that “further disruption should be expected.” Khan had travelled to Islamabad on Tuesday morning to seek bail in two corruption cases, some of dozens involving corruption, sedition and terrorism that he is facing. As he entered the court premises, Khan was arrested by agents from the National Accountability Bureau, the country’s anti-corruption body, who were followed by a contingent of paramilitary officers. Khan was put into a vehicle with tinted windows and driven off under heavy security, while a scuffle broke out between his supporters and police. According to a statement released by Islamabad police, his detention was connected to a separate case, known as the Al-Qadir Trust case, which involves allegations Khan earned billions of rupees through illegal land transactions and where he had not been granted bail. It stated that Khan would be produced before the court on Wednesday. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) called his arrest a “black day for our democracy and country”. Fawad Chaudhry, a PTI spokesperson, alleged Khan had been “abducted from court premises, scores of lawyers and general people have been tortured, Imran Khan has been whisked away by unknown people to an unknown location”. In a video posted to PTI’s official Twitter account, the barrister Gohar Khan alleged Khan had been struck on the head and the legs by paramilitary officers who entered the premises of the Islamabad high court to arrest him. The interior minister, Rana Sanaullah, said Khan’s arrest was because of his failure to turn up to hearings in a corruption case and denied all allegations of torture. “The arrest has been conducted by the National Accountability Bureau for causing losses to the national treasury,” he said. After Khan’s arrest, the chief justice of Islamabad, Justice Aamer Farooq, demanded an explanation “within 15 minutes” from the police chief and the interior ministry secretary as to why Khan had been detained. “Come to court and tell us why Imran has been arrested and in which case,” he said. Farooq said that if they did not appear, he would summon both Khan and the prime minister, Sharif. The arrest warrant for Khan was released soon after, dated 1 May, stating he was accused of “corruption and corrupt practices”. On Tuesday night, the Islamabad high court ruled that the arrest was legal and that Khan had ignored several notices to appear in court. Insp Gen Akbar Nasir Khan, of Islamabad police, urged calm and said the situation in Islamabad was normal. However, in an attempt to prevent protest, a section 144 was imposed in the city to prevent gatherings of more than five people and internet was cut off in some areas. Since Khan fell from power in April last year in a vote of no confidence, he has been on a crusade against Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, and in particular the senior army generals who it is widely acknowledged helped bring him to power. But after the relationship disintegrated, they orchestrated his removal as prime minister. He accused the military and the Sharif government of a “western-backed conspiracy” to topple him and of being behind an attempt on his life in November last year, when a gunman opened fire during a rally in Punjab and Khan was shot in the leg. This week, the media wing of the armed forces issued another strongly worded rebuttal of Khan’s allegations. Yet during this time Khan’s popularity his soared, with many admiring his determination to go up against Pakistan’s military establishment, which has long been Pakistan’s political puppet master. There is widespread discontent with the Sharif government, as inflation and food shortages have rocketed, and it is expected that Khan could return to power in the next general election, due in October, if he is not disqualified from politics before then. Khan has been putting pressure on the Sharif government to call an early general election, claiming that the coalition that took power after he was removed is “illegitimate”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/oct/15/brainwashed-sex-camera-power-review-nina-menkes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T16:50:11Z","webTitle":"Brainwashed: Sex-Camera-Power review – a good hard look at the male gaze ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/15/brainwashed-sex-camera-power-review-nina-menkes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/oct/15/brainwashed-sex-camera-power-review-nina-menkes","fields":{"bodyText":"Film-maker and theorist Nina Menkes takes to the stage in this docu-essay slash movie lecture: a fierce and focused polemic reviving the subject of the “male gaze” for the #MeToo era. Starting with an interview with British critic Laura Mulvey (described by Menkes as the “original gangster” who invented the term), Menkes shows us that the way the camera looks at women, and everything else, is not a transparent, value-free business. On the contrary: with men so overwhelmingly in charge, it is an activity of coercion and imposition, determined by gender politics. And sexuality as it appears on screen is not the natural, unmediated free expression of equal pleasure, but deeply embedded in male power relations. One movie clip Menkes could have cited but doesn’t is from This Is Spinal Tap: bassist Nigel Tufnell being told their album cover is sexist and replying: “What’s wrong with being sexy?” The gap between sexy and sexist is where much of the discourse happens. Menkes goes on to take these concepts out of the movie screen and the seminar room, and into the commercial world: the male gaze has its corollaries in the film industry’s sexist hiring practices and its tolerance of sexual harassment and assault – an iceberg of which Harvey Weinstein was the nauseous tip. The way this works is broken down by Menkes: women are endowed with desirability in the way shots are set up and framed and camera-movements choreographed, and the way that so often, particularly in the studio era, male faces are lit with the lived-in 3D cragginess of someone who doesn’t have to be attractive while female faces are lit with a flat 2D studio sheen making them inert, like models, very often not inhabiting the same space that the men appear to be inhabiting. (I admit it: I have watched the swimming pool scene in Scorsese’s Raging Bull dozens of times, yet only after watching Brainwashed have I appreciated the way that Cathy Moriarty’s image is detached from the male speakers.) It all happens within the duality of subject and object; male desirer (with whom the audience is often tacitly invited to make common cause) and the female desiree. This is the anode and cathode of the male gaze, the male gaze’s voltage and electromotive force. But how about female directors? Menkes makes an exception for the heroic standouts of golden age Hollywood such as Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino. But rightly or wrongly, she often implies that many women directors in modern times have gone along with the traditional male set-up and are sellouts, effectively pastiching the male gaze for a male industry. At one point, in a montage of films showing the camera leering malely at women’s buttocks, Menkes includes, without any discussion, a scene from Julia Ducournau’s Titane which shows the semi-unclothed heroine cavorting on a car for male onlookers. Plenty of critics believe that Titane – a Cannes Palme d’Or winner – is a triumphant example of progressive and sex-positive film-making. Menkes is evidently unconvinced (actually, so am I), but perhaps she could have made this explicit. Moreover, Menkes is uncharacteristically hesitant when, in a bracing spirit of openness, she cites a movie widely loathed for its racial attitudes: the lurid, pulpy slave drama Mandingo, from 1975, which contains a scene in which the white mistress forces the black slave to have sex with her. Menkes shows us how the camera salivates over the slave’s passive naked body in exactly the way it usually lingers over a woman’s body. But perhaps wary of appearing to endorse this approach, she calls the film “cringe-making”. So it is. But aren’t all these other male-gaze films cringe-making as well? Brainwashed is a bracing blast of critical rigour, taking a clear, cool look at the unexamined assumptions behind what we see on the screen. • Brainwashed: Sex-Camera-Power screened at the London film festival and is released on 12 May in UK cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss on collision course with Jacob Rees-Mogg over solar power ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","fields":{"bodyText":"Liz Truss is facing a rebellion from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business department over plans to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland. The prime minister and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, want to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land, the Guardian revealed earlier this week. But her business secretary, Rees-Mogg, is understood to believe it is “unconservative” to tell farmers what they can and cannot do with their land. Her climate minister, Graham Stuart, said on Wednesday he would be speaking to Defra about the plans as more ground-mount solar is needed to meet renewable energy targets. In a piece for the Guardian, Rees-Mogg, who has previously decried “climate alarmism”, insists he is convinced by the need to boost renewable energy. He also reveals new policies including loosening regulations for businesses to put solar power in place and giving homeowners grants to install panels on their houses. In the piece, he says he is “not a green energy sceptic”, adding that his department would give “unprecedented support” to renewable energy sources. Rees-Mogg also brands coalmines and oil rigs as “dark satanic mills”, vowing to replace them with windfarms. On solar, he adds: “We are exploring options to support low-cost finance to help householders with the upfront costs of solar installation, permitted development rights to support deployment of more small-scale solar in commercial settings and designing performance standards to further encourage renewables, including solar PV, in new homes and buildings.” Stuart told the environmental audit committee in parliament on Wednesday that his and Rees-Mogg’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy opposed the ban. He said his department would be speaking to Defra about its plans. “We’re going to work closely with Defra, and the British energy security strategy set out an expectation for a fivefold increase in solar,” he said. “It’s clear that we need significant growth in both ground-mount and rooftop solar to meet this ambition.” The rebellion comes after reports that Truss has berated her cabinet ministers for briefing against her more unpopular policies, including rumours she considered linking benefit rises to wages rather than inflation. Truss’s spokesperson confirmed on Monday that the plans to ban solar from agricultural land were going ahead. This is despite analysis in the Financial Times showing that in doing so, England would lose £20bn in investment, which critics said would harm her growth agenda. Asked about the Guardian’s report, Truss’s official spokesperson told journalists: “I can point you back to what the prime minister said, I think at the start of September, when she said she doesn’t think we should be putting solar panels on productive agricultural lands, because obviously as well as the energy security issue, we face a food security issue. So we need to strike the right balance.” The prime minister has always had a personal ambivalence towards ground-mount solar, falsely claiming when she was environment secretary that solar panels harmed food security. During her leadership campaign this summer, she dismissed panels as “paraphernalia”, adding: “On my watch, we will not lose swathes of our best farmland to solar farms.” Truss is understood to have the support of Jayawardena, who would have to submit the plans to change the farmland grading system to Rees-Mogg’s department and the department for levelling up in order for it to be approved. He has asked his officials to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b, on which most new solar projects are built. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. Rees-Mogg’s pro-renewable comments may come as a surprise to green campaigners, who have been alarmed by his previous remarks on climate. Last month, he told department staff that Britain “must get every cubic inch of gas out of the North Sea”, a leaked video shows. Critics at the time accused the business secretary of “putting his ideology before the climate” and “greenwashing fossil fuels” by prioritising gas over renewables. He has also been a keen advocate of fracking, with a leaked email showing he was trying to evade scrutiny of new energy projects, including those using the controversial method. Sources close to the business secretary later clarified that he wanted to be able to quickly build for all energy methods, including renewables and fracking. An email to officials, seen by the Guardian, set out that he had noted that parliamentary legislation was not subject to judicial review, and could potentially be used to speed along new projects. Rees-Mogg has also said he would be “delighted” to have fracking in his back garden, and has called those who oppose shale gas extraction “luddites” and “socialists”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T13:44:35Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 406 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw with military honours, tributes and praise from Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Poland will send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. France’s President Emmanuel Macron is in China with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Speaking to journalists, the French leader said anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. He added that it was not in China’s interest to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has attended a ceremony at the Kremlin where he met the new ambassadors to Moscow and accepted their diplomatic credentials. Among the 17 new ambassadors attending the ceremony on Wednesday was Lynne Tracy, the US’ new ambassador to Russia. Putin told Tracy in an address that US support for a revolution in Ukraine in 2014 had led to the current situation where Russia and Ukraine were in conflict. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has met Russian officials in Kaliningrad for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said Sweden needs to take further steps for Ankara to ratify its Nato membership bid. Çavuşoğlu also told reporters that he had discussed Sweden’s Nato bid and developments regarding Ankara’s purchase of F-16 fighter jets with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Washington unveiled $2.6bn more in military assistance for Zelenskiy’s government on Tuesday, including three air surveillance radars, anti-tank rockets and fuel trucks. Finland became the 31st member of Nato Tuesday after its foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, signed an accession document and handed it to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, at a ceremony in Brussels. Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, said the accession of Finland increased the risks of wider conflict. US president Joe Biden welcomed Finlands’ ascension and urged Turkey and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes for Sweden to join. Ukraine hopes to receive two more tranches worth $1.8bn from the International Monetary Fund this year under its newly approved four-year lending program, top Ukrainian central bank officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine this week received the first $2.7bn tranche under the program, which is a part of a bigger $115bn global package of support. Britain blocked the UN webcast of an informal Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, at which Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights is due to speak. The international criminal court wants to arrest the commissioner on war crimes charges. Such meetings are not held in the Security Council chamber and all 15 council members have to agree to allow it to be webcast by the United Nations. The US is trying to wreck Russia’s planned summit with African countries as part of efforts to isolate Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Moscow is preparing for its second summit with African countries, scheduled for the end of July in St Petersburg. A Ukrainian soldier pleaded “partly guilty” on Tuesday at Russia’s first trial for war crimes in connection with its military campaign in Ukraine.

Germany’s economic minister warned of “catastrophic” industrial shutdowns, fraying supply chains and mass unemployment. France’s president urged citizens to turn down the heating. Spain asked why countries that hadn’t got hooked on Russian gas should bail out neighbours who had lectured them about fiscal discipline in the past. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, gleefully predicted that Europeans would be “freezing in their homes” because they hadn’t thought through the consequences of throwing their support behind Ukraine. “The cold is coming soon,” he said, menacingly, in June last year. But as the European Union enters the last month of the meteorological winter in 2023, signs are becoming clearer that its members have weathered an historic crisis – and not just because “General Frost” has proved a milder adversary than Medvedev predicted. Within eight months of Russian troops setting foot on Ukrainian soil, the bloc of 27 European states replaced about 80% of the natural gas it used to draw through pipelines with Russia, by rapidly building up new infrastructure for liquid natural gas, finding creative ways to help each other out amid shortages, and successfully pursuing energy-saving policies. The Netherlands, for example, the EU’s largest natural gas producer, had relied on Russian gas for 15-20% of its supplies as it wound down its huge Groningen field, but doubled its LNG import capacity with storage and regasification units in Rotterdam and Eemshaven. It used the extra capacity to meet domestic demand – which it managed to reduce by 22% compared with previous years’ averages – and supply surplus gas to the Czech Republic, Germany and France. As elsewhere, consumer energy prices soared, but were subsidised and capped. “There was a point last autumn when I worried that some European governments would respond to the crisis by prioritising their own energy supplies and stop sharing with their neighbours, which would have been economically and politically devastating,” said Simone Tagliapietra, an energy expert at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel. “But Europe managed to avoid the temptation of protectionism and managed to keep its internal market intact.” Gas spot prices dropped to about €55 a megawatt hour (MWh) on Monday, a level last seen before the start of the war in September 2021, down from €330/MWh at the end of last August. Over the course of the whole of last year, gas demand in the European Union was 12% lower than the average from the period 2019 to 2021, Bruegel estimates. Germany, always destined to bear the brunt of Putin’s gas blackmail effort due to its high reliance on energy exports from Russia, managed to use 14% less gas in 2022 than it had done on average in the years from 2018 to 2021. It enters February with its gas storage tanks 80% full, compared with 36% at this point last year. Even though high gas prices have taken their toll on German industry, the damage has so far not been catastrophic. While GDP in Europe’s largest economy fell by 0.2% from October to December, the government last week improved its forecast for the coming year, predicting the recession to be “shorter and milder” than expected. The Nordic countries were even more successful at reducing gas consumption, with Denmark cutting total demand – for power generation, industry and domestic heating – by 24%, Sweden by 36% and Finland by a mighty 47% (although natural gas accounted for only 5% of its overall energy needs). Last summer, some southern European states had initially signalled reluctance to equally share the burden of energy saving. Spain agreed to a 7-8% reduction in gas use after arguing that the uniform 15% target was simply not fair on countries which, like itself, were not heavily dependent on Russian gas and that had “done our homework” when it came to diversifying energy supplies. Yet it didn’t shy from the task. In July, the socialist-led coalition government announced a series of measures intended to help reduce the country’s energy consumption and its use of Russian oil and gas. Many of the initiatives were based on thrift and common sense. The measures, which will remain in place until this November, set strict limits on air conditioning and heating temperatures in public and large commercial buildings. Under the decree, heating in shopping centres, cinemas, theatres, rail stations and airports should not be set above 19C in winter and air conditioning should not be set below 27C in summer. As a result, Spain ended up meeting the very target to which it had been reluctant to commit: between August and November, the country reduced its demand for natural gas by 15% compared with the level of consumption for the same period in the last five years. In France, the energy-saving effort became an uphill struggle because several key French nuclear reactors were undergoing maintenance or safety work just as they were needed more than ever. From the start of May to the end of October, about half of France’s 56 reactors sat idle due to repair works, turning the country from Europe’s biggest electricity exporter into a net importer. One of the countries upping its electricity exports to France in that period was Germany, which in turn imported more gas from its western neighbour. After French local officials had prepared contingency plans for the worst-case scenario of power cuts in December, the situation has stabilised. By mid-January, 73% of France’s nuclear fleet was back in operation, helping it to regain its spot as the EU’s top exporter of electricity. When nuclear plants struggled, renewables came to the rescue. According to an analysis by thinktank Ember Climate, the European Union in 2022 drew 22% of its electricity from solar and wind power, with renewables surpassing gas for the first time. Remarkably, Sweden, with an energy mix long-dominated by nuclear and hydropower, became Europe’s largest power exporter in 2022, selling 20% of its output abroad – in part thanks to the rapid growth of onshore wind. Wind is now Sweden’s third-largest source of electricity and scheduled to expand further. Finland’s wind power capacity increased by 75% last year alone, allowing the country to increase energy self-sufficiency “at a really good pace”, officials said. Plans to expand renewable energy production have, in fact, been radically accelerated by the energy crisis in all three Nordic countries, with onshore wind and solar power now forecast to more than double by 2030 and wind the dominant energy source. Ultimately, Vladimir Putin’s energy war decision will have helped put Sweden on track to produce 65% of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade, Finland 51%, and Denmark 55%. A year of rethinking energy supplies has not made Europe cleaner across the bloc. In Poland, which still relies on coal for much of its heating needs, the government has introduced a coal allowance and frozen electricity prices for individual households. After small and medium-sized businesses were struggling with energy bills multiple times the size of those in previous years, the government introduced a freeze for them. The crisis has meant a slowdown in plans in numerous countries to phase out coal, with the issue slipping further down the agenda in Poland, while in Bulgaria MPs voted recently to postpone plans to phase out coal-powered plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/eu-submits-final-text-talks-2015-iran-nuclear-deal-revival-tehran-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T18:25:31Z","webTitle":"EU team submit ‘final text’ at talks to salvage 2015 Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/eu-submits-final-text-talks-2015-iran-nuclear-deal-revival-tehran-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/eu-submits-final-text-talks-2015-iran-nuclear-deal-revival-tehran-washington","fields":{"bodyText":"The European Union has submitted a “final text” at talks to salvage the 2015 deal aimed at reining in Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The revival of the agreement now awaits “political decisions” in Tehran and Washington after negotiators in Vienna agreed the text thrashed out between Iranian and European representatives over the past five days was the final text and could not be amended further. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said: “What can be negotiated has been negotiated, and it’s now in a final text. However, behind every technical issue and every paragraph lies a political decision that needs to be taken in the capitals. If these answers are positive, then we can sign this deal.” The implication is that the EU is willing to accept the renegotiated deal, but political decisions still have to be made in the Iranian and US capitals. Prof Mohammad Marandi, an adviser to the Iranian negotiating team, struck a noncommittal note, stressing the text needed Washington’s agreement, and not that of Borrell. Borrell said: “Negotiators used these days of discussions and proximity talks between the US and Iran to fine tune and address – with technical adjustments – a handful of issues remaining in the text that I have put on the table last 21 July, as coordinator of the deal.” Mikhail Ulyanov, the lead Russian negotiator in Vienna, said: “If there is no opposition to the ‘final text’ draft, the nuclear agreement will be revived.” He said over the weekend that Russia had supported the amendments to the text proposed by the EU. The US described the tabled draft as “the best and only basis on which to reach a deal”. “For our part, our position is clear: we stand ready to quickly conclude a deal on the basis of the EU’s proposals,” a spokesperson for the state department said, suggesting the deal’s restoration was up to Iran. The first official reaction in Tehran was cautious, amid concerns the US would not deliver on the commitments made in the agreement. Robert Malley, the US special envoy in Iran who was also a lead negotiator on the 2015 deal, has been in Vienna over the past five days and has been consulted by the EU negotiating team. The final issues have included the extent to which the US guarantees sanctions are lifted not just nominally but operationally by providing credit guarantees. Tehran has also been pressing for the Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s elite military force, to be removed from the US list of foreign terrorist organisation, but appears to have adjusted the demand. Tehran has also been exploring the extent to which the US administration is willing to give binding commitments that any business contracts signed before the next US presidential elections will be honoured if a new administration in Washington again pulls out of the deal. Separately disputes had also continued with regards to inspections out at Iran’s nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Iran is asking the IAEA to close its investigation into the origins of nuclear particles found at three sites. So far the IAEA has said it has been given no credible explanation by Iran for the traces of nuclear particles, but has said the watchdog’s 35-member board of governors will close the inquiry if such an explanation is provided. Iran fears the IAEA may use the inquiry’s continued existence as a lever with which to demand wider access to Iranian sites well beyond the terms set out in the nuclear agreement. It also resents that the inquiry is based on intelligence provided by Israel. In March, the IAEA board passed a resolution condemning Iranian non-cooperation with the inquiry, and for cutting the watchdog’s access to sites it is allowed to inspect under the original 2015 nuclear deal. Mohammad Jamshidi, the political deputy of the Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, tweeted earlier in August that Raisi, in talks with the his French, Russian and Chinese counterparts, had firmly insisted the final agreement could only be closed when IAEA inquiry was dropped. Joe Biden, who is facing midterm elections, and Iran, which is looking for ways to revive its economy, are unlikely to be examining the final text of an agreement that has taken more than 11 months to negotiate. Instead, both will be considering the wider political and economic implications of throwing up the chance to normalise relations. A rejection of the deal by either Tehran or Washington, or both, will mean a resurgence of US sanctions and a probable decrease in Iranian oil and condensate exports from an estimated average of 1.5m barrels a day in 2022 to about 1m barrels through 2023 to 26. By contrast if the deal is accepted, Iranian exports could reach 2.5m barrels a day leading to a surge in Iranian revenues. Biden knows he will come under intense criticism from Israel, some Gulf states and the Republican party if he revives the deal since the agreement has relatively little time to run. At the same time he knows the risk of a nuclear arms race across the Middle East if no agreement exists covering Iran’s civilian atomic programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Russian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","fields":{"bodyText":"Seven sanctioned Russian companies, including a manufacturer of military helicopters deployed in the war in Ukraine, are visiting Saudi Arabia next week as part of a trade mission to increase business with the Gulf state. Companies including weapons manufacturers with direct links to the Russian military, state corporations involved in the invasion of Ukraine, and the agency overseeing a Ukrainian nuclear plant in the country seized by the Russian military last year, are set to attend. Saudi Arabia’s willingness to develop business ties with Russian companies sanctioned by western states for their role in the invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause further tensions in its already strained relationship with Washington. The Russian deputy industry and trade minister, Alexey Gruzdev, praised the trade event as the first of its kind. “Our business mission to Riyadh is aimed to strengthen the economic ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia, discover new business opportunities, exchange ideas and establish long-term partnership,” he said. Companies integral to the Russian military industrial sector are listed as attendees at the event in Riyadh on Monday. They include Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer of the Ka-52 Alligator helicopter. At least 35 Ka-52s have been shot down by Ukrainian forces or abandoned by Russia, according to the Dutch open-source outlet Oryx. Kamaz, an armoured vehicle manufacturer sanctioned for its role in aiding Russia’s war effort, is also listed as attending. Its trucks were spotted in Belarus in March 2022 carrying Iskander missiles that were allegedly launched in the early days of the invasion, and its Typhoon vehicles have also been reported transporting Russian soldiers across Ukrainian territory. Perhaps the most significant participant in the meetings with the Saudis is Rostec, a Russian state-owned defence systems and technology corporation that has supplied weapons used during the invasion of Ukraine. These included the Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower systems, the Zemledeliye remote mine-laying vehicles and various launch rocket systems. The US Treasury described Rostec as “the cornerstone of Russia’s defence, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors” in a sanctions notice published in June. Also listed as attending is Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company. According to Ukrainian officials and reports, Rosatom facilitated the Russian military’s seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last year, and has since taken over managing the facility. Rosatom denies the claims. A source familiar with the objectives of the Saudi trade event said Russian delegates were seeking to secure joint investment for business projects, assistance sustaining oil and gas prices and other diplomatic support. The source, who asked not to be named, said the Saudi investment ministry was exploring the possibility of opening an office in Moscow, and that a similar trade forum with Chinese businesses had also been held recently, although those businesses did not involve firms with connections to the Chinese military. “What is different here, and these recent business events are just one sign of it, is a major reorientation of Saudi policy towards Russia and China, and away from the USA and west Europe,” the source said. Saudi’s relationship with Moscow has created tensions in Washington. Last year, the kingdom sided with Russia over US interests when it decided to cut oil production shortly before the US midterm elections, prompting Joe Biden to threaten that the kingdom would face “consequences”. Asked about the planned Saudi-Russian trade meeting, a state department spokesperson said the US would continue to focus on “ensuring that our sanctions and export controls are properly enforced”. “We encourage countries and business to do their due diligence and refrain from conducting transactions with sanctioned persons, to avoid exposure to sanctions,” the spokesperson said. The US Treasury did not respond to a request for comment. The White House has backed off on its threats against Riyadh since last year. But anger towards the government of Mohammed bin Salman is still rife among Democrats and various Republicans on Capitol Hill, including some who have said they are concerned that Saudi Arabia could share sensitive US defence technology with its Russian allies. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman and longtime Saudi critic, said: “Saudi Arabia’s support for Russia in addition to its history of human rights violations should spark a serious review of the US-Saudi relationship.” Next week’s trade gathering could also frustrate the UK government, taking place shortly after a British trade mission aimed at securing an investment deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member. Seated next to the UK business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, at the Qatar Economic Forum this week, the Saudi investment minister, Khalid Al-Falih, declared Riyadh “the political capital of the Middle East”. Falih’s deputy is listed as a speaker of the Russian trade gathering next week. Saudi Arabia’s attempts to situate itself geopolitically as a partner to several leading powers – essentially playing all sides – was evident at a conference in California earlier this month, when Falih told business and political figures that Riyadh had no intention of being constrained by pre-existing relationships. He said: “We don’t feel that our relationship with the US is going to be at the expense of our ability to have relationships with other strong economic and political friends and partners around the world. This goes back to a multi-polar world where emerging middle powers … are going to be seeking their own interests.” Visibly irritated when asked about tensions between Washington and Riyadh, Falih observed that Saudi trade with China already exceeded that with the US and the EU combined. He said: “Do you expect us to put that at risk, just so that a certain country would feel that we’re on their side?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/18/australia-may-have-to-stop-making-key-cancer-medicine-if-it-doesnt-build-nuclear-waste-dump-peak-body-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T14:00:38Z","webTitle":"Australia may have to stop making key cancer medicine if it doesn’t build nuclear waste dump, peak body says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/australia-may-have-to-stop-making-key-cancer-medicine-if-it-doesnt-build-nuclear-waste-dump-peak-body-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/18/australia-may-have-to-stop-making-key-cancer-medicine-if-it-doesnt-build-nuclear-waste-dump-peak-body-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s peak nuclear organisation has warned it could be forced to cease production of life-saving cancer medicine if a controversial nuclear waste dump, planned for South Australia, is scrapped. The chief executive of Australia’s Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (Ansto), Shaun Jenkinson, said the federal government organisation would not be able to keep producing nuclear medicine if it ran out of waste storage space at its Lucas Heights facility. The federal government was planning to build a nuclear waste facility near Kimba in SA to store low level nuclear waste permanently, and intermediate level waste until a permanent solution was found. But it is facing legal challenges from the traditional owners, the Barngarla people, and opposition from the Greens and conservation groups who want the project cancelled. Liberal National senator Susan McDonald said Jenkinson’s claim was “confronting”. But the Australian Conservation Foundation said it risked causing unnecessary concern to vulnerable people. Ansto produces 80% of Australia’s nuclear medicine needs, including radiopharmaceuticals used to diagnose, monitor and treat cancers. Its Lucas Heights facility delivers up to 12,000 doses a week to hospitals and clinics around the country. Ansto’s current storage is projected to reach capacity by 2027, but new storage being built is expected to last a decade beyond that. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The SA site is meant to be ready by 2030. Jenkinson told senate estimates that a national repository was “best current practice” and that Lucas Heights – where low and intermediate level waste was now stored – was “never set up as a permanent waste facility”. Asked what would happen if the national facility was “delayed or cancelled”, Jenkinson said if the dump was cancelled, waste production would stop. “We would cease … some part of our operations,” he said. “Which could be things like nuclear medicine, if we didn’t have enough space on site to store the output. “It’s used in the diagnosis, staging and treatment of cancers, typically the larger amount of it has been used in diagnosis but we’re seeing therapeutics developed now, which are very exciting.” Jenkinson also said importing those medicines was “very challenging” because they have a short half-life; in some cases they only last for a few days. Those comments confirm a parliamentary report on Ansto’s need for extra storage. It found that, without the ability to store waste, Ansto would be “forced to cease nuclear medicine production, leading to major disruptions for Australia’s healthcare system”. Guardian Australia asked Ansto for more information about when it would no longer be able to safely store waste at Lucas Heights. A spokesperson said it would need more storage facilities by the end of next decade if the national facility did not go ahead, on top of the already planned extension. McDonald said the idea that Ansto might have to stop producing treatments was an “incredibly confronting thought”, while quizzing the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency in estimates. “We all have people in our lives who have benefited from Australia being able to produce its own nuclear medicine,” she said. Dave Sweeney, the ACF’s nuclear free campaigner, the Greens, and others, argue that waste could continue to be stored at Lucas Heights. “Linking continued nuclear medicine access to the development of a highly controversial radioactive waste plan in regional SA risks causing unnecessary concern to vulnerable people,” Sweeney said. “For years we have been assured by department officials that nuclear medicine production and supply is not dependent on the rushed development of a national radioactive waste facility.” He was also critical of a plan to move the intermediate level waste to the new facility, but only keep it there until a permanent spot was found. The Barngarla people said they were “deeply disappointed” that new studies had begun on the site. The federal government said “characterisations works” were necessary and did not constitute the beginning of construction. But Barngarla’s chair, Jason Bilney, said it was an “unwelcome escalation”. “Right now we are hearing a lot of talk about a voice to parliament. We want them to hear our Barngarla voice that says a very clear ‘no’,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T16:40:33Z","webTitle":"We need to revive the UK’s nuclear industry | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","fields":{"bodyText":"A reply is needed to the letters (23 March) objecting to political parties supporting nuclear power. How can the chairman of the British Energy Efficiency Federation dispute the statement that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”? Has he not realised that, to meet the climate crisis, the necessary replacement of fossil fuels in road transport and home heating requires electric-powered engines and heat pumps, respectively? Safe underground storage of nuclear waste has been developed. This has never been an insoluble problem. By contrast, little money has been spent on other waste products such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals and plastics. In comparison with nuclear waste, the poisonous effects of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium never decay with time. We need both nuclear power and power from renewables, the long-term storage of which is a real problem. It is sad that the UK government’s abandonment of support for nuclear industry development in the 1990s has led to the import of expensive foreign reactors. Our country needs a revived nuclear industry based on smaller, much cheaper reactors that are faster to build. Opposition to nuclear power has led to much higher emissions of CO2; for the past 40 years, the emissions from France, whose electricity has been mainly nuclear-powered, have been about 30% less per head than those from Germany. The current abandonment of nuclear power in Germany has not made sense because it has led to more burning of coal and a reliance on imported Russian fuels.

What’s behind the fighting? The clashes erupted in the middle of April amid an apparent power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime. The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler, while the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militia, follow the former warlord Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. The power struggle has its roots in the years before a 2019 uprising that ousted the dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir, who built up formidable security forces that he deliberately set against one another. When an effort to transition to a democratic civilian-led government faltered after Bashir’s fall, an eventual showdown appeared inevitable, with diplomats in Khartoum warning in early 2022 that they feared such an outbreak of violence. In the weeks before clashes broke out tensions had risen further. How did the military rivalries develop? The RSF was founded by Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago due to the political and economic marginalisation of the local people by Sudan’s central government. The RSF was also known by the name of Janjaweed, which became associated with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the Janjaweed into a semi-organised paramilitary force and gave their leaders military ranks before deploying them to crush a rebellion in South Darfur and then dispatching many to fight in the war in Yemen, and later Libya. The RSF, led by Hemedti, and the regular military forces under Burhan cooperated to oust Bashir in 2019. The RSF then dispersed a peaceful sit-in that was held in front of the military headquarters in Khartoum, killing hundreds of people and raping dozens more. A power-sharing deal with the civilians who led the protests against Bashir, which was supposed to bring about a transition towards a democratic government, was interrupted by a coup in October 2021. The coup put the army back in charge but it faced weekly protests, renewed isolation and deepening economic woes. Hemedti swung behind the plan for a new transition, bringing tensions with Burhan to the surface. Hemedti has huge wealth derived from the export of gold from illegal mines, and commands tens of thousands of battle-hardened veterans. He has long chafed at his position as official deputy on Sudan’s ruling council. What are the faultlines? A central cause of tension since the 2019 uprising has been the civilian demand for oversight of the military and integration of the RSF into the regular armed forces. Civilians have also called for the handover of lucrative military holdings in agriculture, trade and other industries - a crucial source of power for an army that has often outsourced military action to regional militias. Another point of contention is the pursuit of justice over allegations of war crimes by the military and its allies in the conflict in Darfur from 2003. The international criminal court is seeking trials for Bashir and other Sudanese suspects. Justice is also being sought over the killings of pro-democracy protesters in June 2019, in which military forces are implicated. Activists and civilian groups have been angered by delays to an official investigation. In addition, they want justice for at least 125 people killed by security forces in protests since the 2021 coup. What’s at stake in the region? Sudan is in a volatile region bordering the Red Sea, the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa. Its strategic location and agricultural wealth have attracted regional power plays, complicating the chances of a successful transition to civilian-led government. Several of Sudan’s neighbours – including Ethiopia, Chad and South Sudan – have been affected by political upheavals and conflict, and Sudan’s relationship with Ethiopia, in particular, has been strained over issues including disputed farmland along their border. Sudanese refugees have fled the recent fighting to the county’s neighbours, including thousands who have crossed into Chad. Major geopolitical dimensions are also at play, with Russia, the US, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other powers battling for influence in Sudan. The Saudis and the UAE have seen Sudan’s transition as an opportunity to push back against Islamist influence in the region. They, along with the US and Britain, form the “Quad”, which has sponsored mediation in Sudan along with the UN and the African Union. Western powers fear the potential for a Russian base on the Red Sea, to which Sudanese military leaders have expressed openness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/24/morning-mail-defence-budget-not-limitless-marles-warns-albaneses-approval-dips-djokovic-on-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T19:57:20Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: defence budget ‘not limitless’, Marles warns; Albanese’s approval dips; Djokovic on fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/24/morning-mail-defence-budget-not-limitless-marles-warns-albaneses-approval-dips-djokovic-on-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/24/morning-mail-defence-budget-not-limitless-marles-warns-albaneses-approval-dips-djokovic-on-fire","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

The 12 clues that foreshadowed Succession’s ultimate winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/did-the-poster-give-it-away-the-12-clues-that-foreshadowed-successions-ultimate-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/did-the-poster-give-it-away-the-12-clues-that-foreshadowed-successions-ultimate-winner","fields":{"bodyText":"Spoiler alert: this article is for people who have watched Succession season four. Don’t read on unless you’ve seen the finale, episode 10. Tightrope Tom-Wam. Mr Normcore. The puffy-vested meat puppet. Disgusting Brother Senior. Tomlette the clumsy interloper. The man who dressed like a divorce attorney from the Twin Cities. As anticipation built for Succession’s last ever episode and fan theories proliferated, few predicted that it would be son-in-law Tom Wambsgans who would ultimately ascend to the Waystar Royco throne. Yet maybe, just maybe, the seeds had been sown all along. Here are 12 hidden clues that foreshadowed Tom’s triumph … 1. His surname Fans have long speculated about hidden meanings of Succession characters’ names – “Roy” meaning king, the mythical significance of “Romulus”, “Shiv” meaning a bladed weapon (she did indeed knife Kendall in the finale). Last week on TikTok, the baby-naming website Nameberry proposed a wild but compelling theory about Tom’s rare German surname (which, it says, translates literally as “fat-bellied goose”). An extra “s” aside, he shares it with the Major League Baseball player Bill Wambsganss. As second baseman for the Cleveland Indians during the 1920s, Wambsganss is famed for completing the only unassisted triple play in World Series history, taking out three opponents at once. A century later, his namesake took out all three Roy siblings. Coincidence? Probably, yes. But a kinda cool one. 2. His outsider status Frequently the butt of family jokes, Tom was never fully part of the Roy clan, but frankly, who would want to be? Cosseted childhoods and cruel parents meant the siblings were all deeply damaged, incapable of continuing their father’s legacy. Those with proximity to power but none of the baggage were a better bet. Cousin Greg occupied a similar position, leading many fans to tip him to come out on top. However, Greg was too gauche, too clumsy in his scheming, not machiavellian enough (yet). He was always destined to be Sporus the castrated slave boy to Tom’s Emperor Nero. 3. The word “Succession” The notion of inherited power is right there in the show’s title. Our last glimpse of Tom and Shiv, holding hands (sort of) in the back of that car, hinted that Shiv had already accepted her new role as queen consort. She also happens to be pregnant with a natural heir. Unlike Kendall’s children, their baby is pure Roy bloodline and Logan’s only biological grandchild. The cycle continues. 4. The hand on his shoulder It was one of the most spine-tingling moments of the entire show. In the season three finale, the siblings’ attempted coup failed because turncoat Tom had tipped off Logan. This was confirmed by Logan fondly touching Tom’s shoulder, a gesture spotted from across the room by the incandescent Shiv. It meant that Tom spent season four in the inner circle, with Shiv and her brothers stuck on the periphery. So it would remain. Logan didn’t want any of his feckless offspring to inherit the family firm. He wanted to sell it to Matsson, died doing so and ultimately got his wish, with trusted consigliere Tom at the new owner’s shoulder. 5. His ATN gig As head of ATN, Tom had his well-manicured hands on the levers of power and the ability to anoint presidents. We often heard how the Fox-esque rolling news network was Logan’s crown jewel. His pride and joy. The one thing he wanted to keep after selling off the rest of his sprawling media conglomerate. The head of ATN was de facto the most important person in his empire. Who better to take the top job? 6. Stealing the chicken One of Tom’s most memorable moments was aboard the superyacht in season two’s finale, when he walked over to Logan and helped himself to the food off his plate. He said brazenly, “Thank you for the chicken”, and walked away. “What next?” demanded Logan. “Stick his cock in my potato salad?” None of the Roy siblings would dare attempt such a poultry-based power move. He literally ate Logan’s lunch. 7. His role in Logan’s death As Tom reminded Shiv (and us viewers) in the penultimate episode, he was right by Logan’s side during his final moments aboard that fateful private jet to Stockholm. Tom broke into the plane bathroom after Logan had collapsed. It was Tom who became the conduit between the family on the ground and Logan in the air, holding a phone by his ear, even though he was likely already dead. He was the only one who got a chance to say goodbye. Another sign that he would always be in the right place when it mattered. 8. Shiv’s motherly parallels Toxic aristocrat Lady Caroline Collingwood often taunted her daughter Siobhan that she was a chip off the old block, especially when it came to motherhood. “We’re not cut out for it,” she brayed. “I should’ve had dogs.” Yet perhaps Shiv was destined to turn into her mother in another way – reduced to being the unhappy wife of a powerful Waystar CEO. 9. ‘I’m here to serve’ This became Tom’s catchphrase in the wake of Logan’s death. Without the patriarch’s protection – “The only guy pulling for you is dead”, as Karl put it gleefully – Tom was left casting around for new family allies. He pitched for their patronage by emphasising his servile nature and willingness to carry out orders. Kendall and Roman both brushed him away but GoJo mogul Lukas Matsson was smart enough to end up listening. 10. The poster teaser Fans flipped after episode three, retrospectively spotting a portent of Logan’s death in the season four poster – a plane in the sky hinted at where he would perish. Was there another clue on the poster all along? Shiv stands with folded arms, her facial expression conveying that she is making a calculated decision. Yet the reflection shows Tom standing in front of her. A visual hint that she would end up behind her husband in the race for the family business? 11. Matthew Macfadyen being a Brit A little flag-wavingly patriotic, this one, but think about it. Jesse Armstrong and many of his writing team are British. Actor Brian Cox – and indeed, Logan Roy himself – are proud Scots. Perhaps it was always likely to be a fellow Briton who would ascend to his throne. Furthermore, Tom’s string-puller Lukas Matsson and actor Alexander Skarsgård are both Swedish. Those Americans simply weren’t up to the job. Sorry, Gerri, but we Europeans weren’t so soft (let alone hammocked in our social security safety nets, sick on vacation mania and free healthcare) after all. 12. The royal sceptre Remember season two’s shareholder meeting, when Logan became “the piss-mad king of England” due to a urinary tract infection? Tom handled his ailing, incoherent father-in-law so well, it was really rather touching. “Do you want me to hold the sceptre?” he asked gently in the bathroom stall. “You’re a very good boy,” slurred Logan. Tom really is holding the sceptre now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:00:21Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

The ex-paratrooper understood he was risking prison, that he would be called a traitor and would be shunned by his former comrades-in-arms. His own mother had urged him to flee Russia while he still could. He said it anyway. “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here,” he told Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer over a tucked-away cafe table in the Moscow financial district. It was his first time sitting down in person with a journalist since returning from the war in Ukraine. Two weeks ago, Filatyev published a 141-page bombshell: a day-by-day description of how his paratrooper unit was sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea to enter Kherson and capture the seaport. It is the most detailed voluntary account from a Russian soldier participating in the invasion of Ukraine. Filatyev described how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine behind a hail of rocket fire in late February, with little in terms of concrete logistics or objectives, and no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he explained. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’” Ukraine hints it was behind Crimea attack A series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase this week, Luke Harding reports. Smoke billowed into the sky near Dzhankoi on Tuesday while several explosions appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. According to Russian media, a further blast took place at a military airfield in the village of Hvardeyskye, not far from Crimea’s regional capital, Simferopol. While not formally confirming responsibility for the strike, Kyiv officials reacted with glee on social media “The reasons for the explosions in the occupied territory can be different, very different, in particular, I quote the definition of the occupiers themselves, ‘bungling’,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mused in an evening address. Kyiv has hit Crimea three times in a week, in clinical and flamboyant style. Russia’s logistics and weapons dumps have been badly affected. ‘It’s madness’: Putin turns nuclear plant into frontline The situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is perilous, Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry reported from Nikopol, the Ukrainian-held city 7km away on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River. The plant – Europe’s largest – is now on the frontline between Russian-occupied and Ukrainian-controlled territory. Russia is using the sprawling site as a military base from which it has been shelling the nearby towns of Nikopol and Marhanets. According to Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, Russia has fired on the plant several times. Shells landed close to the fire station and director’s office, not far from a radioactive sources storage unit. The International Atomic Energy Agency has demanded access and called on the Russians to demilitarise it to avoid a possible nuclear disaster. One former senior employee, who spoke to Luke Harding on the condition of anonymity, said the Russians were shelling the plant from surrounding villages and roads with the goal of raising the stakes in negotiations with Kyiv. But the Kremlin is also trying to do something unprecedented: to steal another state’s nuclear reactor, he adds. Engineers are working to connect the facility to the electricity grid in occupied Crimea and cut it off from Ukrainian homes. One reactor has already been knocked out. It is a ghoulish game of radioactive Russian roulette, in a country that has known the 1986 Chornobyl atomic disaster. Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv covered the moment Zelenskiy vowed his forces would target Russian soldiers who shot at or from the plant. Russia is resorting to “unconcealed nuclear blackmail”, Zelenskiy alleged. A “terrorist state”, it was threatening the “whole world” with Armageddon. He urged the UN and international community to do something. Ukraine aiming to create chaos within Russian forces, Zelenskiy adviser says Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to those which struck Crimea. Speaking from the presidential offices in Kyiv, Podolyak said: “Our strategy is to destroy the logistics, the supply lines and the ammunition depots and other objects of military infrastructure. It’s creating a chaos within their own forces.” The adviser, often described as the country’s third most powerful figure, said Kyiv’s approach ran counter to Moscow’s use of blunt artillery power to gain territory in the Donbas region to the east, which has seen Russian troops destroy cities such as Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk in order to gain territory. “So Russia has kind of taught everybody that a counteroffensive requires huge amounts of manpower like a giant fist and just go in one direction,” he said, but “a Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different. We don’t use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century.” ‘A referendum is not right’: occupied Kherson looks to uncertain future “A city with a Russian history,” proclaim billboards across the Ukrainian city of Kherson, occupied by the Russian army since the first days of March. Others display the Russian flag, or quotes from Vladimir Putin. Over the past five months, Moscow has appointed an occupation administration to run the Kherson region and ordered schools to teach the Russian curriculum. Local people are encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access pensions and other benefits. The next stage of the Kremlin’s plan is a referendum, to add a dubious sense of legality to these facts on the ground, and create a pretext for bringing Kherson and other occupied parts of southern Ukraine into Russia, using an updated version of the 2014 Crimea playbook. “You have to remember there was never any talk in Kherson of a referendum; no one thought about it before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint,” said Kostyantyn, who worked in the IT sector before the occupation, told Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer. Calls grow for a Russian visa ban Thousands of Russians have flocked to Europe on short-term visas since the country invaded Ukraine, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer report. Some sought an escape from repression, while summer has brought Russian tourists just looking to escape to the beach. Now some European politicians are calling for an end to the short-term visas that allow Russians to holiday in the EU as the war in Ukraine rages on. “They need to see a free world,” said Ilya Krasilshchik, a Russian online publisher who has been threatened with prosecution in Russia for opposing the war and is currently in Europe. “The experience of the Soviet Union shows that closing borders doesn’t lead to overthrow of the regime.” The British passport-holding son of a Russian businessman said wealthy Russians would probably find a way around any ban. “The elite will always find a way to get to Europe,” he said. “Many of my generation went to school here. We have lived long enough in the west to receive residency permits or a second passport … There will always be loopholes for those with money.” Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/24/the-defence-review-says-australia-is-at-little-risk-of-a-land-invasion-but-thats-not-where-the-threats-end","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T08:38:26Z","webTitle":"The defence review says Australia is at little risk of a land invasion – but that’s not where the threats end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/the-defence-review-says-australia-is-at-little-risk-of-a-land-invasion-but-thats-not-where-the-threats-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/the-defence-review-says-australia-is-at-little-risk-of-a-land-invasion-but-thats-not-where-the-threats-end","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s defence strategic review paints an alarming picture of the “radically different” security outlook in the Indo-Pacific, including the risk of “major conflict in the region that directly threatens our national interest”. But it is important to be very clear about what Monday’s document does and doesn’t say about the threats Australia faces. First, the review by the former defence chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith does not say Australia is at any significant risk of direct invasion. But it seeks to argue that this frame is too narrow to get a true picture of the regional outlook. Critics of the Australian government’s approach – including the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating – have sought to play down concerns about China’s rapid military buildup, saying it reflects the relative shift in power from the US and that Australia’s direct interests are not threatened. “All great battles are fought on land. They’re fought as invasions,” Keating said in his memorable outing at the National Press Club last month. “What would be the point of China wanting to occupy Sydney and Melbourne, militarily, and could they ever do it? “Could they ever bring the numbers here? It would be an armada of troop ships to do it. So you don’t need a briefing from the dopey security agencies we have in Canberra to tell you that.” But here is how Houston and Smith describe the risks to Australia. “While there is at present only a remote possibility of any power contemplating an invasion of our continent, the threat of the use of military force or coercion against Australia does not require invasion,” they say in their report compiled by the government. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “More countries are able to project combat power across greater ranges, including against our trade and supply routes, which are vital for Australia’s economic prosperity. “Cyber warfare is not bound by geography. The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare, crystallised by the proliferation of long-range precision strike weapons, has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits, the comfort of distance and our qualitative regional capability edge.” The review says “any adversary” could attempt to coerce Australia through cyber-attacks, incursions in Australia’s north-west shelf or parts of its exclusive economic zone or through disruptions to sea lines of communication. For years Chinese officials have been urging Australia to make a clear choice on whether it sees China’s rise as an opportunity for Australia or a security threat. The defence strategic review does not categorise it neatly into one of those binaries. It attempts, perhaps awkwardly, to reconcile the benefits of China’s economic development with concern about a military buildup “occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China’s strategic intent”. “China’s military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the second world war. This has occurred alongside significant economic development, benefiting many countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Australia,” the report says. While the report doesn’t categorise China as a direct military threat to Australia, it does say that Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in the contested South China Sea “threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests”. It labels intense competition between China and the US as “the defining feature of our region and our time” and warns of “the increased risk of miscalculation or misjudgment”. In the government’s formal response to the review, Richard Marles insists the government continues to view a “stable” relationship with China as being in the interests of both countries and the broader region and that they will seek to manage their differences “wisely”. In all likelihood, the Chinese government will criticise the language used in the report (Kevin Rudd’s defence white paper of 2009 triggered denunciations from Beijing for warning that “the pace, scope and structure of China’s military modernisation have the potential to give its neighbours cause for concern”). But the truth is that Australia’s defence settings – including the pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines as part of Aukus – were already factored in to Beijing’s calculations when it reopened the door to Canberra last year. So what does all this mean for the Australia Defence Force’s overarching mission? The government has set the ADF a five-point mission that extends well beyond defending the continent and Australia’s northern approaches. In addition to these elements, the ADF will be asked to protect Australia’s economic connections, “contribute with our partners to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific” and “contribute with our partners to the maintenance of the global rules-based order”. In short, the ADF will seek to project military power further from Australia’s shores, including through the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines and longer range missiles. The strategic review also takes a look at the role of Australia’s top security ally, the US, which is “no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific”. The review certainly doesn’t suggest walking away from the alliance, but argues Australia “must be more self-reliant”. It also calls for investing in partnerships with countries across the region, including south-east Asia and the Pacific. Australian officials have not forgotten the Donald Trump presidency, characterised by an “America First” approach that was openly dismissive or hostile to some of the US’s alliance partners. It seems unlikely Trump will be the last to give voice to an isolationist view in the decades ahead. But the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was very brief when asked on Monday for his assessment of the reliability of the US as an ally in the decades ahead. “The US remains an important ally. It’s a relationship between nations, it’s a relationship between peoples and it’s based upon our common values,” he said. It is all part of a picture which, according to Albanese, reflects Australia’s “most challenging strategic circumstances since the second world war”.

The former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain will table an amendment to the Northern Ireland protocol bill in the House of Lords on Wednesday to protect the so-called single energy market (SEM), which allows power to be traded with the island of Ireland as one economic unit. He fears that if the bill were to become law access to the SEM would disappear, disrupting Northern Ireland’s energy supply. Such is the significance of the SEM that two years ago government officials feared thousands of electricity generators sited on barges would have to be sent to the Northern Ireland coast to maintain energy supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit. “It is our duty – not the EU’s – to keep the lights on in Northern Ireland,” said Lord Hain. “If the EU decides to prevent the continued free flow of goods and electricity across the Irish border because of the removal of CJEU [the court of justice of the European Union] from the protocol, it would be not a sign of its malintent but rather a well-flagged consequence of the wanton recklessness of the government in writing the bill in this way,” he is expected to tell peers in the House of Lords. The single energy market is seen as a triumph of cooperation between Northern Ireland and the republic in the post-Troubles era. Whitehall papers leaked in 2018 suggested that electricity bills could rise by up to £200, diesel generators would be needed to keep power supplies running and energy companies could collapse. Hain said the impact of the skeleton protocol bill going through the Lords involves “unknowable consequences” because “so much of its effect will come through powers that are neither clearly demarcated nor spelled out”. He added that he did not doubt that a continuing role for the European court of justice could be finessed to sustain the SEM but it would have to be negotiated outside this bill. “By amending the bill to avoid such a situation in which the removal of the CJEU jurisdiction could have unintended consequences for the operation of the single electricity market – which the government has been clear it wishes to keep fully functioning – we would at least ensure no disruption to electricity supplies in NI even if it loses free access to the EU’s single market for goods,” Hain will say. Labour stepped up its campaign to halt the Northern Ireland protocol making it to the statue books intact, with 22 amendments tabled 10 days ago. Jenny Chapman, a shadow Cabinet Office minister in the Lords, told the Guardian the bill was “an abomination, undermining the UK’s hard-won reputation as a responsible, trustworthy partner” and called on the government to “scrap this reckless legislation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/24/rishi-sunak-israel-democracy-netanyahu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-24T10:22:54Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak can’t afford to ignore Israel’s collapsing democracy –its everyone’s problem | Eran Yashiv","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/24/rishi-sunak-israel-democracy-netanyahu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/24/rishi-sunak-israel-democracy-netanyahu","fields":{"bodyText":"As Rishi Sunak now meets the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he and other western leaders should be worried about the events unfolding in Israel over the past 11 weeks. Israel may be on the verge of transitioning from a liberal democracy to a nondemocratic weak state. There are potential geopolitical risks, not just within Israel but in the wider Middle East, that its allies should be gravely concerned about. The recent legislation proposed by Netanyahu’s coalition government consists of curtailing judicial review of legislation, changes to the makeup of the judicial selection committee designed to ensure the government controls appointments to the bench, cancellation of supreme court intervention in cases of extremely unreasonable executive orders, and the transformation of ministerial legal advisers into political appointees. More quietly, a number of additional laws are in the process of being enacted. These are designed to allow politicians on trial, or even convicted ones, to serve in ministerial roles. In particular, they are designed to allow Netanyahu, on trial for almost three years on corruption charges, to escape his current legal predicaments. The proposed changes are meeting fierce resistance. Yet the governing coalition has rejected President Herzog’s compromise plan and has resorted to a change of tactics on implementing its comprehensive programme. If implemented, these plans will spell the end of democracy in Israel. They break the power of the supreme court to counter governmental decisions and parliamentary laws, in a country with one chamber of parliament and no constitution. Inter alia, the economic consequences will be dramatic. The main socioeconomic outcome is that the linchpin of Israel’s economy, the hi-tech sector, is likely to leave. Indeed, it has actually started to do so. This emigration shock will have far-ranging consequences, as there are large, weaker sectors that essentially live off the strength of the hi-tech sector, which contributes 25% of Israel’s income tax revenues. No wonder there are early signs of capital flight: the chief economist of the Treasury estimates a 0.8% annual decline in GDP per capita growth over the next decade; and foreign banks and credit rating agencies have issued warnings, as have prominent economists, including Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke. These developments come in conjunction with a more subtle and slow-developing process of religious forces seeking to turn Israel into a country governed by Jewish law. If successful, it would ultimately turn Israel into a clerical state. This agenda is being pursued by two big minority groups. One is the ultra-Orthodox, who now constitute 13% of Israel’s population and are forecasted to be a third of it by 2065. The second is the so-called Zionist religious group, which is as big as the ultra-Orthodox, using conservative estimates. Together they are now represented by 32 Knesset members (out of 120) and are part of the governing coalition. Through high rates of population growth, their size and power are likely to increase. One indication of that is the results of the November national elections in the city of Jerusalem, where the parties in question won 56% of the vote, while they got only 25% in the national vote. Jerusalem has often been a harbinger of future political developments. As the confluence of judicial reforms and imposition of religion leave Israel economically weakened, the government will look for scapegoats. Playing by the book of illiberal, if not theocratic, states, they will target domestic and foreign “enemies”. Domestically, the “natural” target, already disadvantaged, are Arab citizens, making up about 20% of the population. It is likely, via a gradual, disguised process, they will be denied voting rights. Externally the enemy is, and will remain, Iran, which will have greater incentives to cross the nuclear threshold for a variety of reasons. First, an unchecked rightwing government in Israel, with plenty of irresponsible extremists in the cabinet, is a threat. Especially because it may also seek to blame its economic weakness on external enemies. Add to this, the emerging divisions within Israel, for example citizens refusing military service, may actually weaken it, and may be tempting to exploit. And finally, the US and the wider west are less likely to support a nondemocratic, belligerent Israel. This is a whole new ballgame. The western world will face a changed Middle East with the danger of nuclear confrontation. Stopping these tragic dynamics now, before legislation has passed, will be considerably more feasible than in the future. The current path looks irreversible. True friendship with the Israeli nation requires western leaders to convey a clear message to Netanyahu and his rogue government. Thus far, President Biden, Chancellor Scholz and President Macron have indeed done so. They must have realised that Netanyahu, the self-anointed champion of the Iran issue, is ironically leading Iran down a nuclear path. Foreign pressure may provide the more moderate elements of the governing coalition with a ladder to climb down, before Israel heads into the abyss and wreaks havoc in the Middle East.

The actor won the television award on Sunday for her portrayal of a mother whose teenage daughter suffers from mental health problems as a result of viewing damaging online content. Accepting the award for best leading actress for Channel 4 drama I am Ruth, in which she acted alongside her real-life daughter, Mia Threapleton, Winslet said: “We want our children back.” She added: “For young people who have become addicted to social media and its darker sides, this does not need to be your life. To people in power, and to people who can make change, please, criminalise harmful content.” The Molly Rose Foundation, established by the family of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing material related to self-harm and suicide on social media, said it was time the government “listened to the chorus of concerned parents” and delivered strong legislation on shielding young people from damaging digital content. Referring to Prince William’s call for better protection of children online following an inquest into Russell’s death last year, a spokesperson for the foundation said: “It makes no difference if you are the winner of a best actress Bafta or the heir to the throne: families across the UK are concerned about keeping children safe in our unregulated digital world. “It’s not only the readily found harmful content that causes concern, but also the tech platforms’ algorithms that push digital dangers to vulnerable young people every day.” The spokesperson added that the government must deliver an online safety bill that addressed the scale of the problem. The bill imposes a duty of care on tech firms to shield children from harmful content, but members of the House of Lords are currently trying to strengthen the legislation. A cross-party group of peers, led by the former culture secretary Nicky Morgan, will put forward a range of measures when the bill is debated in the upper chamber on Tuesday. Under the proposals, social media bosses could face jail terms of up to two years for persistent breaches. Beeban Kidron, a leading online safety campaigner, said: “Kate Winslet is giving voice to what millions of parents and children are expressing.” Lady Kidron added that the government was “pushing back” on some amendments in the upper chamber. Peers are seeking changes including stronger rules on age-checking measures and setting out children’s rights on the face of the bill.“I would like a commitment from No 10 to strengthening the bill for children, and for parliament as a whole to put its weight behind the needs of children to thrive online.” The NSPCC said Winslet’s remarks would “resonate with parents up and down the country”. “Regulation will start to bring the tech sector in line with other industries and ensure they have to assess and mitigate the risks of their products so they are safe for young users, but the pushback from some companies will be considerable,” said Rani Govender, senior child safety online policy officer at the NSPCC, which is calling for the bill to introduce an independent child online safety advocate. A government spokesperson said the “world-leading” online safety bill would protect children on a range of platforms including social media networks, video-sharing sites and search engines, and that companies that breached the act would face fines of up to 10% of global turnover. “Protecting children from being exposed to harmful content and behaviour such as bullying is an absolute priority for the government,” said the spokesperson.

They bowled out Somerset for 202 before powering to 405 for seven, with an opening stand of 176 between Zak Crawley and Tawanda Muyeye and a half-century from Ollie Robinson in his final game before he moves to Durham. Kent’s position was confirmed when Warwickshire declared against Hampshire at Edgbaston. At the lunch interval on what Kent had declared “Stevo day” the departing Darren Stevens did a lap of honour shaking hands with the crowd, and Kent announced they had retired the No 3 shirt in his honour. Kent’s survival means a shootout between Warwickshire and Yorkshire to join Gloucestershire in Division Two. Just 32 overs were possible at Edgbaston, on a day when the players played push me‑pull me with the weather, but Rob Yates did grab a hundred in what has been a frustrating year. Yorkshire stumbled badly at Headingley, first being bowled out for 183, as Zafar Gohar took five for 40; then allowing Gloucestershire to build a lead of 211. In the Division Two promotion games, Nottinghamshire are almost assured Division One status after scoring 662 for five declared against Durham, with centuries for Lyndon James and Steven Mullaney. Middlesex were thwarted by the weather in their match against Worcestershire at New Road, but there was time for Pieter Malan to hit a half‑century. Centuries for Shubman Gill and Chris Cooke put Glamorgan in a powerful position against Sussex at 533 for nine declared. The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Essex would not be docked any points for an unfit pitch following their match against Lancashire at Chelmsford last week. The match ended in just over four sessions, with 26 wickets falling on the first day. The match referee Wayne Noon adjudged it “poor”; the ECB then had to judge to decide whether there should be a points deduction based on whether – with the information available – Essex had actively sought to prepared the best quality pitch they could Lancashire’s director of cricket, Glenn Chapple, had called the pitch “completely ridiculous” after Lancashire at one point found themselves six for seven in their second innings just before stumps on day one. • This post was amended on 30 September 2022 to describe Darren Stevens as departing from Kent, instead of retiring. It’s dark and time to close the blog – with Kent safe, Notts there bar the locks,but Warwickshire-Yorkshire-Glamorgan-Middlesex still ripe with possibility. Till tomorrow, good night! Warwickshire’s declaration ensured that. So its’a t Yorks v Warwicks shoot-ou to join Gloucestershire in Division Two next year. With bad light stopping play at Hove, Canterbury and New Road, Durham one down, the Yorkies in a spot of bother (Gloucs 196-5) and Hampshire just starting their innings – I’m going to have to pause to do the write up. They’re about to resume at Edgbaston and the news is Warwickshire have declared on 272 for four. Time for a bit of a dart at the Hampshire openers before the light becomes a factor. Beautiful symmetry – Tom Curran drives high and straight, and holds the pose as his middle and leg stumps leave the ground. Pure Will Williams. Surrey 110-5. rain approaching fast from the left. As Gloucestershire extend their lead over Yorkshire to 185…trouble at t’mill. Bad light halts Middlesex’s innings at 141 for two. Sussex are not playing the game – currently 65-o at Hove against gnashing-of-teeth Glamorgan. Tom Curran playing a very different innings to his barnstorming maiden century the other week – currently 7 from 35 balls: Surrey 106-4. They’re back on at New Road, Middx 127-2. Sussex are merrily 57-0 off seven overs against Glamorgan. Brooding skies over OT. At Wantage Road, Essex – heady with avoiding a points deduction – have Northants 19 for one, Emilio Gay out, of course, to Sam Cook. Rain at OT and Edgbaston. Kent powering onwards against Somerset – the lead now 174 – Ollie Robinson bowled for 52 in his penultimate innings for Kent. Cover on; cover off at Old Trafford. Gutting for Warwickshire, as Gloucestershire build a could-be-challenging total at Headingley: 158 for five. Jack Taylor and Ollie Price have put on an unbeaten 89 for the sixth wicket. I’m not sure I fancy the Yorkies with anything over 180 – the current lead 170. All not well at second-from-bottom placed Sussex. So, after consultation: Glamorgan can be promoted if they win with maximum points and Middlesex are bowled out below 300 and don’t win. Does that sound right? Just the 662-5. Glamorgan declare, Kent get a third bonus point, Derbyshire – sorry, I haven’t mentioned you all day, are 298 for one thanks to centuries from Reece and Godleman. Notts – still batting. Rain at New Road. No gold for Lancashire this year O Notts are bashing poor Durham: Hameed (115), Montgomery (178), James (159 not out) and Mullaney (129). Do they want 700? 800? Currently 651 for four and seven weary Durham bowlers. It briefly rained at Old Trafford, now the sun is out again, but clouds hover stage left. Surrey 105-4. There will be no points deduction for Essex after last week’s game at Chelmsford against Lancashire finished in just over four sessions. The match referee Wayne Noon rated it as poor, after talking to umpires, head coaches, captains and groundsman. The ECB then had their own enquiry to decide whether there should be a points deduction , based on whether – with the information available – Essex had actively sought to prepared the best quality pitch they could. Lancashire head coach Glenn Chapple called the pitch “completely ridiculous” after the first day, when 26 wickets fell, and Lancs at one stage found themselves six for seven: “We’ve got lads in really good form having really good seasons who are desperate to win a game, and they’ve just found the pitch unplayable really. “Obviously the surface of the pitch looks poor. The ball is coming off it different every time. If you watch the batters’ innings through they can’t lay a bat on it.” Eton v Harrow will go ahead next year, as will Oxford v Cambridge, after an MCC compromise with revolting members. MCC confirmed that the Special General Meeting due this evening, has been cancelled – and instead there will be a further vote on the fixtures next May. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 298-4 v Somerset 202 Old Trafford: Lancashire 512 v Surrey 96-4 rain Wantage Road: Northants v Essex 231-9 Edgbaston: Warwicks 272-4 v Hampshire Headingley: Yorkshire 183 v Gloucestershire 190 and 110-5 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 281-1 v Leicestershire 249 Trent Bridge: Notts 577-4 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Glamorgan 489-8 New Road: Worcs 225 v Middlesex 111-2 rain There’s a bit of pongo unfolding at Edgbaston, with Will Rhodes driving in the fast lane and Dan Mouseley whacking the ball in the direction of Moseley. Rhodes has just taken Holland for four, six, four before smacking one back into the right-armer’s wrist and forcing a brief stoppage in play. Technically a chance but even Chris Jordan might have struggled to hold on, such was the ferocity of the shot. Warwickshire 263 for four in the 70th over and have secured a second batting bonus point. As they take tea round the grounds… Amla strides slowly off, like a hedgehog contemplating his winter hideaway, another smart catch by Jennings, another good ball by Balderson – who is having quite the end to the season. Well, I suppose I only have myself to blame. After praising the ability of Yates to reset after each stoppage, a five-minute pause for rain is followed, first ball, by the opener driving at an inswinger and being bowled by Ian Holland. To make matters worse for Warwickshire, as they get wind of wickets tumbling at Headingley, they’ve now lost two in four balls with Sam Hain wafting behind off James Fuller on 44. The hosts are now 216 for four, with Will Rhodes and Dan Mousley both new to the crease. Amla taking Parky on – slamming into the seats over long on- after driving him for four the ball before. Surrey 79 for three. After a season of frustration comes a century for Rob Yates as shouts of “You Bears” echo around Edgbaston. It took the left-hander 179 balls to reach his seventh in first-class cricket, slotting 19 fours along the way. As well as some crisp strokeplay, a feature has been an ability to reset after the countless stoppages for rain. Warwickshire are getting a wriggle on here, with Sam Hain moving to 44 not out and the score to 214 for two from 60.5 overs. And as I type that, we’re off for rain... An email! Thank you Matt Winter: “Hello Tanya. Bracey carrying the shire like Atlas. Again. He must be ruddy fed up as another red ball season dribbles into the ditch of history. Can’t fault his loyalty to us but a small bit of me thinks “RUN YOU FOOL”” Indeed – Bracey 39 not out in Gloucs 69-3 – And it seems a lifetime ago that he had that England chance. Some players get oodles of luck, others not so much. Perhaps Headingley is the game to be at tomorrow – though I’ll have to take a hot-water bottle. As I type that a third wicket falls, GLous 61 for three, two for Coad, one for Bess and the lead 68. An interesting development reported in the Telegraph – England have offered to host neutral India v Pakistan Tests. But perhaps the punchiest paragraph comes later on when Nick Hoult writes about the South African T20 league – which seem to be continuing the IPL’s outrageous boycott of Pakistan players. This I had no idea about. “Pakistan players are also barred from playing in the IPL, a scenario that could spread if IPL owners buy teams in other leagues. For example, no Pakistan players are playing in the South Africa T20 league in February where all the teams have India owners, raising questions about the influence of private investment in national leagues.” I don’t pretend to know about high finance – but if ultimately the ECB do want private equity in the Hundred, this is a big one. It’s damp and slidey out there, the wind ruffles Tom Bailey’s trousers unkindly as he walks back to his mark. I feel in my bones that Surrey just want go home – though they won’t want to lose that unbeaten record. Anyone got a warm rock cake just out of the oven? So maximum batting points for Glamorgan…but now it is raining. Middlesex, who, remember, have a nine point advantage over Glamorgan (pats top pocket like a Middlesex supporter) are approaching fast on Worcestershire’s 225. Currently 107 for 2; Malan 55 not out. I haven’t listened to this, but might be one for a rainy day in the coming weeks. Groundsmen in woolly hats standing over the hover cover at OT. Hashim Amla strides off in what is – reportedly – his last game for Surrey, and the Hover Cover hums into place. Surrey 42-3. And a black bin bag drifts slowly down past the press box window. A third wicket for Potts at the Nottinghamshire feast – 441 for four. Montgomery out for 178. Glamorgan striving for the 400 – now seven down, Cooke 69 not out. A handy 44 extras from Sussex. Always out – Jamie Smith gone for one, lbw to Tom Bailey, done like a kipper. Surrey 38 for three and without Foakes and Pope. Spotted in the OT box – though not by me – George Bell standing up to Rory Burns to stop his prancing down the pitch, probably resulted in him being stuck in his crease when that Will Williams ball arrived. Bell now right back with the slip cordon, far enough away to sketch a water-colour. Bails scattering like hundreds and thousands as Rory Burns misses a peach from Will Williams. Surrey 37-2. An early Surrey wicket – Ryan Patel – and Tom Bailey’s fiftieth wicket of the season. Guided into the safe hands of Keaton Jennings. Rory Burns very eager to prance out of his crease, 16 not out. All Lancashire’s slip cordon, in fact all Lancashire’s fielders, have their hands in their pockets – handwarmers, surely. Those red-rose fleecy jumpers don’t look as warm as the Surrey cable-knit. Darren Stevens has a seriously good skin-care regime. Where are the wrinkles? The match at Headingley cracking on: Ben Coad on the money again, Gloucestershire already one down. But the result there is looking irrelevant as it is still raining at Edgbaston. Tears for the 2021 Champions. Raining at Old Trafford – I’m just going to have to excuse myself briefly to write something else – will pop back as soon as I can. Just as Essex did for Ryan ten Doeschate, so Kent do for Darren Stevens: Yorkshire keeping it tasty to the end – bowled out for 183 – seven runs short of Glouestershire’s first innings. Zafar Gohar 5-40, Yorkshire’s top-scorer Tom Kohler-Cadmore, 46. Harry Brook the gaping chasm in the batting line-up. Time for some lunch, back soon. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 149-0 v Somerset 202 Old Trafford: Lancashire 512 v Surrey 1-0 Wantage Road: Northants v Essex 220-8 no play before lunch Edgbaston: Warwicks 157-2 v Hampshire Headingley: Yorkshire 183 v Gloucestershire 190 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 146 v Leicestershire 249 Trent Bridge: Notts 402-3 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Glamorgan 346-6 New Road: Worcs 225 v Middlesex 59-1 And off they come – and lunch round the grounds. The players are out on the Old Trafford pitch, but so is the roller. One over from Tom Bailey in autumn sunshine. Keith Barker has his red socks on today, suggesting he means business, but 45 mins into play at Edgbaston and they’ve gone off for rain with no wickets having fallen since the delayed restart. In that time Warwickshire have progress to 157 for two from 52 overs, with the ball zipping about but Rob Yates looking as good as he did yesterday to move to 90 not out. Sam Hain is on seven at the other end, the only Bears batter past 1,000 runs this season. And as I write this, bright sunshine has broken out. Groundstaff are looking over yonder, however, and may wait a bit longer. There’s some more coming I fancy. Surrey will face one over before lunch. Ahhh, Balderson caught heading skywards in desperation, with just Parkinson left at the other end. Just three short of what would have been a maiden century. Lancashire 512 all out. Five for Moriarty in his first Championship run-out of the year.He actually has a touch of the Andrew Scott’s around the face. Glammy going for the batting points – collection in the hands of Andrew Salter and Chris Cooke. 314 for five. Runs, run, runs against a Durham bowling attack that looks tired. Notts 369-3 and laying down the guy ropes to bat all day. Nine, presumably glorious, fours. Is this going to bring a last-minute NatWest Final-esque nudge to the selectors? Kent 105-0 Oooh, could Yorkshire yet make this interesting at the bottom of Division One? Eight down for just 166, 24 short. But it is still raining at Edgbaston – WArwickshire unable to pull out their joker. Zafar Gohar 4-40. Jonathan Liew at his brilliant best: A bit slow off the mark here – thanks for the nudge BTL – but this is a touch of class by Kent, who are celebrating Darren Stevens in all his glory today at Canterbury. Stevens, who wasn’t available for selection after picking up a groin injury in the Royal London Cup victory at Trent Bridge, is at the ground today with family and friends and will be given a special presentation at lunchtime. There is also a special celebratory book in the Kent Cricket shop for Stevo fans to inscribe with their favourite memories of a 17-year career at the club. Tickets are reduced to £10 for adults, with kids and members free. If you find yourself with a spare hour or two on your hands at Canterbury – do pop down. Ali is on his way to Edgbaston, where the weather has relented and Rob Yates is on the search for run redemption – currently 77 not out. Events around the grounds not looking brilliant for Warwickshire – with Yorkshire only 49 runs away from parity at Headingley – though Zafar Gohar has grabbed both Kohler-Cadmore -for yet more pretty but insubstantial runs – and Duke for four. Yorks 141-5. Kent 46-0 chasing Somerset’s 202. A beauty from Moriarty – gets Hartley behind his legs. Lancs 467-7. Three for Moriarty and a career-best for Balderson, 81 not out. Raising a glass to the BBC cricket team: At Canterbury, Somerset are all out. Kent are batting – a test for the nerves. Zac Crawley, whose highest score for Kent this year is 84 and averages 24 – is being outscored by Tawanda Muyeye – who averages 20. Godspeed – a century each would do wonders to iron out a rotten season with the bat. This lad can play: It turns out my earlier stat was wrong – Jennings is the third Lancashire batter to be out for 199 after Wharton and Atherton. Damn you Jamie Overton and your lbw bullets. No000000000! So Frank Watson is the only other player in Championship history to have scored two doubles and a triple in one season. But did he have such lovely brown eyes as Jennings? Play delayed at Wantage Road till 10.45; and at Edgbaston till 11.15. With Keaton Jennings in the 191s, some stats, courtesy of Ken . No Lancastrian has ever been out in the 190s so I am totally safe to post this stat: If Jennings reaches 200 he will become only the second Lancastrian to score three double centuries in one season: 238 v Yorkshire at Headingley and 318 v Somerset at Southport. He is also the leading run scorer in the 2022 Championship with 1,224 runs in ten matches. The only Lancashire batter to have scored three double ‘tons’ in the same season is Frank Watson 94 years ago and that season Watson played in 32 matches/44 innings. Watson’s double centuries that year were:-223 v Northamptonshire (OT) May 1928; 300* v Surrey (OT) June 1928 and 236 Lancashire v Sussex (Hove) Aug 1928. I am shamelessly stealing this from the BBC blog – who have done the maths so I don’t have to. Thank you BBC. This is the state of play in the promotion/relegation battle: Division One: If Kent and Yorkshire draw, that will ensure they stay up after they grabbed three bonus points yesterday. 2021 Champions Warwicks need to hope that doesn’t happen, and thrash Hampshire. Division Two: Leaders Notts need only seven points to ensure promotion, Middlesex have the upper hand over Glamorgan, with a nine-point lead going into this round. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent v Somerset 195-9 Old Trafford: Lancashire 414-5 v Surrey Wantage Road: Northants v Essex 220-8 Edgbaston: Warwicks 138-2 v Hampshire Headingley: Yorkshire 80-3 v Gloucestershire 190 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 57-0 v Leicestershire 249 Trent Bridge: Notts 276-2 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Glamorgan 221-3 New Road: Worcs 167-8 v Middlesex Autumn shook out her shawl over the first day of the final round of County Championship fixtures, rain and bad light chasing the players. Warwickshire have to win and hope the other results fall in their favour to avoid becoming the first champions since Middlesex in 2016‑17 to go straight down the next year. Dom Sibley and Rob Yates both made half‑centuries against a Hampshire attack shorn of Kyle Abbott as Warwickshire ended the first day on 138-2. Nathan Gilchrist boosted Kent’s chances of survival with five wickets against Somerset, and will be on a hat-trick this morning after pricking the visitors’ revival. Lewis Goldsworthy, 93 not out, watched in dismay from the other end as Somerset fell to 195-9. Yorkshire, the other relegation candidates, were pepped up against Gloucestershire by the return of Matt Fisher, who grabbed four for 45 in his first game since April. Lancashire’s Keaton Jennings reeled off yet another century, this time against the county champions Surrey, at a deceptively sun-dappled Old Trafford. It was his fifth hundred of a happy summer. There were two wickets for Surrey’s Dan Moriarty, in his first game of the season. Tom Westley’s 55 propped up a faltering Essex against Northamptonshire, while Derbyshire’s Sam Conners grabbed five wickets against Leicestershire. Nottinghamshire, Division Two leaders and seeming certainties for promotion until they slipped up last week, had a good day against Durham. There were centuries for Haseeb Hameed, the fourth of his season, and Matthew Montgomery. Middlesex, chasing Notts’ coat-tails, reduced Worcestershire to 167 for eight, while third-placed Glamorgan, in with a sniff of promotion, made the most of a rain-shortened day against Sussex, racing along at more than five an over. India’s Shubman Gill finished unbeaten on 91. Hello!! A beautiful autumn morning in Manchester – hold on tight, these days will soon slip away. Only three days left of the 2022 Championship season as well – with things still very much up in the air. Weather elbowed into day one – but most games are well on their way. Lancashire compiling a ridiculous 414 thanks to Keaton Jennings; all the Division Two challengers on top – Middlesex, Glamorgan and Notts – while Kent and Warwicks also bang their drums. Only Yorkshire, of the relegation candidates, look in any bother – though they should be able to see off Gloucestershire’s attack at Headingley.

According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), the milestone was set at 12.30pm, with a contribution of 68.7%, or 18,882MW, from renewable sources. The figure is 4.6 percentage points higher than the previous record, which was set on 18 September. Of total power in the grid on Friday, 34% came from distributed solar, which outstripped black coal’s contribution of 22%. Renewable penetration rates are measured in 30-minute intervals, and illustrate contributions to the grid within a short period of time. “It’s very different to 100% renewables 24/7,” said Alison Reeve, climate change and energy deputy program director at the Grattan Institute. “Nevertheless, it does show how much the grid is changing.” “Five years ago the maximum that we’d managed to get to was 30%, and five years before that, I don’t know that anyone was even measuring [renewables], it was so small.” Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup One challenge of the energy transition was managing fluctuating contributions from renewable sources, Reeve said. “Once the solar has dropped out [at night], the percentage that you need to ramp up your non-renewables up to is a lot higher,” she said. “One of the things that is gradually driving particularly coal-fired power plants out of the market at the moment is that they can’t ramp up and down that quickly … they’re not good at switching on and off over a couple of hour periods.” Gas and hydro generators are more responsive at short timescales. Because of high gas prices currently, “when those gas generators come on they set quite a high price in the electricity market,” Reeve said. Hydro generators have recently been limited in their operation because of the wet weather on the east coast of Australia, she added. “They can’t send too much water down the river because they don’t want to make any flooding worse,” she said. Another challenge was replacing the “system’s stability” that coal and gas provide to the electricity grid – the ability to drop and raise generation slightly in order to “keep the voltage in the grid balanced”, Reeve said, which will require more long-duration storage infrastructure such as batteries. “Until we figure out a way to get that balancing role done by other things like pumped hydro and batteries, and we have enough of those in the system, there will be a natural upper limit on how much renewables penetration we have, particularly once you move beyond the instantaneous … and start to talk about what we can sustain over four or eight hours.” Reeve described these as “solvable problems”, but which required ironing out of details including costs, storage location and how the services would be valued. A July report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) found Australia was now among the world leaders in cheap solar energy. Behind China and India, in 2021 Australia had the third-lowest utility-scale solar cost in the world, of $0.042 USD/kWh (AU$0.065). This represented a 21% year-on-year drop in price. According to Irena data, the average cost of electricity from utility-scale solar has dropped by 90% in Australia since 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/14/alireza-akbari-grim-fate-seen-as-signal-from-irans-hardliners","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-14T15:48:01Z","webTitle":"Alireza Akbari’s grim fate seen as signal from Iran’s hardliners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/alireza-akbari-grim-fate-seen-as-signal-from-irans-hardliners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/14/alireza-akbari-grim-fate-seen-as-signal-from-irans-hardliners","fields":{"bodyText":"“I have to go.

Akbari, by now naturalised in the UK and a successful businessman, had been to a previous meeting a year earlier in the summer of 2018 in Karaj where he had been encouraged by the government to lead some blue-sky thinking on the future of the nuclear deal, and relations with the west. About 10 people attended with expertise from different fields. As a former deputy in the defence ministry and soldier in the Iran-Iraq war, his ability to analyse the west and synthesise thinking was highly prized. He thought he had the full protection of Shamkhani in leading these discussions. Many at the first meeting had said Iran could not survive western sanctions indefinitely, an analysis that did not find favour with some in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Certainly, Akbari’s reception on his second visit in 2019 was wholly different, with an intelligence office immediately assigned to him, and very rapidly he realised he had become the victim of a setup. The long path of interrogation in hotel rooms and security stations began. He appealed to Shamkhani to find out what was happening, and to call off the inquisition. Whether the Iranian intelligence services and Shamkhani genuinely believed he was a spy is up for debate. The conspiratorial mindset of some Iranian regime members towards the UK is deeply ingrained, based on 60 years of experience, and they were likely to be highly suspicious of any former regime member taking up exile with his family in a state deemed to be so hostile to the Islamic Revolution. The family claim he secured a visa legitimately and that innocent meetings with British estate agents and university admissions advisers became treacherous meetings with MI6 desk officers in the febrile imagination of the Iranian security services. The court papers detail how much he received from MI6, but his family say the Iranians have misconstrued income from his business as income from the British security services. The papers provide no tangible evidence about the actual bank accounts or the source of income so the judge seems to have taken the word of the security services without demanding the most basic evidence. The initial charge against him was conspiring with a foreign power, an offence that carried a maximum of 10 years in jail. But in 2021 the allegations became more serious, and Judge Abolqasem Salavati accepted the charge of corruption on Earth, a charge that carried the death penalty. By June of last year the family was so desperate that they thought it might be necessary to go public, but eventually decided the internal route of appealing against the verdicts was the safest. One of Akbari’s daughters decided to return to Tehran to work and her safety was a consideration. But the supreme national security council was given a chance to exonerate Akbari when it was asked a set of questions. The first was whether he had access to secret documents and had provided them to a foreign power, and if so would this be a threat to national security? It was also asked if the British government should be considered a “hostile government”? According to his family the council in response only emphasised that he had not cooperated with it since 2006, a neutral answer that was not enough to save him. Family members believe the intelligence services were under severe pressure due to their failure to protect Iranian nuclear scientists, and Akbari became useful to them in explaining that failure. Others see it as a signal from hardliners that there will be no compromise in the talks on the future of the nuclear deal, or in the treatment of the protesters. Akbari’s grim fate is a clear sign to anyone advocating for the deal, or a continued relationship with the west, they will be regarded by some as walking on treacherous ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"Beam me down: can solar power from space help solve our energy needs?

Their job is to decide the next priorities for the European Space Agency (Esa), of which the UK is still a member, and one of the items on their list to consider is a proposal for testing the feasibility of building commercial power stations in orbit. These huge satellites would bask in the sunlight, converting it to power and beaming it down to Earth to be fed into the power grid. The proposed project, known as Solaris, would determine whether the idea can contribute to Europe’s future energy security – or if it is all still pie in the sky. If the study gets the go-ahead, it will be like coming home for the space industry, which has always been at the forefront of solar power development. A year after the Russians launched the battery-powered Sputnik 1 in 1957, the Americans launched Vanguard 1. This was the fourth satellite in orbit and the first to generate its power using solar energy. Since that time, solar panels have become the primary way of powering spacecraft, which has helped to drive research. Vanguard 1’s solar cells converted just 9% of the captured sunlight into electricity. Today, the efficiency has more than doubled, and continues to increase, while the cost of fabrication has been falling. It’s a winning formula. “The cost of solar has been decreasing rapidly over the past 20 years, and faster than most players in the industry expected,” says Jochen Latz, a partner at management consultant McKinsey &amp; Company. So much so, that in the Middle East and Australia, solar power is now the cheapest way to generate electricity. According to Latz, as the technology continues to develop, this will become true in the mid-latitude countries too. “In 2050, we expect more than 40% of the energy in the EU to come from solar power – if the countries achieve their committed targets,” says Latz. That would make solar power the single largest contributing energy source to the EU. However, there are obvious problems that need solutions if we are to fully utilise solar panels on Earth. For one thing, what do we do at night? In May, Ned Ekins-Daukes, associate professor at the school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and his team of researchers demonstrated a solar cell that could generate electricity from the emission of infrared rather than from the absorption of sunlight. This works perfectly at night because the Earth stores energy from the sun in the form of heat, which it then radiates back into space as infrared radiation. The prototype device is based on the same kind of technology used in night-vision goggles and at present it can only generate a few milliwatts of power, but Ekins-Daukes sees the potential. “This is the beginning – it’s the world’s first demonstration of thermal radiative power,” he says, indicating that the team is aiming for a finished product that is “10,000 times more powerful”. At those levels, it is possible that a rooftop installation of such devices, probably fabricated in some way as an additional layer to conventional solar panels, would capture enough energy to power the house overnight – that is, keeping the fridge, wifi router and so on running. While that is a modest saving for each household, multiplied across a country’s population, it becomes significant. Another obvious issue with solar power is that some days will be cloudy. To alleviate this, excess electricity generated on sunny days needs to be stored in batteries but storage capacity is currently woeful. “The EU will need about 200 gigawatts [GW] of battery storage by 2030, but as of 2021 there was only 2.4GW of storage in place, so a massive increase will be needed,” says Aidan McClean, chief executive of UFODrive, an all-electric car rental company. To help with this shortfall, McClean champions a scheme called vehicle-to-grid – V2G – which uses the battery in an electric vehicle (EV) to store excess energy generated by a home’s rooftop solar panels and then transfer it back into the house when needed in the evening, or even sell it on to National Grid at other periods of high demand. “If V2G becomes widely adopted, the expected storage capacity of all the EVs will vastly exceed any expected storage requirements the grid will require going into the future,” says McClean. A recent V2G trial in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, showed that participants saved money and cut their carbon footprint by using an “intelligent” charging system that topped up the batteries when renewables were generating electricity. Another approach is to use solar power not to generate electricity but to produce sustainable vehicle fuels. Virgil Andrei of the department of chemistry at Cambridge University and his colleagues have developed a thin “artificial leaf” that draws its inspiration from photosynthesis. In plants, photosynthesis takes in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and converts them into oxygen and sugars. In the artificial leaves, the output is syngas, or synthetic gas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used to produce a number of fuels via various industrial processes. It is even possible to produce petrol and kerosene. “We envisioned using CO2 from the atmosphere or other industrial processes and pouring that into these types of systems to create green fuel. Instead of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere, we just have a circular carbon economy,” says Andrei. In effect they would piggyback off carbon-capture plants, which are currently being deployed to harness CO2 from industrial processes, and “recycle” it into sustainable fuels. The team first made an artificial leaf in 2019 but it was a bulky construction of glass and metal that sat on a bench top. This year, however, the team announced the results of a smaller, actual leaf-like structure that the researchers floated on the River Cam. The leaf was sealed inside a transparent plastic bag with the precursor gas and water and then left on the river for a number of days. The team then opened the bag and tested what gases had been produced by photosynthesis. The artificial leaves themselves are composed of materials called perovskites. The archetypal perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral of calcium titanium oxide – also known as calcium titanate – which was discovered in 1839 in the Ural mountains of Russia by German mineralogist Gustav Rose and named after his Russian counterpart Lev Perovski. Modern perovskites can have different chemical constituents and some have shown that they can function as solar cells. “These materials are very new and very exciting,” says Andrei. Laboratory tests show that they can be more efficient than the silicon used in conventional solar panels. Perovskites could even replace silicon in the solar panels of the future as they can be fabricated more easily and in thin, flexible layers. Another bonus is that these materials produce higher currents and voltages than their silicon counterparts, which allows more energetic processes such as the reactions that were used in the artificial leaves study. *** As promising as all this sounds, though, there is one insurmountable problem when generating solar power from the surface of the Earth: the atmosphere. The molecules in our atmosphere scatter about half the sunlight out of the direct beam. This scattered light bouncing around is what creates the blue sky we are so familiar with. In space, there is no atmosphere, so the sun’s light is undiluted. And as the aerospace engineers at the beginning of the space race found, put a solar panel in orbit and it will automatically generate about twice as much power as the equivalent panel on Earth. Unsurprisingly then, engineers and visionaries have been dreaming of putting solar power-producing satellites into orbit for decades. The basic principle is simple. A fleet of spacecraft with giant solar panels collects sunlight, before converting it into power and then beaming that energy back to Earth. How do you wirelessly beam energy across space? It turns out we’ve been doing it for decades. Every telecommunications satellite since the 1960s has used a solar panel to generate electricity, which is then converted into a microwave signal and sent to Earth. On the ground, antennas convert the microwaves back into electrical energy and read the signals. “The physics involved in that whole chain is exactly the same for space-based solar power, but the scale of it is completely different,” says Sanjay Vijendran of Esa, who is coordinating the proposed Solaris programme to study the feasibility of space-based solar power. Every few decades since the beginning of the space race, the idea of space solar power has been investigated. On every occasion, the story has been the same: the cost of launching such large satellites is prohibitive. But now, things are different. “In 2015, a miracle happens. The Falcon 9 reusable rocket flies for the first time,” says John Mankins, a former Nasa physicist who is now president of Artemis Innovation Management Solutions. Mankins is an expert on solar-power satellites, having worked on many of the feasibility studies over the decades. With the advent of a truly reusable rocket, the cost of sending equipment into orbit is tumbling. Instead of costing about $1,000 to launch every kilogram into space, Mankins now expects the price to come down to closer to $300 a kilogram. “That’s the holy grail for space solar power. It is not just possible some day – it’s inevitable in the next five or seven years,” he says. Others are similarly optimistic. In September 2021, the Frazer-Nash Consultancy published a report for the UK government that concluded: “Space solar power is technically feasible, affordable, and could both bring substantial economic benefits for the UK, and could support net zero pathways.” In late August, Esa released its own studies on space-based solar energy, which arrived at a similar conclusion for the whole of Europe. As a result, the agency will request in November that its member states fund a three-year feasibility study into solar-power satellites to examine in detail whether such a system might become commercially viable. “Solaris is a bridge to check that this is really doable and that it would really help before we ask for billions of euros,” says Vijendran. Whether or not such satellites go into orbit, there can be no doubt that solar power is set to dominate the energy landscape of the future. And as the current Ukraine crisis shows, that could lead to better energy security as well as reducing our carbon output."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/21/ukraine-evacuations-kherson-mykolaiv-regions-winter-war-damage-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T19:17:31Z","webTitle":"Ukraine to begin evacuations in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions as winter sets in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/21/ukraine-evacuations-kherson-mykolaiv-regions-winter-war-damage-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/21/ukraine-evacuations-kherson-mykolaiv-regions-winter-war-damage-infrastructure","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. With the Kremlin sending fresh reinforcements to the area, as well as troops previously deployed in the south, the Russian armed forces and the Wagner mercenary group have begun intensifying efforts to break that long and bloody stalemate, with unconfirmed reports of the use of incendiary munitions against Ukrainian positions. Russia has been pounding Ukraine’s power grid and other infrastructure from the air, causing widespread blackouts and leaving millions of Ukrainians without heat, power or water as frigid cold and snow blankets the capital, Kyiv, and other cities. Four-hour or longer power outages were expected in 15 Ukrainian regions on Monday, according to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of the state grid operator, Ukrenergo. More than 40% of Ukraine’s energy facilities were damaged by Russian missile strikes in recent weeks. While the situation in the recently liberated areas of the south led to the evacuations announcement, it is barely better in many other parts of the country. The situation in Kyiv and other major cities has deteriorated drastically after the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrenergo said 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties because of damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across Ukraine. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, it added: “Resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has also stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout. “Worst-case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we [do not] have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” he said on Friday. Ukrenergo said: “Thousands of kilometres of key high-voltage lines are not working,” affecting the entire country. News of the evacuations came as a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had caused widespread damage, but concluded that there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns at the Russian-held facility. “They were able to confirm that – despite the severity of the shelling – key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns,” the UN agency said in a statement. Repeated shelling of the Zaporizhzhia complex has raised concerns about a grave accident 310 miles (500km) from the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times. It has six Soviet-designed water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing uranium-235. The reactors are shut down but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power driving the cooling systems is cut. Heavy fighting continues in Kherson city, where there were a series of explosions on Monday, with one person killed and four others were taken to hospital as a result of shelling, according to the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Russia’s forces continue to strengthen defences along the east bank of the Dnipro River and to build up additional defensive lines deep inside Russian-held territory. “Artillery duels continue, the fight continues,” said Dmytro Pletentchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military in the area. “Kherson is now on the frontline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-25T14:27:28Z","webTitle":"Ministers close to deal that could end China’s role in UK nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers are closing in on a deal that could kick China off a project to build a £20bn nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast and pump in tens of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash instead – a move that would heighten geopolitical tensions. The government could announce plans to take a stake in Sizewell C power station, alongside the French state-backed power giant EDF, as early as next month, ahead of the Cop26 climate summit. That would be likely to result in China General Nuclear (CGN), which currently has a 20% stake in Sizewell, being removed from the project. It risks inflaming political tensions, which are running high after Britain’s decision to join the Aukus nuclear submarine pact with the US and Australia – a move designed to counteract China’s military expansion. CGN, the power giant backed by the communist state, is also bankrolling EDF’s Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Washington has been leaning heavily on Westminster to remove China from Britain’s nuclear power plans, blacklisting CGN, citing fears over national security and accusing it of stealing military technology – claims it denies. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last year urged Britain to choose sides in the battle to develop nuclear technology, saying it “stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have”. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&amp;G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (RAB), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on RAB funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month. EDF’s board is due to hold a meeting in November to discuss pushing Sizewell forward but is understood to be wary about pumping tens of millions into the project without firm commitment from Westminster. EDF has been lobbying intensively for a RAB mechanism, arguing that it could slash the “strike price” – the guaranteed price for Sizewell’s electricity – to between £30 and £60 per megawatt hour. Hinkley’s £92.50 MWh strike price has been criticised as excessive at a time when offshore wind costs are falling. All but one of Britain’s eight existing nuclear power stations, which provide up to 20% of its electricity, are due to close by the end of the decade, resulting in a huge gap in low-carbon power generation. The global gas crunch and soaring energy bills have cranked up the pressure on ministers to act, and ministers are keen to announce a deal on Sizewell next month, ahead of November’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to be pushing the Treasury for a large slice of spending on nuclear power in the 27 October spending review. Kicking China off Sizewell would effectively tear up the government’s 2015 deal with CGN, under which it agreed to fund Hinkley and Sizewell, and then install its own reactors at a third site at Bradwell in Essex. The chances of CGN getting approval to build its reactor in Britain are seen as slender. That deal was seen as the pinnacle of the “golden era” between Britain and China. Pressure to remove China has ratcheted up under Joe Biden’s administration, with executives from the US construction giant Bechtel teaming up with Westinghouse, the US nuclear technology company owned by Canada’s Brookfield, to develop another nuclear power station, at Wylfa on Anglesey. In their pitch to the government, they said the project would strengthen the “special relationship”. “Through a successful partnership at Wylfa, the UK and US will share a common interest in promoting the use of this secure, reliable technology in new markets to compete against state-backed Russian and Chinese options,” they wrote. Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, said: “CGN’s motivation in supporting the Hinkley Point and Sizewell projects was to secure a chance to build its own reactor design at Bradwell. With Bradwell now off the table it’s unlikely they would be interested in the Sizewell investment. “CGN may still persist with approving its reactor design with the UK authorities to secure that gold standard accreditation, but this is where its UK nuclear ambitions are likely to end,” he said. CGN and EDF declined to comment. The business department said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play as we work to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global gas prices. “CGN is currently a shareholder in Sizewell C up until the point of the government’s final investment decision. Negotiations are ongoing and no final decision has been taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/25/power-bills-to-rise-by-up-to-a-quarter-in-parts-of-australia-after-regulator-issues-market-default-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T01:50:11Z","webTitle":"Electricity prices to rise by up to a quarter in parts of Australia after energy regulator issues market default decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/25/power-bills-to-rise-by-up-to-a-quarter-in-parts-of-australia-after-regulator-issues-market-default-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/25/power-bills-to-rise-by-up-to-a-quarter-in-parts-of-australia-after-regulator-issues-market-default-decision","fields":{"bodyText":"Electricity prices will rise by up to a quarter in July in some states after the Australian Energy Regulator issued its decision on the default market offers that set the baseline for retailers. But the AER says this is about the half the hike that might have happened without government intervention. The offers, which cover New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland, indicate prices will rise between 19.6% and 24.9% for residents, similar to the draft levels announced in March. Victoria also announced a 25% rise to its default offer. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Clare Savage, AER’s chair, told ABC radio that the increases could have reached 50% without the federal imposition of price caps on gas and black coal last December that helped lower the wholesale component of electricity prices. For NSW, residential customers without controlled load will see price increases of 20.8% to 21.4%, the regulator said, noting the rise exceeded the forecast inflation rate by as much 15.1 percentage points. Those with controlled load will see price increases of 19.6% to 24.9%. Residential customers in south-east Queensland face increases of about 21.5% for customers without controlled load and 20.5% for customers with controlled loads. Those in South Australia without controlled load will see price rises of about 23.9%, or slightly more than the 22.5% for those with controlled load. Small business owners will be spared some of the worst of the rises, with those in NSW covered by Ausgrid to see prices jump 14.7% while those plugged into SA power 28.9%. Residents with controlled load have separately metered tariffs used for appliances such as electric hot water storage systems, pool pumps or underfloor heating. The changes don’t affect feed-in tariffs paid to owners of solar panels who export excess power to the grid, whose payments depend on their retailer. The regulator said the default market offers provide “an electricity price safety net that protects consumers from unjustifiably high prices” and apply to household and small business customers on standard retail plans. Wholesale energy costs, which account for about a third to half of final bills, continue to be “the predominant driver of increased retail electricity prices”, the AER said. State and federal bill relief measures will take some of the sting out of the increases. “We know households and small businesses continue to face cost-of-living pressures on many fronts, and that’s why it’s important the DMO provides a safety net for those who might not have shopped around for a better power deal,” Savage said. “In setting the DMO price this year we have sought to protect consumers from unjustifiably high prices and at the same time allow retailers to offer consumers better deals than their standard plans.” The Albanese government, which came to office promising household power prices would fall by $275 on average by 2025, said the AER had forecast increased tariffs of 40-50% late last year. “In the longer term, we are getting more renewables in the grid through Rewiring the Nation and the Capacity Investment Scheme, because the cheapest form of energy is firmed renewable energy – and this will take pressure off bills and help shield Australians from volatile international energy prices,” Chris Bowen, the minister for climate change and energy, said in a statement. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, noted the Coalition had hid the power price increases last year by ordering the regulator to delay the announcement until after the election. “It’s clear that our energy intervention has been successful in easing power price rises,” Chalmers said. The Energy Consumers Australia’s interim chief executive, Jacqueline Crawshaw, said the higher default offers followed double-digit increases in the current year and were “another blow for consumers”. Crawshaw said the federal budget’s energy bill relief package would counter the shock for millions of eligible households and small businesses but it was clear consumers needed additional support. For Victorians, the higher offer adds $352 to the average residential power bill and $752 for small business customers. The final reading was $74-$126 less than proposed in the Essential Services Commission’s draft decision. Marcus Crudden, an executive director at the ESC, said the trimmed increase was because of thinner retail margins, lower final network tariffs from the AER and changes to the wholesale electricity allowance. “Stakeholders did raise deep concerns about the retail energy margin at the time of the draft, so we’ve reduced it from 5.7 to 5.3%, taking about $10 off the bill,” he said, adding that he expected prices had peaked. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said 1.4 million Victorians had applied for the power saving bonus, with 40% receiving a better deal. “[Energy companies] don’t ring you to tell you you’re paying too much. You’ve got to ... make sure you’ve got the best deal,” he told reporters in Dandenong.

The home secretary said a statutory instrument to the public order bill, which passed its final stages in parliament on Wednesday, would stop what she described as the “selfish disruptive protesters [who] are wreaking havoc in people’s everyday lives across the country”. Just Stop Oil’s supporters have carried out slow marches on busy roads in the capital every day this week, as it renews its campaign after climate rallies in Westminster by Extinction Rebellion last weekend. The group, which calls on the government to stop licensing new oil and gas projects, adopted the tactic at the end of last year, after supporters racked up long lists of arrests and charges for a series of dramatic and disruptive protests. Police were forced to weigh the disruption of the marches against the protesters’ rights to political speech. A change to the definition of “serious disruption” would empower police to intervene when protesters used the tactic, the Home Office said. “This will give police the clarity they have asked for on when to use their existing powers to break up the slow marching tactics protesters have used to halt traffic across the UK,” it said. On Friday morning, 64 Just Stop Oil supporters marched from locations in Ealing, Putney and Mile End, the campaign said. According to the Metropolitan police, in each case protesters moved out of the road after 45 minutes to an hour when officers enforced orders requiring them to only protest on the pavement. In Mile End, a man was escorted from the scene by police after snatching banners from activists and dumping them by the side of the road, MailOnline reported. Just Stop Oil denounced the government’s move. “We won’t be deterred by changes to protest laws or how strongly the police enforce those laws,” a spokesperson said. “Just Stop Oil supporters understand that this is irrelevant when we face mass starvation, mass death and the collapse of ordered human society.” Richard Clark, 49, a Just Stop Oil supporter from Cornwall, said: “The government and their paymasters are engaged in a genocidal attack on the young and those least responsible for climate breakdown around the world. I will support those fighting our corrupt and wanton system, even risking my own freedom and livelihood as a teacher.” The public order bill will create a number of new protest offences and grant police a number of new powers over demonstrations. A new criminal offence of interfering with key national infrastructure carries a 12-month potential sentence. Protesters who lock themselves together, or to objects or buildings, could face six months in jail. Police will have new powers to stop and search protesters they believe are setting out to cause “serious disruption”. A new kind of court order will allow the authorities to ban people involved in protest groups from being in certain places at certain times, from being with particular people, or from using the internet in certain ways. The UN’s high commissioner for human rights this week called on the UK to “reverse this legislation as soon as feasible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/14/turkey-syria-earthquake-misinformation-relief-efforts-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"False social media posts are hindering earthquake relief efforts in Turkey.

The caption says it is, incredibly, footage of a nuclear power plant in Turkey exploding after the earthquake that ravaged the country. Except Turkey doesn’t have any operational nuclear power plants. The footage actually shows a fertiliser storage facility in the port of Beirut, Lebanon, exploding in 2020. This video is just one of countless posts spreading on social media, falsely claiming to depict catastrophic events in Turkey. Ever since, factcheckers across the world, including Full Fact, have been trying to verify real events, to limit the spread of misleading and dangerous misinformation. Factcheckers on the ground are especially stretched – last Tuesday, our counterparts based in Turkey, Teyit, got in touch to ask for support in stemming the tide of misinformation. Syrian factcheckers, Verify-sy, told us they have had to mostly stop their work due to the damage to their homes. With the death toll now climbing to more than 33,000 people, it’s crucial that those working on the relief efforts have access to good information online. False information can directly hinder aid and disaster relief. People and organisations may be using footage they see online to help identify those affected, or reunite people with missing family members. As far back as 2017, the Canadian Red Cross was trying to educate people about the reliance of victims of a disaster on any information they can find. Misleading content online can prevent those trying to help people getting the right information and support. And for the people affected by this tragedy, the last thing they need to see is their social media feeds clogged with misinformation. Victims don’t deserve to have their traumatic experiences exploited just for the sake of shares, whether well-intentioned or not. In addition, some of these accounts are directly asking for viewers to donate funds, allegedly for the relief effort. Given the inauthenticity of the content being posted, it’s possible they are deliberately exploiting events for personal financial gain. Legitimate fundraising operations such as the Disasters Emergency Committee have now raised more than £50m – it’s important that bad actors are prevented from trying to capitalise on the fact that so many people want to help. It’s understandable that people want to share footage of the tragedy, and more often than not, this is done in good faith. But when we see highly emotive breaking news stories take over our social media feeds, it creates an opportunity for misinformation to thrive. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, we saw a similar story emerge. It wasn’t long before clips from previous wars, different countries and even video games were being shared across the internet, used to falsely illustrate the war. We even had to fact check the BBC after it used footage of an old Russian military parade that we had debunked the day before. When this sort of tragic event happens, some people unfortunately want to find ways in which they can benefit from the widespread attention to the topic. In our monitoring of online content at Full Fact, we’ve seen accounts set up seemingly with the intention of just gaining influence by posting fake clips of the tragedy. It’s hard to stop the people who appear to be sharing this kind of misinformation for money or fame. But we know that most of them are not malicious, bad actors seeking to exploit a tragedy. They are simply people looking to find and share information in the wake of an upsetting event. And in situations like this, we all have a role to play. When you see a video regarding the earthquake, the first thing to ask yourself is: does this seem plausible? The video claiming it showed a nuclear power plant exploding could be debunked with a quick Google search. Ask yourself if anything in the footage seems obviously out of place? A video we’ve seen claiming to show a tremor in Turkey was actually from Nepal. How do we know this? The cars pictured have Nepalese, not Turkish, number plates. With so much work being done by factcheckers worldwide, it’s also worth checking if the video you’re watching has been debunked already. And if you’re still unsure, we have a toolkit for spotting misinformation online that anyone can access. At times of such tragedy, we can all come together and play our part by being just a little more careful about what we share online. When bad information spreads, it can ruin lives, and in this instance, it can risk hindering the relief effort during a continuing disaster.

But this nondescript home in Narrabundah is the registered address for “Aukus Jobs”, a recruitment firm with a web domain that was secured two days after Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine plans were first announced. The government has argued the hi-tech multi-decade partnership with the US and the UK will create as many as 20,000 jobs in Australia. But the first result for anyone searching for Aukus jobs on Google is the recruitment platform using the same name. Aukus Jobs promises to make “the skills, experience and aspirations of jobseekers and students instantly findable for employment and upskilling opportunities within the Australian defence industry”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Web domain records indicate the website was registered on 18 September 2021 Canberra time – two days after the term Aukus was made public when Joe Biden, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson unveiled the three-country “forever partnership”. The company’s ABN was registered on 20 September 2021. Guardian Australia does not suggest that the business claims to be officially connected with the Aukus program; only that questions are raised by the use of the name and the timing of its launch. The Australian government, for its part, has distanced itself from the company. When asked whether it had any concerns about the use of Aukus in the name, a Defence spokesperson said: “Aukus Jobs has no affiliation with the Australian Department of Defence or the commonwealth government.” The chief executive officer of Aukus Jobs, Mark Korsten, has previously held roles in maritime security and more recently in professional services. He offered a general response to questions on Thursday. “Aukus Jobs is not a government entity, and has never pretended to be,” Korsten said. “Aukus Jobs is a commercially available skills matching platform that has been purpose-built to assist the Australian defence industry (and those of our Aukus partners if they choose) to find, upskill and mobilise defence-relevant skills, experience and aspirations more efficiently and effectively.” Korsten is no stranger to the defence establishment, having served in the Royal Australian Navy until 2007. For two years he was a surveillance operations officer at the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency based in Honiara, Solomon Islands, according to his LinkedIn profile. Korsten, who has a bachelor of engineering in naval architecture, states he has worked as the manager of the Pacific Maritime Security Program at the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service in the early 2010s. His profile notes he has undertaken a number of consulting roles, including capability development planning for the Qatar coastguard and maritime security adviser for the Republic of Djibouti. More recently Korsten held roles with Jacobs Australia, a professional services company that has a long history of providing services to the Department of Defence. Jacobs is listed as a partner on the Aukus Jobs website. Korsten did not respond to specific questions about Aukus Jobs, including whether anyone had asked him to consider renaming it and how many jobseekers or clients it has. But he said his business aimed to respond to the fact that most players in the Australian defence industry used “outdated talent acquisition processes that are grossly inefficient and ineffective”. “This costs the Australian defence industry hundreds of thousands of hours per year in lost productivity, and (ultimately) the Australian taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars when the costs are passed to the government,” Korsten said. “This inefficiency also undermines the capability and availability of the equipment our military personnel rely on. This would not be a problem if we were talking about baristas; however, inefficiency in mobilising our available defence industry skills and experience is one of the biggest weaknesses in Australia’s national security framework.” Korsten said his company took “a genuinely novel approach by encoding a skills family for the entire Australian defence industry; allowing jobseekers to mathematically encode their unique professional DNA; allowing employers to mathematically encode their ideal candidate; and making connections within seconds”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/apr/11/late-night-recap-colbert-documents-leak","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-11T15:02:34Z","webTitle":"Colbert on US documents leak: ‘Big time yikes for the executive branch’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/11/late-night-recap-colbert-documents-leak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/apr/11/late-night-recap-colbert-documents-leak","fields":{"bodyText":"Stephen Colbert Returning to the Late Show after an Easter break, Stephen Colbert examined two government scandals from the weekend. First, the leak of classified US intelligence documents, which first appeared on a Discord server weeks ago. According to one investigator, “this shit was sitting in a Minecraft Discord server for a month and no one noticed”. “So national secrets were on a video game chat?” Colbert marveled. “Turns out the nuclear launch codes were up up, down down, right, B, A, start.” To make matters weirder, the leaked documents were not uploaded. Rather, photos were posted of crumpled documents, as if they’d been hastily folded up and shoved into a pocket. “That’s it? The technology was ‘put in pocket’?” Colbert wondered. “The movies make stealing national secrets look so much harder. Get ready for the new Tom Cruise movie, Mission Impossible – Wait, I Just Shoved It in My Pants.” The leak was a “big time yikes for the executive branch”, he continued, but also, the “judiciary is a disaster right now” after ProPublica reported that the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas secretly accepted luxury trips worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a billionaire GOP donor, Harlan Crow. “Wow, I can’t believe Clarence Thomas did something inappropriate, said a woolly mammoth after being reanimated from the Siberian permafrost,” Colbert deadpanned. The trips happened virtually every year for more than two decades, and included trips around the world on Crow’s superyacht and flying on his private jet. Thomas claims he was advised by colleagues that “this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the court, was not reportable”. “Adding, ‘Now I gotta get back on deck before we lose that golden hour sun. #yachtlife #somelikeityacht,’” Colbert joked. Thomas also said the gifts didn’t count because of his personal relationship with Crow extending back 25 years. “OK, but you’ve been on the court for 31 years,” Colbert noted, which could still make the friendship count as a bribe. “OK, I’ll bite. So he’s your close personal friend that you know everything about,” Colbert continued, “so I guess it would be really embarrassing to learn that Harlan Crow has a collection of Adolf Hitler artifacts and Nazi memorabilia”, including two paintings by Hitler and linens embroidered with swastikas. “Ladies, take note: that is a red flag,” said Colbert. “You never want to have to tell your gal pals, ‘So, I finally spent the night at Todd’s … it was good but he’s got this really intense gaming set-up and two paintings by Hitler. Should I text him back?’” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped an unhinged Easter post from Donald Trump. Posting in all caps on Truth Social, the former president wished a “Happy Easter to all, including those that dream endlessly of destroying our country because they are incapable of dreaming of anything else” among other campaign messages about the wall, socialists, Marxists and communists. “What a warm and lovely man he is,” Kimmel deadpanned. “Instead of license plates in jail, they should have him write greeting cards. I think that would be a better use of his gifts. “At this point, Donald Trump’s brain is basically a bowl of microwaved Peeps.” Kimmel also reported a Melania sighting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the holiday. “Poor Melania. Imagine after everything he put her through last week, and then he wakes her up on Easter and says, ‘I need you to come downstairs and eat an omelet on camera with me today,’” said Kimmel. Trump also filed a last-minute appeal to block Mike Pence from testifying before a grand jury about his conversations with Trump on January 6, even though Pence himself did not try to appeal that order. “I don’t know, maybe Trump should just pay Mike Pence $130,000 to keep his mouth shut,” Kimmel joked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/24/agl-to-close-torrens-b-island-gas-fired-power-station-south-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T01:31:56Z","webTitle":"AGL to close South Australia’s main gas power station, citing new grid link and cheaper renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/24/agl-to-close-torrens-b-island-gas-fired-power-station-south-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/24/agl-to-close-torrens-b-island-gas-fired-power-station-south-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"AGL Energy will close its main gas-fired power station in South Australia by 2026, citing the completion of a new grid link to NSW that will give the state more access to low-cost renewable energy. The energy giant, which has been under siege from billionaire activist Mike Cannon-Brookes over its decarbonisation pace, told the ASX on Thursday it would close the remaining three units of the 600 megawatt Torrens Island B gas-fired power station on 30 June 2026. The closure plan was driven “in part” by the construction of a new transmission line between NSW and SA that is due to begin operating by mid-2026, AGL said. The decision was not influenced by the recent expansion of the company’s board to add four members proposed by Cannon-Brookes. Discussions between AGL and the SA government have been going on for some time. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Energy Market Operator had listed Torrens B as operating until 2035, but an accelerated closure date had been expected. AGL mothballed one of the plant’s four units last year and the remaining three will have operated for 50 years by the time of the station’s new intended closure date. The rise of renewables in the state played a role in the decision. During the day time in SA, wind and solar commonly meet most or all of the state’s electricity demand. Rooftop solar panels alone were providing more than four-fifths of the supply by mid-afternoon, the OpenNEM website showed. The ageing Torrens B plant was less capable of firing up and shutting down to meet the market’s fluctuating needs. AGL’s 210MW Barker Inlet gas-fired station, completed in 2019, is better able to cope with supply demands. However, recent orders by Aemo for AGL to turn on the Torrens B plant to meet the need for synchronicity and supply demonstrated its ongoing usefulness. An AGL spokesperson said it is common for two of the plants units to be operated at minimum levels of output to provide stability to the grid. It is “very rare” to have them dispatched any more than that. AGL received stern opposition from the Turnbull government in 2015 went it gave seven years’ notice of closing its 1680MW coal-fired power station in the NSW Hunter Valley. It extended the scheduled shutdown by a year to April 2023, just after the March state elections. In the Torrens B case, AGL has given the required 42 months’ notice of plans to close the gas plant. The company has not said whether it will extend the plant’s life if the NSW-SA transmission line, known as Project Energy Connect, is delayed. Debate over energy prices has flared in the past month after the Albanese government’s first budget forecast that electricity prices could rise as much as 56% over two years from last June. The extent of rises so far will be revealed next Wednesday, when the Australian Energy Regulator is scheduled to release its annual retail markets report. About 100 employees will be affected by the Torrens B decision. In its statement, AGL said it was “strongly committed to working with its people, unions and the government” to assist the transition to a low-carbon future for the energy system. Investors were little moved by the news, with AGL’s shares down about 1% in late afternoon trade. The overall market was up about 0.1%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/15/iran-urged-to-take-revenge-on-uk-after-british-iranian-spy-executed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-15T22:35:01Z","webTitle":"Iranian hardliners urge revenge on UK after Alireza Akbari’s execution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/15/iran-urged-to-take-revenge-on-uk-after-british-iranian-spy-executed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/15/iran-urged-to-take-revenge-on-uk-after-british-iranian-spy-executed","fields":{"bodyText":"Iranian hardliners are urging their government to exact revenge on the UK and deliver a blow to its spying network by revealing the true names of the British intelligence agents who supposedly worked with Alireza Akbari, the British-Iranian dual national who was executed on Saturday for allegedly spying for the UK. The call – made by Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor of the Kayan, the newspaper closest to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) – shows hardliners are intent on a confrontation with Britain over the issue. Akbari’s devastated family deny he was a spy and insist he is the victim of an internal power struggle within the regime. The former British ambassador to Tehran, Richard Dalton, has suggested Akbari’s execution, condemned by world leaders as barbaric, may be a warning to the UK not to go ahead with plans to proscribe the IRGC. The Labour party backed proscription for the first time on Sunday, saying the move is justified by “the growing threat that the IRGC poses on UK soil, as well as in response to the crackdown on protests, the unjust imprisonment of British nationals in Iran, the execution of Alireza Akbari, longstanding concerns about Iran’s threats to Israel, and its support for violent groups across the region”. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is travelling to Washington this week, where he will seek to coordinate a response to Akbari’s execution and the wider security threat posed by Iran. So far he has recalled the UK ambassador to Tehran for consultations and sanctioned the Iranian prosecutor general. Shariatmadari wrote: “Now it is our turn to take revenge, and it is expected that the Ministry of Information will provide some information related to the leads, commanders, and agents of the British and Mossad intelligence services who were involved in technical interrogations and publish the expert knowledge obtained.” This move, if undertaken quickly, he said, “would be a terrible blow to the body of the British spy system and its foreign intelligence and espionage department, MI6”. Shariatmadari added: “There are also questions about how this spy infiltrated the sensitive and strategic centres of the system, which should not be simply ignored.” With Iran gripped by gas shortages and power cuts in freezing temperatures, there were also calls for a deepening of its security and energy relationships with Russia. The US has already proscribed the IRGC, and some US Republicans are becoming exasperated with the failure of European nations to follow suit. Claudia Tenney, a member of the US Congress foreign affairs committee, tweeted on Saturday: “Iran’s execution of British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari is yet another act of barbarism from this brutal regime. Enough empty statements of condemnation from European capitals. The time is now for action – full sanctions, especially on the IRGC &amp; all senior regime officials.” The policy difficulty for Europeans is that the IRGC is already sanctioned and evidential thresholds have to be met before the IRGC can be proscribed as a terrorist organisation. But the calls for a broader strategic reappraisal of the west’s approach to Iran are growing after the continued daily repression of protests and the impasse in nuclear talks. More than 60 French senators have officially requested that the EU close Iranian banks in Europe and ban the passage of Iran Air planes from European skies, as well as abandon the nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) completely. At the same time, 100 MEPs have asked for the IRGC to be designated a terrorist entity, in a call due to be debated by the European parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Antagonism towards Iran has also grown due to the Iranian supply of drones to Russia that have been used in Ukraine. A senior Iranian parliamentarian said on Sunday that the alliance with Russia would be deepening, with the supply of Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets early in the next Iranian year, which starts in March. Shahriar Heydari, a member of the Islamic Republic’s parliamentary commission for national security and foreign policy, did not specify the number of aircraft ordered. Opinion appears more divided in European capitals about the wisdom of formally ending the already stalled talks on the nuclear deal, with some ministers concerned that a dangerous vacuum would be filled by Iranian hardliners that would then speed up its uranium enrichment programme or pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The outgoing chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Aviv Kochavi, said on Sunday that economic sanctions and a military option involving more than Israel might yet convince Tehran to suspend its nuclear military programme, as it did in 2003. “The best strategy now would be to further intensify the economic sanctions on Iran, to build up a military option not only of Israel. Then maybe the total of these pressures would bring them to a situation as in 2003, when they decided to suspend the military aspect of the nuclear programme,” he said. “Basically, it would be worth reaching a new agreement that’s better – not reasonable and not good, but better, one that neutralises some of the flaws of the previous agreement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/oct/06/damien-power-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T16:30:13Z","webTitle":"Damien Power: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/06/damien-power-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/oct/06/damien-power-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet","fields":{"bodyText":"Hello.

I hope this brings you joy. 1. Jack Bensinger Jack Bensinger has one of the most original sketch comedy accounts on the internet. Completely off the wall and brilliant. 2. Saint Hoax This account is a welcome, accidental discovery I made recently. It isn’t always super funny, but it is a wonderful blend of social commentary and memes. Truly the highest form of meme art on the internet. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning 3. Dan Rath Dan Rath is the best stand up in Australia at the moment. Obviously, that is not to disregard the many legends that exist, but I just think Rathy will be a legend of Australian comedy in the future. It’s the character, writing and his relationship with the audience. 4. Greg Larsen on cream Greg Larsen is an old friend of mine and we’ve worked together in comedy for about 10 years. He truly doesn’t like to be told what to do in comedy and follows what he believes is funny at all costs. This sketch about cream basically sums up what to expect. 5. Aaron Gocs Aaron Gocs is a truly unique voice in Australian comedy, adored by comedians and fans alike. I think the best way to consume Gocsy is to follow him and take in his presence all across the internet. He’s the king of the comments section and his take on every day life is unique. 6. Becky Lucas I love Becky Lucas’s jokes. They’re not off the wall or absurd, just really great jokes that are well delivered. I always make sure I watch Becky live. Maybe I’m biased because we started together in Brisbane, but I love that she now has a big following. 7. Conner O’Malley’s Endorphin Port Check out Conner O’Malley in general, but particularly this. It pretty much gives you a taste of what he’s about. This guy is a true original. 8. Ol’ Dirty Bastard interview on MTV This was an interview ODB did where they could not get a single line that was usable. It’s hilarious. He doesn’t say anything that makes sense and they have to retake it over and over. It’s always been one of my favourite things. 9. Cringe TikTok I’ve become obsessed with “cringe TikTok”. This Instagram account documents what is, in my opinion, the greatest art of a generation. I probably spend my time on this account more than any other. It’s filled with just embarrassing narcissistic performances. Truly wonderful and a sign of the end of a civilisation. 10.

The comments by the chief executive of the Bank’s regulatory arm, Sam Woods, come a day after his boss and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said that reforms to so-called Solvency II regulations would increase the possibility of life insurance firms failing by 20% in a given year. Firms like Aviva and Legal &amp; General claim the reforms will release hundreds of billions of pounds for big investments like infrastructure projects, by reducing the amount of capital they have to hold to prove they can pay policyholders in the long term. The Treasury and BoE have disagreed over the potential risks of Solvency II reforms, which the Conservative government hopes will accelerate the levelling up agenda across the UK. Woods told MPs on Tuesday that the government was offering the Bank “additional powers” to oversee the insurance sector, including additional stress testing – which measures how firms would fare during a severe market downturn – and requiring senior managers to personally vouch for the fact that the firm is holding enough capital against risks on their balance sheets. However, Woods said it did not make up for increased risks the planned reforms pose. “The government has committed … to give us some additional powers to help us manage risks in the insurance sector,” Woods told the Treasury select committee, adding: “What I would say though, is that we do not think we either should, or can, use those to achieve the same effect, as we were looking for through a reform of the fundamentals.” However, Woods told the committee he did not feel strongly enough about the risks to suggest that MPs vote against Solvency II changes, and was at no point considering resigning from his post over the issue. MPs also pushed Woods over plans to reform the UK ring-fencing regime, which was introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and forces banks to separate, and protect, customer deposits from their investment banking activities. Some lenders argue that the rules are no longer necessary, because other regulations are in place to ensure the banks themselves could afford to go bust in an orderly way, without relying on taxpayer bailouts that would ultimately protect customers and the wider economy. Woods said that while he welcomed some reforms, scrapping ringfencing entirely could put taxpayer money at risk. The committee also asked whether the Bank was concerned over the potential impact of the climate crisis on the mortgage market, including cases where lenders may refuse to offer home loans in areas at a greater risk of flooding due to more extreme weather events. Woods speculated that the government could be forced to intervene in a similar way to the cladding crisis. “We’ve had a live example of this quite recently with cladding … where a lot of people are kind of trapped. “If the effect of climate change or other things meant that you had parts of the country, that as a matter of wider government policy, we want to be inhabited but which could not get funding for from banks, or could not get insured, then I think that would be a question for the government to look into,” he said. Woods’ comments came as another senior Bank official warned that UK companies could be exploiting the cost of living crisis to push through inflation-busting price increases – a phenomenon widely known as “greedflation”. Catherine Mann, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee, told Bloomberg in an interview published on Tuesday she was concerned about the ability of firms to take advantage of consumer willingness to tolerate higher prices. Her comments reflect growing anxiety about the risk posed by corporate greedflation – although she did not use the specific word.

Cars have evolved, and technology has accelerated to create a captivating driving experience. Fast pick-up. Smooth acceleration. But can you have the best of both worlds: a car that can take you from quick off the lights to a smooth, energy-efficient experience on the open road, without any range anxiety? Thanks to the two-speed hybrid gearbox, yes, you can. What is a two-speed hybrid gearbox? When hybrid vehicles first hit the Australian market, they came with single-gear transmissions. That meant, at any given moment, either the electric motor or the petrol engine was sending power to the wheels, but not both. Drivers could switch between the two modes according to the kind of driving they were doing. Later, switching between modes became automatic, but the single-gear transmissions still had their limitations. While the electric motors in these hybrids could generate sufficient torque to provide the great acceleration – and excitement behind the wheel – for which these cars have become famous, their flexibility was limited. The 2022 Haval H6 HEV For zipping around town, life was good: the stop-start of city traffic is ideal for an electric motor. But on the freeway, switching to the petrol engine meant all that exciting torque dropped. The driving experience was compromised. A two-speed hybrid gearbox offers the best of both worlds. Instead of a petrol engine and electric motor operating independently of one another, it becomes a combined effort: each one can send power to the wheels simultaneously. As a result, the car can achieve higher torque, faster acceleration and improved energy quality compared to earlier hybrid models. A two-speed hybrid gearbox can adjust to what you need at every speed. A two-speed hybrid transmission helps your car perform at its best Steve Maciver is head of marketing and communications at GWM Haval, home to the Ultra Hybrid range with its 7-in-1 smart hybrid system – and two-speed transmission. He says these are versatile, efficient cars that can adapt to different kinds of driving. Australian drivers drive in lots of different conditions, taking vehicles through heavy traffic, along country roads, through extreme weather and lengthy commutes. In most cars, those conditions determine fuel and battery consumption, but can’t change the way the car operates. “Under normal driving conditions, a vehicle will be subject to a wide variety of different loads and operating conditions,” Maciver says. With a two-speed hybrid gearbox, like the one found in the Ultra Hybrids, the system can measure load and operating conditions, and switch to a more efficient mode. “GWM’s hybrid system measures multiple inputs from engine and driver to determine the best operating mode,” Maciver says, “and automatically switches for the best efficiency and driveability, without the need for any specific action from the driver.” What does it all mean for the drive? At low speeds, a two-speed hybrid can run on pure electric for maximum efficiency. At high speeds, a lower gear ratio kicks in, with petrol engine and electric motor running in tandem to provide fuel efficiency as low as 5 litres per 100km, compared to the average of 11.1 litres per 100km for standard petrol vehicles. Sending power to the wheels from both engine and motor can generate more torque than either on its own, so drivers still get the punchy pick-up of an electric. The overall experience is sporty and smooth; exciting and reliable; more torque and less petrol. For Maciver, the benefits are clear: “This leaves the driver free to enjoy the drive with the confidence that the best fuel efficiency and performance is being delivered.” To experience the Ultra Hybrid range for yourself, book a test drive or get in touch with your local dealer to learn more."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-25000-have-fled-kherson-moscow-says-west-denounces-kremlin-dirty-bomb-claim","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T18:01:05Z","webTitle":"No indication Russia has decided to use nuclear weapon in Ukraine, says senior US official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-25000-have-fled-kherson-moscow-says-west-denounces-kremlin-dirty-bomb-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-25000-have-fled-kherson-moscow-says-west-denounces-kremlin-dirty-bomb-claim","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s grip on the city of Kherson appeared increasingly fragile after a weekend in which all civilians were ordered to evacuate immediately in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said the urgent call indicated that the occupiers “do not expect a rapid Russian or civilian return” to the city, and appeared to be trying to depopulate it to damage its “long-term social and economic viability”. All men remaining in Kherson have been invited to join a newly formed local militia. In a notice on Telegram, the occupation authorities said men had the “opportunity” to join territorial defence units if they chose to remain in Kherson of their own free will. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva conventions. The head of Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate said Russia was bringing new military units into Kherson as it prepares to defend the city in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Kyrylo Budanov also said Russia would slow Ukrainian troops’ advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhova hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. The United Nations has said urgent steps are needed to relieve a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea. Ukraine said Russian inspections that have been creating “significant” delays for the export of Ukrainian food products were “politically motivated” and a cause for concern. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow had asked the UN for data on the destination and end-consumers for Ukrainian grain exports, saying that “corrections” to the agreement would depend on this information. The United States has no indications that Russia has made any decision to use a nuclear weapon, biological weapon or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. The US believes Russia is “keeping lines of communication open” after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added. Ukraine and the US denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address. The White House national security council also rejected Shoigu’s claims. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” a statement said. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has asked the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, to send experts to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities to disprove Russian claims that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell welcomed Ukraine’s decision to request an expert mission from the UN’s nuclear watchdog to examine its facilities. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said he spoke with the US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and his British counterpart Ben Wallace about Russia’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The alliance rejects Moscow’s claims, he said, warning that Russia “must not use it as a pretext for escalation” in its war in Ukraine. Russia’s military chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov held calls with Britain’s chief of defence staff Tony Radakin and the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley on Monday. The Russian defence ministry said Radakin and his British and American counterparts discussed the possibility, raised by Moscow without providing any evidence, that Ukraine might use a “dirty bomb”. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Israel has condemned Russia’s invasion and has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well. Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic revolutionary guard corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. Ukraine faces power outages after Russian strikes target energy facilities. Russian airstrikes on energy infastructure across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said at the weekend. Rebuilding Ukraine will be a “task for a generation” that no country, donor or international institution can manage alone, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Scholz said it was important to repair destroyed energy plants and networks but also to make them more efficient, to ultimately allow an expansion of Ukrainian electricity exports to the EU and a step-by-step transition to climate neutrality. An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians believe the country should keep up its armed resistance to Russia’s invasion, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) took place after two weeks of heavy Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. It showed 86% said it was necessary to continue fighting even if missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities persist. A pro-Kremlin television presenter has been accused of inciting genocide after calling for Ukrainian children to be “drowned” and “burned” alive during an interview on the state-funded RT channel. Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, was suspended from RT, and the head of Russia’s powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation. US basketball star Brittney Griner “does not expect miracles” at her appeal hearing on Tuesday, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling. Her lawyers said she would take part in Tuesday’s hearing by video link from the detention centre where she has been held, and that they expected a verdict the same day. US basketball star Brittney Griner “does not expect miracles” at her appeal hearing tomorrow, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling. Griner pleaded guilty at her trial but said she had made an “honest mistake” and had not meant to break the law. Griner’s lawyers said she would take part in Tuesday’s hearing by video link from the detention centre where she has been held, and that they expected a verdict the same day, Reuters reports. They said: She is very nervous waiting for the appeal hearing. Brittney does not expect any miracles to happen but hopes that the appeal court will hear the arguments of the defence and reduce the term. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has spoken with the US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and his British counterpart Ben Wallace about Russia’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The alliance rejects Moscow’s claims, he said, warning that Russia “must not use it as a pretext for escalation” in its war in Ukraine. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has welcomed Ukraine’s decision to request an expert mission from the UN’s nuclear watchdog to examine its facilities over Russian claims that it is developing a “dirty bomb”. Borell said he had spoken with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the Russian claims, which he described as false. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Zelenskiy said in a video speech to a conference for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: Isn’t it time for your state to choose who you are with as well? Is it with the democratic world, which is fighting side by side against the existential threat to its existence? Or with those who turn a blind eye to Russian terror, even when the cost of continued terror is the complete destruction of global security. Israel has refused to sell air defence weapons to Kyiv, wary of straining relations with Moscow despite reports that Iran is providing support for Russian pilots flying Iranian-made drones to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine. Moscow has denied its use of the Iranian drones against Ukrainian cities, but Tehran officials have confirmed it and said they will also supply ballistic missiles to help replenished Russia’s dwindling armoury. Israel has condemned Russia’s invasion and has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Speaking today, Preisident Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well. The United States has no indications that Russia has made any decision to use a nuclear weapon, biological weapon or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. From Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch: An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians believe the country should keep up its armed resistance to Russia’s invasion, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) took place after two weeks of heavy Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. It showed 86% said it was necessary to continue fighting even if missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities persist. The proportion of people backing continued armed resistance remained high, at 69%, even in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions which have seen more fighting and are home to larger numbers of Russian speakers. The results of the survey showed Russia’s shelling of Ukrainian cities had achieved the opposite of its intended aim “to sow panic, despair and force Ukrainians to surrender”, the deputy director of KIIS Anton Hrushetskyi said. He added: Yes, the terror continues, people die or are injured, Ukrainian families are forced to spend their evenings in the dark. However, the national pain from losses and destruction does not frighten people. The Ukrainian people maintain strong unity and stability and are ready to continue the struggle to victory. Russia’s military chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov has spoken with Britain’s chief of defence staff Tony Radakin and the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley today. The Russian defence ministry said Radakin and his British counterpart discussed the possibility, raised by Moscow without providing any evidence, that Ukraine might use a “dirty bomb”. Radakin rejected Russia’s allegations that Ukraine is planning actions to escalate the conflict during the call, the British defence ministry said in a statement. An MoD spokesperson added: The military leaders both agreed on the importance of maintaining open channels of communication between the UK and Russia to manage the risk of miscalculation and to facilitate de-escalation. The conversation followed the defence secretary’s call with his Russian counterpart yesterday and a call between the foreign ministers of France, the UK, and the USA last night. Shortly after, Radakin had a similar conversation with Milley. Rebuilding Ukraine will be a “task for a generation” that no country, donor or international institution can manage alone, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Speaking at a German-Ukrainian business forum, Scholz pointed to the EU’s decision in June to make Ukraine a candidate to join the bloc. He said: This decision also sends a signal to private investors: anyone who invests in rebuilding Ukraine today is investing in a future EU member country that will be part of our legal community and our single market. Scholz said it was important to repair destroyed energy plants and networks but also to make them more efficient, to ultimately allow an expansion of Ukrainian electricity exports to the EU and a step-by-step transition to climate neutrality. He stressed the need for more transparency and “an even more determined fight against corruption” as Ukraine strives ultimately to join the bloc. Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal told the forum that rebuilding will be a forward-looking process. A pro-Kremlin television presenter has been accused of inciting genocide after calling for Ukrainian children to be “drowned” and “burned” alive during an interview on the state-funded RT channel. Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, said Ukrainian children who said they were being occupied by Russia should be “thrown in a river with a strong undercurrent”. “They should have been drowned in the Tysyna [river],” said Krasovsky during an interview with the fantasy writer Sergei Lukyanenko. Just drown these children. Drown them. Russian state media has previously hosted commentators who have denied the existence of Ukrainian culture or called for the country’s total annexation by Russia. But even in the era of Russian wartime propaganda, where it appears that anything goes, Krasovsky’s remarks have provoked a backlash. On Monday, he was suspended from RT, and the head of Russia’s powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s defence ministry said its troops have liberated more than 90 settlements in the Kherson region from the Russians. It said in a post on Telegram: In the Kherson region, the Southern Defense Forces liberated more than 90 settlements that are home to more than 12,000 people live. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has accused Russia of only communicating with the world in the language of “blackmail”. Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” are another example of this use of blackmail, Podolyak said on Twitter. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, held talks today with Pope Francis, with the war in Ukraine expected to have been their main topic of discussion. The Vatican said the conversation lasted 55 minutes but, as is customary, did not specify what they discussed. It said Ukraine, in particular its humanitarian situation, topped the agenda in later talks Macron had with the Vatican’s two top diplomats. It’s 4pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson.

Kyrylo Budanov also said Russia would slow Ukrainian troops’ advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhova hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson. A former chief of the British army has said Russia faces an “inevitable defeat” in Kherson ahead of an expected battle. Gen Lord Dannatt claimed Vladimir Putin’s troops are attempting to save face to make their defeat appear “less chaotic”. Dannatt also suggested Russia was targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as they were “still on the back foot” on the battlefield. Concern is also growing that Russia may blow up a large hydroelectric dam at Nova Kakhovka, upstream from Kherson, which holds back 18m cubic metres of water. On Friday, Ukrainian defence intelligence warned that the dam had been mined and that two trucks full of explosives had been placed on top of its 30m-high walls. The US has rejected as “transparently false” Russia’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory as part of an escalation of Vladimir Putin’s war. Secretary of state Antony Blinken told his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Sunday “the world would see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacted swiftly to Moscow’s claims, calling for a united international response. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said in a video address on social media. His foreign minister Kuleba denounced Moscow’s claims as “absurd” and “dangerous”. Russia continues to use Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), otherwise known as drones, against targets throughout Ukraine, though Ukrainian efforts to defeat the Shahed-136 UAVs are increasingly successful, the UK Ministry of Defence has determined. Official sources, including Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy, claim that up to 85% of attacks are being intercepted, according to the latest British intelligence report. The head of Russia’s nuclear, chemical, and biological forces has said Moscow has “readied all forces and capabilities to fulfil tasks in conditions of radioactive contamination”, Max Seddon from the Financial Times writes. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. With Russian troops setting up new defences for a fresh Ukrainian offensive in Luhansk in the country’s east as well, Moscow appears to be preparing the ground for yet further escalation, with discredited claims that Kyiv may be preparing to use a dirty bomb as a “false-flag operation” to blame Russia. Russian officials – including Vladimir Putin – have repeatedly hinted that the Kremlin may be prepared to use a nuclear weapon as part of its so-far failed brinkmanship to discourage Kyiv and its western allies, which have been supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, intelligence and training. Shoigu discussed the “rapidly deteriorating situation” in phone calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts and also spoke by phone with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he “rejected any pretext for Russian escalation”. Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a “dirty bomb” – conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Read the full story here: The United Nations has said urgent steps are needed to relieve a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea. The comments by Ismini Palla, a UN spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative, come as Ukraine accused Russia of blocking the full implementation of the agreement. The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey to facilitate Ukrainian grain shipments that it had blocked since the start of its war with Ukraine, comes up for renewal next month. Russia has threatened to pull out, claiming that the deal is not directing grain to the world’s poorest countries. Vessels carrying grains and other foodstuffs to and from Ukrainian ports must be inspected by teams organised by the four-party Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) at anchorages in Turkey. Palla said: There are currently over 150 vessels waiting around Istanbul to move and these delays have the potential to cause disruptions to the supply chain and port operations. Ukraine said Russian inspections that have been creating “significant” delays for the export of Ukrainian food products were “politically motivated” and a cause for concern. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement: We have reason to believe delays in Russia’s inspections of the grain initiative*s vessels are politically motivated. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had asked the UN for data on the destination and end-consumers for Ukrainian grain exports, saying that “corrections” to the agreement would depend on this information. Speaking at a press briefing broadcast on state television, Lavrov said: This is not just curiosity. The correction or redirection of further actions to implement the grain deal depend on it. Romania’s defence minister, Vasile Dîncu, has announced his resignation, weeks after he said Ukraine’s only chance to end the war was to negotiate with Russia. Dîncu said in a statement: My gesture (resignation) comes as it is impossible to cooperate with the Romanian president, the army’s commander-in-chief. He added: I think my withdrawal from the post is necessary so as to not harm decisions and programmes which require fluid command chains and to not block a series of projects which are absolutely necessary for … the ministry and the army. Dîncu had come under fierce criticism for suggesting that Ukraine needed international allies to negotiate security guarantees and peace with Russia. He later said his comments were taken out of context. President Klaus Iohannis said Ukrainians were paying with blood in the war and only they could decide what and when to negotiate, a position held by Romania and the EU. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said only Russia would use nuclear weapons in Europe, following evidence-free allegations by the Russian defence minister that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory. Zelenskiy pointed out that Russia was using “nuclear blackmail” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, “phosphorus munitions” and “banned anti-personnel mines against civilian infrastructure’”. He said Russia was preparing to use the very weapon it was accusing Ukraine of holding. The US and UK have dismissed Russia’s claims, with the British defence ministry cautioning against using such allegations to escalate the conflict. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has asked the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, to send experts to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities to disprove Russian claims that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief had agreed to “urgently send experts to peaceful facilities in Ukraine”, he said. During his regular briefing with reporters today, the Kremlin’s Dmitry Peskov reiterated the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory as part of an escalation of the war. Peskov said: Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn’t mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn’t exist. Such a threat exists, and the defense minister has given the information about it to his interlocutors. It’s up to them whether to trust it or not. The Kremlin has claimed France and Germany have shown “no desire” to participate in mediation on Ukraine, while praising an offer by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to organise talks. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, have shown “no desire to listen to Russia’s position or participate in mediation efforts”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added: Ankara takes a different position from that of Paris and Berlin … and has declared its readiness to continue mediation efforts. Here’s more from that interview with Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate, who said Russia was bringing new military units into Kherson as it prepares to defend the city in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Orders from the occupied city’s Russian administration for residents to evacuate are part of an “information operation and manipulation” by Moscow, Budanov told Ukrainska Pravda. He said: They are taking out cash, [internet] servers, the so-called occupation authorities … All the non-walking, seriously injured are being taken out, they are trying to discharge those who can walk as soon as possible from hospitals. They conduct this crazy information campaign that ‘we care about people’ and so on. They create the illusion that everything is gone. At the same time, on the contrary, they bring new military units there and prepare the streets of the city for defence. Budanov said Moscow was acting out of fear that Ukrainian troops might retake the Kakhovka dam, upstream from Kherson, and encircle its troops in the city. He added: They understand that if we take at least control over the Kakhovka dam, which is the only transport artery that is fully functioning now, they will have to make a decision very quickly. Either very, very quickly leave the city and get out, or they risk ending up in the same situation that our units in Mariupol found themselves in earlier. He concluded by saying: Understanding all this, they are preparing the groundwork so that, if necessary, they can get out of there very quickly. However, they are not preparing to exit now, they are preparing to defend. Russia would slow Ukrainian troops’ advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhova hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military spy chief. The comments by Kyrylo Budanov come amid growing concern that Russia is planning to blow up the large hydroelectric dam at Nova Kakhovka, upstream from Kherson, which holds back 18m cubic metres of water. Such a move would flood Russian-occupied territory and deprive Moscow of a vital water canal for annexed Crimea, Budanov said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda. On Friday, Ukrainian defence intelligence warned that the dam had been mined and that two trucks full of explosives had been placed on top of its 30m-high walls. But Budanov, head of Ukraine’s defence ministry’s main intelligence directorate, said the dam had been only partially mined and that destroying it completely would require many tonnes of explosives. Russian forces would get “a total flooding” of the Russian-occupied left bank of Kherson, he said. He added: They will lose even theoretically the possibility of supplying water to the North Crimean Canal, to Crimea … He continued: Of course, they would complicate our advance for a certain period of time. And this, by the way, is not a very long period of time, around two weeks or thereabouts. He added that blowing up the dam would also “destroy the possibility of the existence of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant because this facility is inextricably linked to it”. It’s just past 1.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s grip on the city of Kherson appeared increasingly fragile after a weekend in which all civilians were ordered to evacuate immediately in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive.

A Russian fighter jet crashed in Siberia, killing two crew members. The Su-30 fighter jet came down on a private, two-storey building housing two families in Irkutsk, a major industrial centre in eastern Siberia. The crash appears to reflect the growing strain that the fighting in Ukraine has put on the Russian air force. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Zaina Alibhai to bring you all the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The United Nations has said more needs to be done to clear a backlog of grain exports in the Black Sea. It’s claimed there are more than 150 ships waiting around Istanbul, with the delays potentially causing disruption to supply chains and port operations. The export deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in summer, allowed Ukraine to resume exporting grain from ports in the Black Sea that had been shut down amid Russia’s invasion. Ukraine said seven vessels carrying grain had sailed from its ports on Sunday but accused Russia of blocking them. A Russian TV presenter has apologised for claiming children who opposed Russia should be drowned in a river. The Russia Today anchor Anton Krasovsky said he was “really embarrassed” after getting “carried away” with his comments. “Well, it happens. You’re on air, you get carried away, and you can’t stop. I ask for the forgiveness of everyone who was stunned by this,” he said. The state broadcaster suspended Krasovsky shortly after his remarks, and suggested the incident was a result of “temporary insanity”. Yet it appears he crossed the line, with Russia’s state investigative committee confirming it was looking into and would produce a report on the matter. The presenter’s comments came last week in a broadcast in which he was responding to an account by the science fiction author Sergei Lukyanenko about his first visit to Ukraine in the 1980s during which children told him they would live better lives were it not for Russian occupiers. “They should have been drowned in the Tysyna. Just drown those children, drown them,” he said. A former chief of the British army has said Russia faces an “inevitable defeat” in Kherson ahead of an expected battle. Residents in the Russian-occupied region have been urged to leave, with all men who choose to stay behind being asked to join a newly formed militia. Gen Lord Dannatt has claimed Vladimir Putin’s troops are attempting to save face to make their defeat appear “less chaotic”. “The Russians are obviously thinking about trying to turn what is probably an inevitable defeat there into some kind of managed withdrawal to make it appear less chaotic from their point of view,” he told Sky News. Dannatt suggested Russia was targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as they were “still on the back foot” on the battlefield. A leading Iranian general accused of supplying drones to Russia has reportedly mocked the European Union over sanctions. Maj-Gen Mohammad Bagheri has suggested the bloc “buy coal” for its citizens to warm their houses this winter, amid rising energy prices caused by the war. Bagheri was among three Iranian military officials sanctioned recently by the UK and European Union after claims of Iranian drones being used in attacks against Ukraine. “They are allowed to identify and confiscate all the properties and assets of Maj-Gen Mohammad Hossein Bagheri in banks around the world and use them to buy coal for European citizens, a difficult winter is ahead,” he is reported to have said. The chief of staff of the armed forces also described the sanctions a “mistake” similar to those the US made when it sanctioned him in 2019. Russia Today has been accused of inciting genocide after a presenter claimed children who criticised the Kremlin should be drowned. The state-controlled broadcaster last week suspended anchor Anton Krasovsky within hours of his comments, insisting nobody at RT shared his views. Its editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, has since suggested the “wild and disgusting” remarks from Krasovsky – a pro-war commentator who has been sanctioned by the European Union – were a result of “temporary insanity”. Ukraine has called for a worldwide ban on RT, urging countries who had not yet done so to watch Krazovsky’s segment. “Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it) which has nothing to do with freedom of speech,” foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said. Men in the Russian-occupied region of Kherson have been invited to join a newly formed local militia. Russian authorities have been urging residents to leave the city, fearing an attack from Ukrainian troops, and claim 25,000 residents have left since Tuesday. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed last month, and is key to both sides due to its proximity to the Dnieper River. Russia continues to use Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), otherwise known as drones, against targets throughout Ukraine, though Ukrainian efforts to defeat the Shahed-136 UAVs are increasingly successful, the UK Ministry of Defence has determined. Official sources, including Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy, claim that up to 85% of attacks are being intercepted, according to the latest British intelligence report. Russia has urged more civilians in occupied Kherson to leave amid an exodus to escape an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russian authorities told residents to take “documents, money, valuables and clothes” due to “the tense situation on the front” and reported on Sunday that there had been a sharp increase in the number of civilians trying to leave. About 25,000 people have been “evacuated” since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. Russia’s grip on Kherson appears increasingly fragile. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said the urgent call to leave indicated that the occupiers “do not expect a rapid Russian or civilian return” to the city, and appeared to be trying to depopulate it to damage its “long-term social and economic viability”. One person was killed by a homemade bomb in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Sunday, according to Russia-installed authorities in the region. “An improvised explosive device, attached to a street pole and detonated remotely, killed a civilian from Kherson,” local pro-Russian official Kirill Stremousov wrote on social media, adding that a passerby had been wounded, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of planning to blow up the Nova Kakhovka dam. Breaching it could flood a swathe of southern Ukraine, including Kherson. Ukraine and the US denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address. The White House national security council also rejected Shoigu’s claims. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” a statement said. A Russian fighter jet crashed in Siberia, killing two crew members. The Su-30 fighter jet came down on a private, two-storey building housing two families in Irkutsk, a major industrial centre in eastern Siberia. The crash appears to reflect the growing strain that the fighting in Ukraine has put on the Russian air force. Ukraine said seven vessels sailed off from its ports on Sunday carrying grain bound for Asia and Europe, but accused Russia of blocking the full implementation of Black Sea grain deal. French president Emmanuel Macron said it’s up to Ukraine to decide the time and terms of peace with Russia, and cautioned that the end of war “can’t be the consecration of the law of the strongest.” “To stay neutral would mean accepting the world order of the strongest, and I don’t agree with this,” Macron said at the opening of a three-day peace conference in Rome on Sunday. Ukraine faces power outages after Russian strikes target energy facilities. Russian airstrikes on energy infastructure across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said at the weekend. A German lobby group representing companies with interests in eastern Europe has called for a plan to rebuild Ukraine that would mirror the Marshall plan that helped Europe recover from the second world war, the media group RND reported. A Ukraine-Germany business forum in Berlin on Monday will discuss the plan set to be attended by German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian prime minister Denys Schmyhal. The Guardian’s Daniel Boffey spoke with one of the women freed in last week’s prisoner swap. It was like something from the cold war. After five months in the most notorious jail in occupied Ukraine, Alina Panina, 25, had found herself, without explanation, at the foot of a bridge over a river in no man’s land with 107 fellow female Ukrainian prisoners of war. Behind Panina lay Russian-occupied territory and her experiences of the siege of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the subsequent surrender and then captivity in Olenivka prison in Donetsk. There she was witness to the aftermath of an explosion that killed 53 male prisoners, a blast said by Kyiv to have been engineered by Moscow to silence the victims of torture. Read the full story below: Ukraine said seven vessels sailed off from its ports on Sunday carrying grain bound for Asia and Europe, but accused Russia of blocking the full implementation of Black Sea grain deal. Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry said in a statement posted to Telegram on Sunday: Russia is deliberately blocking the full realisation of the Grain Initiative. As a result, these (Ukrainian) ports in the last few days are working only at 25-30% of their capacity.” The UN-backed agreement paved the way for Ukraine to resume grain exports from Black Sea ports that had been shut since Russia invaded. Moscow won guarantees for its own grain and fertiliser exports. Ukraine called for the renewal of the deal but concerns over whether Russia will agree to an extension beyond the 19 November deadline has intensified after Russia has repeatedly raised complaints about its implementation. Some recent images to come through our newswires today show the situation currently unfolding in Ukraine. Ukraine is facing more power outages after Russian strikes continue to target energy facilities. Russian airstrikes on energy infrastructure across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said at the weekend. Zelenskiy has urged Ukrainians to conserve energy. We should consume electricity very consciously. Please remember to limit the use of unnecessary and energy-consuming appliances,” he said in his latest national address on Sunday night. It is necessary to be really frugal with energy consumption in public space.” Spanish authorities moved a luxury yacht linked to the sanctioned head of Russian defence group Rostec after the shipyard where it was berthed stopped receiving payments for its repairs, a transport ministry source told Reuters news agency. The 85-metre (279ft) long yacht, that Spain has said is worth $140m, was transferred to a marina last month, the source and other officials said, highlighting the logistical challenges authorities have faced managing vessels being held across Europe because of sanctions imposed over Russia’s military actions in Ukraine. Spain ordered the ship Valerie “frozen” – meaning the vessel can not be used or sold – in March, saying it was acting on European Union sanctions. The yacht is tied to Sergei Chemezov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a police source and another source with knowledge of the matter said. The Valerie is now moored in the nearby Marina Vela marina and its name has been changed to the Meridian A, Reuters documentation checks and pictures of the vessel show. The yacht is formally owned by Chemezov’s stepdaughter, Anastasia Ignatova, according to the European Union’s sanctions list to which she was added in April. Its immobilisation was unsuccessfully challenged in Spanish courts in March by Sulberg Services Limited, a company registered as the yacht’s owner in the Equasis shipping database. Sulberg argued that Spanish authorities could not prove who owned the yacht and could therefore not freeze it. A Madrid court rejected the claim in April. A German lobby group representing companies with interests in eastern Europe has called for a plan to rebuild Ukraine that would mirror the Marshall plan that helped Europe recover from the second world war, the media group RND reported. A Ukraine-Germany business forum in Berlin on Monday will discuss the plan set to be attended by German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian prime minister Denys Schmyhal.

Ukraine and the US have denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu made the allegation about a dirty bomb in a round of telephone conversations with western defence chiefs. In those calls, Shoigu conveyed “concerns about possible provocations by Ukraine with the use of a ‘dirty bomb,’” the Russian defence ministry said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday sharply dismissed the claim that Kyiv was preparing to use a dirty bomb. If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken rejected Shoigu’s “transparently false” allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory and that the world would “see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation” in a statement issued by the White House. A statement from US national security council spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson said, “We reject reports of minister Shoigu’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.” A so-called dirty bomb is designed to contaminate a wide area with radioactive material, making it dangerous for civilians. It does not involve a nuclear explosion. Russia continues to use Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), otherwise known as drones, against targets throughout Ukraine, though Ukrainian efforts to defeat the Shahed-136 UAVs are increasingly successful, the UK Ministry of Defence has determined. Official sources, including Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy, claim that up to 85% of attacks are being intercepted, according to the latest British intelligence report. The full report reads: These UAVs are slow, noisy and fly at low altitudes, making lone aircraft easy to target conventional air defences. Russia is likely expending a high number of Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs in order to penetrate increasingly effective Ukrainian air defences. It is likely using them as a substitute for Russian-manufactured long-range precision weapons which are becoming increasingly scarce.” Here are a few more images we have received through the newswires today of civilians leaving the Russian-occupied Kherson region. Russian authorities in the occupied territory of Kherson continue to urge residents to leave fearing an anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive in the region. Since Tuesday, about 25,000 people have been “evacuated”, the Russian-installed deputy head of the region Kirill Stremousov claimed. “We again recommend you to leave the city and the western bank of the Dnipro,” Stremousov said in a video message published on Telegram. “We are not going to give up Kherson.” The occupied city’s Russian administration told residents to take “documents, money, valuables and clothes” due to “the tense situation on the front” and reported on Sunday that there had been “a sharp increase” in the number of civilians trying to leave. Russian-installed officials in Ukraine’s south are trying to “evacuate” up to 60,000 people living on the western bank of the Dnipro River. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours.

Since Tuesday, about 25,000 people have been “evacuated”, the Russian-installed deputy head of the region Kirill Stremousov claimed. The US, UK and France have rejected Russia’s latest claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory as“transparently false” and just part of an escalation of Putin’s war.

Iran has said it will supply Russia with 40 turbines to help its gas industry amid western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, local media reported. Iran’s “industrial successes are not limited to the fields of missiles and drones”, Iranian Gas Engineering and Development Company’s CEO, Reza Noushadi, was quoted as saying by Shana, the oil ministry’s news agency on Sunday. Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic revolutionary guard corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. Russia fired missiles and drones into Ukrainian-held Mykolaiv on Sunday, destroying an apartment block. Mykolaiv lies roughly 35 km (22 miles) northwest of the frontline to occupied Kherson UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, rebutted claims made by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Ukraine, facilitated by western counties including UK, was planning to escalate the conflict. “The defence secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement after talks between the UK and Russia. French president Emmanuel Macron said it’s up to Ukraine to decide the time and terms of peace with Russia, and cautioned that the end of war “can’t be the consecration of the law of the strongest.” “To stay neutral would mean accepting the world order of the strongest, and I don’t agree with this,” Macron said at the opening of a three-day peace conference in Rome on Sunday.

Sir Stephen Lovegrove, 55, said that the erosion of backdoor channels had resulted in an increased chance of an accidental escalation into war. In a speech in Washington at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, he said he believed the deterioration of communication with China and Russia had created a higher risk of “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”. “The cold war’s two monolithic blocks of the USSR and Nato – though not without alarming bumps – were able to reach a shared understanding of doctrine that is today absent,” he said. “Doctrine is opaque in Moscow and Beijing, let alone Pyongyang or Tehran.” Lovegrove, who was appointed to Whitehall’s most senior defence role in March 2021, added: “During the cold war, we benefited from a series of negotiations and dialogues that improved our understanding of Soviet doctrine and capabilities, and vice versa. This gave us both a higher level of confidence that we would not miscalculate our way into nuclear war. “Today, we do not have the same foundations with others who may threaten us in the future – particularly with China. Here the UK strongly supports President Biden’s proposed talks with China as an important step.” Joe Biden, the US president, is expected to have a phone call with China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Thursday – their first conversation since March – in an attempt to defuse tensions over Taiwan. Taiwanese troops have practised fighting off an invasion as tensions with Beijing intensified over plans by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, to visit the self-governing island. China insists Taiwan, which has its own democratically elected government, is its sovereign territory and is determined to reunify the island, by force if necessary. Last year, Beijing tested a hypersonic missile that circumnavigated the globe before hitting a target. China, Russia and the US are also developing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre in the air. Lovegrove praised the White House’s decision to re-engage with China but also highlighted the risks of technological advances. “We have clear concerns about China’s nuclear modernisation programme that will increase both the number and types of nuclear weapon systems in its arsenal,” he said. Russia became the first country to use hypersonic systems during a war when Moscow deployed its Kinzhal missiles in Ukraine. The Kremlin claims the missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, said in a speech earlier this month that western support for Ukraine has triggered the most serious crisis in relations between Russia and the west since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Despite the increased risks, Lovegrove said much of the existing architecture remains “vital”, such as the chemical weapons convention and the biological and toxin weapons convention, and the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, he added that the reality is “that current structures alone will not deliver what we need a modern arms control system to achieve”. On the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the former permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence said: “We recently passed the grim milestone of 150 days since Putin launched this unprovoked, illegal war, bringing untold suffering to the innocent people of Ukraine. “I’m afraid the conflict fits a pattern of Russia acting deliberately and recklessly to undermine the global security architecture. “That’s a pattern that includes the illegal annexation of Crimea, the use of chemical and radiological weapons on UK soil, and the repeated violations that caused the collapse of the INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces] treaty. “And we will continue to hold Russia to account for its destabilising actions as an international community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/09/keir-starmer-power-uk-cheap-labour-spending-public-services-election","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-09T15:30:20Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer may win power, but he won’t be able to turn the UK around on the cheap | James Meadway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/09/keir-starmer-power-uk-cheap-labour-spending-public-services-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/09/keir-starmer-power-uk-cheap-labour-spending-public-services-election","fields":{"bodyText":"Keir Starmer’s Labour party may well win the next election. Its leadership have begun to put together a story of where Britain is going wrong, and what Labour could do instead. But without commitments on spending, the party will fail in government. Across the world, the economic outlook is bad, with the IMF forecasting widespread recession over the next year. Food prices are continuing to rise. There are the early signs of debt crises in the global south. Climate breakdown and geopolitical tensions are adding to the instability. If last year was bad, this year is set to be worse. However, if the picture everywhere is grim, Britain is uniquely underperforming. Britain is the only G7 country not to have recovered to pre-pandemic levels of GDP. And this failed recovery comes after a decade in which productivity growth and real incomes stagnated. Labour, if it wins the next election, is likely to inherit an economic situation worse than that faced by any government since 1945. The contrast with 1997, as Andy Beckett has suggested, is stark: while Blair inherited a growing economy and rising living standards for most, Starmer is likely to immediately face a recession, collapsing public services, high inflation and the rising costs of climate breakdown. The major culprit in our decline was austerity. The social damage has been immense: if the NHS is on its knees today, for example, it is not only from its own underfunding, but cuts elsewhere in the system, notably to social care. Michael Marmot’s report on healthcare after the pandemic made grimly clear just how much damage austerity had done. Life expectancy, after more than a century of improvement, has now started to stagnate. But the impacts stretch right across the economy. The former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has warned that the worsening health of the British public has become an economic drag. About half a million people have dropped out of the labour force since the spring of 2019, largely in part due to Covid. NHS and public health failures feed into economic woes. Both Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have committed to opposing austerity. Reeves rightly told last year’s Labour conference that it “has left our country poorer, our public services at breaking point, and our public finances in tatters”. Starmer, in his new year speech, has expanded his critique of the Tory government to include what he labelled the “Westminster system” that “hoards power” in a few hands. He has spoken of the need for “national renewal”, driven by “missions” including rapid decarbonisation – a nod towards the influence of the economist Mariana Mazzucato. The planned creation of a publicly owned renewable generator, Great British Energy, to deliver rapid decarbonisation shows some willingness to break with the neoliberal past. Starmer is right to broaden the critique. Failure on the scale of Britain’s is about more than just a single party. Austerity is a classic case: in defiance of good economic sense, a radical programme of spending cuts from 2010 onwards was supported by almost our entire political class. Treasury civil servants drew up the plans. The Institute for Fiscal Studies justified them to the public. Our media repeated the government’s idiotic slogans. Labour, with Ed Balls as shadow chancellor, fell into line. And the result has been a catastrophic economic and social failure. To break with the legacy of failure, however, will require increased spending, and more. Gordon Brown, after 2000, increased spending on public services, but in the absence of institutional reform, and with New Labour actively encouraging a bloated financial services sector, his public spending rises did not survive a change of government. Labour leaderships since 2010 have identified versions of the underlying institutional failures, both in the state machine and the wider economy. Ed Miliband had “producers v predators”. Jeremy Corbyn spoke of Britain’s “rigged economy”. Corbyn’s proposed economic programme backed up this rhetoric with important institutional changes, including sectoral collective bargaining and expanded worker ownership of companies. But if Corbyn ended up, by 2019, heavily focused on dramatic spending increases at the expense of his broader programme, Starmer has the opposite problem: focusing on a few constitutional changes and a critique of the institutions but making very few spending commitments. From the NHS to our schools, every part of the public sector needs more cash. Whatever the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, might hint at, there is no magic wand in the private sector that can be waved. And in conditions of profound economic failure, no longer enjoying the luxury of ultra-low borrowing costs and with the exchange rate a potential concern, spending increases will have to be met by at least some tax rises. The grave risk to Starmer’s programme is that its institutional critique and a few worthwhile ideas will be eviscerated in government if funding is not rapidly made available for improved public services. Peter Mandelson and Ed Balls have been among those trying to talk down spending increases. But this isn’t the 1990s. The public reaction to continued austerity, especially from a Labour government, is likely to be overwhelming: in protests, strikes – and at the polls. Even governments with a healthy majority can sometimes only last a single term, as the Tories appear to be about to demonstrate. “National renewal” cannot be achieved on the cheap.

You can find a summary of what we know about Jack Teixeira’s arrest here. Here, meanwhile, is the other Ukraine-related news over the last day: UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded Bakhmut, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Fragmentation of the global economy into rival trading blocs runs the risk of prompting a new cold war, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said a combination of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and shortcomings with globalisation had led to a potentially dangerous splintering. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. Norway will expel 15 Russian embassy officials who it said were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The European Union has added Russia’s Wagner group to its sanctions list for “actively participating in the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine”. The mercenary group had already been placed on another EU sanctions list in February for violating human rights and “destabilising” countries in Africa. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must be part of Ukraine again and a real peace will come by restoring the country’s borders, foreign minister Dmitro Kuleba has said on Thursday. “There is no difference between...any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has awarded £650m to manufacturers working on its Tempest fighter jet, in the latest sign that the UK is pushing forward with the aim of producing the aircraft by 2035. The Tempest programme is seen as a key part of the UK’s plans for defence spending and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put pressure on the government to increaseits investment. ExxonMobil handed its chief executive a 52% pay increase to $35.9m (£28.7m) for 2022 after the oil company reported its highest ever profits amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Darren Woods’ salary rose by 10% to $1.9m last year while his bonus and share awards surged by 80% compared with the year before. What kind of impact might the leaks have? The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. The Washington Post has spoken to a friend of Teixeira’s, who had this to say: Teixeira was a ‘pretty normal guy’ outside the server, said the friend, who eventually met Teixeira in person. He had a ‘slight temper’ and was ‘more of a mentor than a leader.’ Sharing the classified documents was meant ‘to educate people who he thought were his friends and could be trusted’ free from the propaganda swirling outside, the friend said. … ‘I was of the opinion that some of these kids were prone to run their mouths because they spent too much time online, but I was ignored,’ said the friend, who added that he tried to stay out of such discussions. ‘It was pretty obnoxious to see kids who grew up in the suburbs argue about a conflict an ocean away.’ … ‘He loved America but simply didn’t feel confident in its future,’ the friend said. ‘At the end of the day he would side with this country over any other.’ Other members of Teixeira’s server have showed The Post video of Teixeira shouting racist and antisemitic slurs before firing a rifle and said he referenced government raids at Ruby Ridge in Idaho and in Waco, Tex. – events with deep resonance among right-wing, anti-government extremists. The name of the Discord server itself derives from a meme taken from a gay porn video often used for its shock value and laughs, the members said. Here are the key developments in the Pentagon leaks story, and Teixeira’s arrest: The Department of Justice arrested 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online, US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. Teixeira was arrested at his home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts by FBI agents. Helicopter news footage showed a young man with shorn dark hair, an olive green T-shirt and red shorts being made to walk backwards towards a team of agents standing by an armoured vehicle dressed in camouflage and body armour, pointing their rifles at him. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. The likely charges could each carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm, said Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor. Among the clues that lead to Teixeira’s arrest was the kitchen countertop and floor tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. Teixeira is believed to have been the leader of an online chat group where hundreds of photographs of secret and top-secret documents were first uploaded, from late last year to March. The online group called itself Thug Shaker Central, made up of 20 to 30 young men and teenagers brought together by an enthusiasm for guns, military gear and video games. Racist language was a common feature of the group. Speaking in Ireland, Joe Biden sought to play down the impact of the breach. “I’m not concerned about the leak,” Biden said. “I’m concerned that it happened. But there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that’s of great consequence.” Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sought to cast Teixeira as a right-wing hero, writing on Twitter, “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Thursday that his country had not sold arms to Ukraine and would not do so, after a leaked Pentagon report said Belgrade had agreed to provide arms to Kyiv, according to foreign media reports. “Serbia has not nor it will export weapons to Ukraine,” Vucic told reporters, according to the Beta news agency. He added that the Balkan nation, a traditional Russian ally, “has not nor will it” send ammunition to either Ukraine or Russia. “There is no paper that would show something like that,” he added. Teixeira’s mother, Dawn, confirmed to the New York Times that her son was a member of the air national guard and said that recently he had been working overnight shifts at a base on Cape Cod, and in recent days he had changed his phone number. A number for Bayberry Farm and Flower Co, a flower business believed to be owned by Jack Teixeira’s mother, went to voicemail. A message said the business is closed this week. The company is based at the same North Dighton, Massachusetts, address where Teixeira is understood to live. It is owned by Dawn and Tom Dufault – public records show that Dawn Dufault was previously known as Dawn Teixeira. The company’s Facebook page had mentioned Jack Teixeira in June 2021. “Jack is on his way home today, tech school complete, ready to start his career in the Air National Guard!” a message said, under a photograph of a “Welcome home” balloon. Here is what we know about Teixeira: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, has posted a tweet painting Teixeira as a hero. “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime …Ask yourself who is the real enemy? A young low level national guardsmen? Or the administration that is waging war in Ukraine, a non-Nato nation, against nuclear Russia without war powers? Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod, Mass, the Air National Guard Base where Teixeira is stationed, states that its mission is to “provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control along with trained and experienced Airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security”. It hosts the 102nd Intelligence Wing, in which Teixeira worked. Here is how the arrest happened, according to the New York Times. Heavily armed FBI agents arrived outside Teixeira’s mother’s home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts, and started calling the 21-year-old’s name, according to a neighbour. Teixeria emerged, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, an was put in a van. Then, “Multiple sport-utility vehicles and an armored vehicle descended on the home, and agents wearing helmets and flak jackets and carrying military-style assault rifles entered the property on foot. Overhead, a twin-engine surveillance plane circled.” Teixeira will appear in court in Massachusetts on Friday, the Associated Press reports. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect raises questions about how such a profound breach could have been caused by a young, low-ranking service member. “We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. Among the ways that Teixeira was identified is through the kitchen countertop and tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor now with the law firm Morrison Foerster, said the likely charges could carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm. Several of Teixeira’s family members serve in the military, the New York Times reports, and the 21-year-old airman joined straight after highschool, in 2021. The paper has painted this portrait of the person suspected of leaking US intelligence documents online: While talking with friends online, Jack Teixeira…assumed the role of a leader. He guided a group of 20 to 30 people, mostly young men and teenagers, as they bonded over guns, racist memes, video games and international politics. … His friends in the online group, a Discord channel named Thug Shaker Central, said in interviews that it was a place that brought together lonely people during the pandemic. Sometimes, when they played war-themed video games, Airman Teixeira wanted to teach his friends about actual war, they said. Here is an image of his arrest earlier today: Hi, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our live coverage of the arrest of Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. If you have questions, comments or see news you may have missed, drop me a line on Twitter here. It is slightly past 5:30pm in Washington DC and 12:30pm Kyiv. Here are the day’s key developments so far: US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has arrested 21-year old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded Bakhmut, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians.Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. A congratulatory post by the 102nd Intelligence Wing about 21-year old Jack Teixeira last July is still currently up on its Facebook page. “Congratulations to some of the 102nd Intelligence Wing’s most recent promotees! Way to go!!” the post said, with Jack Teixeira’s name included on the post. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. Agence France-Presse reports: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Russian forces took control of the six-reactor plant in embattled southern Ukraine in March last year. “We are living on borrowed time when it comes to nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” Grossi said in a statement. “Unless we take action to protect the plant, our luck will sooner or later run out, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” he added. Two landmine explosions occurred outside the plant’s perimeter fence - the first on 8 April, and another four days later, according to the statement. It was not immediately clear what caused the blasts, it said. US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has arrested 21-year old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. “Teixeira is an employee of the United States Air Force National Guard. FBI agents took Teixeira into custody this afternoon without incident. He will have an initial appearance at the US District Court of the district of Massachusetts,” he added, thanking the FBI and the DOJ for their “diligent work on this case.” Garland said the investigation remains ongoing. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. The FBI said on Thursday it has “made an arrest and is continuing to conduct authorized law enforcement activity at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts,” amid reports that a suspect in the leak of classified information has been identified. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, will make a statement on the situation at 2.30pm, Reuters reports. Aerial footage released by Sky 5 shows a young man being arrested by a handful of federal agents. The young man can be seen with his hands on his head, clad in a T-shirt and shorts. “This is not just about the Department of Defense. This is about the US government…and how we protect and safeguard information,” said Ryder. “We do have strict protocols in place… Anytime there is an incident…an opportunity to refine it, we are of course going to take advantage of that,” he added. “We continue to work around the clock along with the inter-agency and intelligence community to understand the scope, scale and impact of these leaks,” Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder said in a press briefing on Thursday regarding the recent leaks of US intelligence online. “We will be limited in what we can say about the documents themselves … As a matter of longstanding policy, just because classified information may be posted online and elsewhere does not mean it has been declassified by classification authority,” added Ryder. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The FBI wants to question a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the leak of highly classified military documents on the Ukraine war, according to a report. The guardsman has been identified by the New York Times as 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, who reportedly oversaw an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department.

Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Germany has approved a request by Poland to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich after his trial. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, Kuleba said in an address to the Black Sea security conference. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata are “not regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats. Swedish prosecutors said they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic.

Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident.

Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). Romania, Moldova and Ukraine have signed cooperation agreements after a trilateral meeting on ways to strengthen security in their Black Sea region to counter threats posed by Russia’s aggression. The three neighbouring countries’ foreign and defence ministers, government officials and international partners gathered today in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, for the Black Sea Security Conference. The aim was to address the wide-ranging impact that Moscow’s war in Ukraine on the region, AP reported. Russia was “the most direct and serious threat” to the Black Sea region and Nato, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said. Calling for a strong Nato presence in the region, he said: Instead of peace and stability, the Black Sea region has become the primary target of the Russian aggression. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who addressed the conference via videolink, also said the Nato military alliance should play a bigger role in security in the Black Sea, and integrate Ukraine’s air and missile defences with those of Nato members. Kuleba, referring to Finland’s recent admission to the alliance, said: It’s time to turn the Black Sea into what the Baltic Sea has become, a sea of Nato. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić, whose leads one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe, told reporters: Serbia has not and will not export weapons to Ukraine. He added that it equally “has not and will not” export arms or ammunition to Russia, adding: “There’s no document that can prove that.” The document seen by the Guardian is a roundup of European positions on providing arms and training from early March, titled “Response to Ongoing Russia-Ukraine Conflict”. It gives the “assessed position” of each country with a tick or a cross. Serbia is assessed to have “provided or committed to provide lethal aid”. It is also reported to have the “military ability” and the “political will” to provide arms in the future. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. He said: They saw one shell (in Ukraine), one bullet. So what, and where else would they appear? There are several war zones around the world. Serbia’s defence minister, Miloš Vučević, and foreign minister, Ivica Dačić, have also dismissed the contents of the leaked intelligence as untrue. Serbia is also the only European country to have opposed all sanctions against Russia. Vučić has sought to maintain ties with Moscow and Beijing while seeking not to alienate the US and EU entirely. His government has voted against Russia several times at the UN general assembly over its invasion of Ukraine. Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The disturbing clip appears to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. It is unclear when or where the video was shot. The video circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Maliar, during a briefing today, said: All cases and videos that appear in the public domain are being investigated, and this is being done by all law enforcement agencies together, who have the technical capabilities and relevant specialists and experts. A member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard suspected of leaking highly classified US intelligence documents will be arrested today in Massachusetts, Reuters is reporting, citing a source familiar with the situation. The FBI wants to question a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the disclosure of classified military documents, AP is citing two people familiar with the matter. As we reported earlier, the New York Times has named Jack Teixeira, 21, as the leader of the online group where the secret documents were posted. The leader of a small online gaming chat group where secret US intelligence documents were leaked is a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, the New York Times is reporting, citing interviews and documents it reviewed. The suspected leaker is Jack Teixeira, 21, who oversaw Thug Shaker Central, an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games, the Times said. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround Bakhmut from the north and the south, while Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded the embattled city in eastern Ukraine. The Bakhmut area remains the most difficult as Russian forces continue “offensive actions in the central part of Bakhmut, as well as in the directions of Bohdanivka and Ivanivske to surround the city from the north and south”, Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department, was quoted by Ukrinform as saying at a briefing on Thursday. He added: Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons. He said Russian forces had lost nearly 4,500 Wagner fighters and regular Russian armed forces servicemen who had been killed or wounded in the area of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian update came Moscow claimed Russian troops were preventing Ukrainian forces from entering or leaving Bakhmut. In a statement published on Thursday, the Russian defence ministry said: Airborne troops are providing support to advancing assault troops, blocking the transfer of Ukrainian army reserves to the city and the possibility of retreat for enemy units. Wagner assault units “were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of Bakhmut, the statement continued. But the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said it was “too early” to say that Bakhmut was surrounded. Ukraine has also denied the Russian ministry’s claims. Army spokesperson Sergiy Cherevaty said Ukrainian forces in the wartorn city were still able to “deliver provisions, ammunition, and medicines” and evacuate wounded troops in Bakhmut. Neither side’s claims have been independently verified. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, discussed the Ukraine crisis during a meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, today, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Qin told Lavrov that there was no “panacea” for resolving the crisis, the ministry said. He added that Beijing will continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement and restarting peace talks, the ministry said. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Prokudin, in a television broadcast, said: The army of the Russian Federation hit Zmiivka in Kherson region with guided aerial bombs, they hit a school and … one person was killed and another was wounded. In addition, a man was killed during the shelling of a park inside Kherson city early in the morning and another person was wounded in a village elsewhere in the region, he said. Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). The Khmelnitsky Orchestra was due to tour the UK this month with two shows: The Magical Music of Harry Potter, and The Music From the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit andThe Rings of Power. The shows had been promoted on the UK government website as an example of British-Ukrainian relations. After the orchestra played the Harry Potter show in Belgium last year, the deputy British ambassador in Brussels, Chloe Louter, hailed it as “an incredible honour to have such an iconic part of British culture being performed by a Ukrainian orchestra”. The promoter, Star Entertainment, has accused the UK government of hypocrisy. “They made a big deal out of supporting the Ukrainians but when it came to giving them visas to play in the UK, they didn’t want to know,” said its chief executive, Jaka Bizilj, who is known in the UK entertainment industry after working with Richard Curtis on two film projects and with Bob Geldof on the Cinema for Peace Foundation, which evacuated the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny from Siberia to Berlin. He called on the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, to stand down if artists keep being treated like this, saying the immigration difficulties experienced by an increasing number of foreign artists “damages UK citizens, culture and the relationship to Europe”. Read the full story here: Earlier we reported that Poland had requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. That request has now been approved, Germany’s defence ministry said. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Joe Biden has said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence services and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” the US president said. “But I don’t have an answer.” He added that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence”. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut.

It comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister has said. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan,” Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council thinktank. A Ukrainian man was admitted to hospital this morning with life-threatening injuries after setting himself on fire outside the Ukrainian consulate in Krakow, Polish police said. The 63-year-old man was “standing in line outside the Ukrainian consulate ... when he started yelling something in Ukrainian, took out a bottle with a flammable substance, doused himself with it and set himself on fire”, a police press officer, Piotr Szpiech, told AFP. He added: An officer on patrol and a witness put out the fire. The man was taken to hospital in a serious, life-threatening condition. Initial media reports suggested the man had been urging fellow citizens to return to Ukraine and fight Russia, AFP said. Poland has requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would respond on Thursday after consultations between his ministry, the chancellery and other stakeholders. He told reporters: The promise is that a reply to our Polish partners will be forthcoming within the day. Swedish prosecutors said on Thursday they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” Reuters reports senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. “The information disclosure may hurt national security,” he added. Nelly Kronstrand reports for the Swedish news site Aftonbladet that “there is no suspicion that the man is connected to a foreign power”. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, on Thursday warned that the country’s new status as a Nato member “doesn’t solve every problem,” and said Helsinki should not let down its guard on security issues. “We still bear the main responsibility for our own security. Wherever we detect any gaps or vulnerabilities, they must be fixed,” Niinistö said, in a speech to lawmakers as they gathered for the first time since the 2 April elections. He added that Finland, which shares a 1,340km (832-mile) border with Russia, had been focused on regional security in the past year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We must not let this level of alertness drop in the future, either,” Associated Press reports the president said as he formally opened the 200-member Eduskunta legislature. “We should better understand how organically the dangers and tensions we are witnessing here are linked with the increasing geopolitical pressures.” If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister said on Thursday. “God forbid, if Ukraine falls, if Ukraine gets conquered, the next day China may attack Taiwan,” Reuters reports Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington DC. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan.” Joe Biden on Thursday said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence community and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” he said on answers. “But I don’t have an answer.” Speaking in Dublin, the US president said that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.” It was the first time Biden has commented publicly about the release of Pentagon documents that were posted on several social media sites. “I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence,” Associated Press reports Biden said while visiting Irish leaders. The documents appear to detail US and Nato aid to Ukraine and US intelligence assessments regarding US allies that could strain ties with those nations. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. The statement by the ministry said: Airborne troops are providing support to advancing assault troops, blocking the transfer of Ukrainian army reserves to the city and the possibility of retreat for enemy units. It added that “Wagner assault units were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of the city in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for the jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich after his trial. Ryabkov, speaking to the state-run Tass news agency, said talks about a possible exchange could take place through a dedicated channel for Russian and US security agencies. He said: We have a working channel that was used in the past to achieve concrete agreements, and these agreements were fulfilled. He stressed that Russia would negotiate on a possible exchange only after a court delivered its verdict in the espionage charge against Gershkovich. Here’s more on Norway’s decision to expel 15 Russian diplomats from the country who they said were suspected of spying while working at the Russian embassy in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata “must leave Norway within a short time”, Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said, adding: “We will not grant visas to intelligence officers who apply for a visa to Norway.” She said: We are not talking about regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests. She declined to say whether the expulsions were in response to a specific incident. The Norwegian government said the activities of the expelled diplomats were “incompatible with their diplomatic status”. The expulsions amount to a quarter of Russian diplomats currently accredited in Oslo, it said. After the Russian foreign ministry said Moscow would respond in kind to Norway’s action, Huitfeldt said: Russia has no reason to respond. We have Norwegian diplomats stationed in Russia, but none of them are undercover intelligence officers. She stressed, however, that Oslo wants “normal diplomatic relations with Russia, and that Russian diplomats are welcome in Norway”. Officials in Moscow’s Odintsovsky district have started printing volunteer military service pamphlets in the Tajik and Uzbek languages, Meduza’s Kevin Rothrock writes. It comes as Russia’s lower and upper houses of parliament approved legislation to tighten its conscription law before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The changes in legislation, which will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft, have fuelled speculation that Russia plans to announce a second wave of mobilisation, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. A large batch of leaked classified US government information, including top-secret briefings, have been discovered online over the past week, with many relating to perhaps the most sensitive arena of intelligence gathering in the world today: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The most significant parts of the leak concern Kyiv’s level of preparedness for an expected counteroffensive. US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. Read the full story here: Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. The disturbing video, which emerged on social media on Wednesday, appeared to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. A second video appeared to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian servicemen lying next to a destroyed military vehicle. In a statement posted to Telegram, the Russian general prosecutor’s office said: In order to assess the credibility of these materials and make an appropriate decision, they have been forwarded to the investigative authorities for verification. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters yesterday that the video was “awful” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of the footage. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. The initiative came from “hawks among top officials of Russia’s security services”, it said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: No, it is not the president’s prerogative, it is the special services who are doing their job. Once again, I would like to remind you that this journalist was caught red-handed. Gershkovich, 31, was detained on 29 March in the city of Ekaterinburg, and the Russian Security Service, FSB, admitted the following day that it had picked him up on suspicion of spying. He was later formally charged with espionage, which Gershkovich and the Wall Street Journal deny. On Tuesday, the US state department officially designated Gershkovich as being wrongfully detained, signalling that Washington views the espionage charges against him as bogus and that he is being held as a hostage. Here’s more from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kuleba, addressing the Black Sea security conference via video link, called the war in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe”. He said: We are united by UN charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, he said. Poland is “sceptical” about French attempts to organise talks between Ukraine and Russia, Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said. In a speech to parliament, Rau said: We do not see any signs that Russia is ready to revise its policy of territorial conquests ... the possible result of such talks cannot be any separate guarantees for Russia, apart from the observance of the norms of international law. His comments came a week after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, held talks with Xi Jinping in which he urged the Chinese leader to bring Russia “back to reason” over the war in Ukraine. After the meeting between Macron and Xi, the French president said his Chinese counterpart had “important words” on Ukraine. He said France and China agreed nuclear weapons should be excluded from the conflict. But just hours later in Moscow, a Russian government spokesperson said he saw no prospect for China to mediate in the Ukraine conflict and that Russia had “no other way” than to press on with its offensive. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo, claiming that they were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. In a statement, the ministry said: The government’s decision is in response to the changed security situation in Europe, which has led to an increased intelligence threat from Russia. The officers concerned “must leave Norway shortly”, it added. The Norwegian foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, said in a statement: This is an important step in countering, and reducing the level of, Russian intelligence activity in Norway, and thus in safeguarding our national interests. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats, state media reported. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. It named a citizen of Ukraine, Yuriy Denisov. The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed in a statement on Telegram that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side have shelled the plant, risking a nuclear accident. In its statement, Energoatom said: A Russian mine exploded near the control room of the fourth power unit at the ZNPP. The Russian occupiers continue to turn the ZNPP into a military base, mining the perimeter around the plant. And these actions cannot but have consequences. According to sources, an explosion rang out near the engine room of the fourth power unit. As the nuclear terrorists themselves stated, their mine detonated. The sounds of the explosion were heard by Ukrainian nuclear workers who continue to work at the ZNPP. However, the Russians tried to “pacify” the workers and quickly cover their tracks so that the IAEA experts would not see it. Europe’s largest nuclear facility continues to suffer from the arbitrariness of the Russian military and their henchmen, while Ukrainian personnel are desperately trying to maintain the nuclear and radiation safety of the entire continent. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that Russia has fined the Wikimedia Foundation a further 2m roubles ($24,500 / £19,500) for failing to remove what the authorities describe as “fake information” about Russia’s military. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. In a statement, Reuters reports Naftogaz described a ruling on Wednesday by The Hague’s arbitration tribunal at the permanent court of arbitration as a “key victory on the energy front”. “Despite Russia’s attempts to obstruct justice, the arbitration tribunal ordered Russia to compensate Naftogaz for losses of $5bn,” it said. Among the property seized by Russia, Suspilne reported, are the energy and gas transportation system as well as the company’s financial assets. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian demands are set out as: reconnecting Rosselkhozbank to the Swift payment service resuming supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and maintenance service lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, plus unblocking access to ports restoring the work of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilisers In the press release, Russia’s foreign ministry claims that the latest statements by the UN about the deal “distorts data and facts”, and that “despite all the grandiloquent statements made about global food security and assistance to countries in need, the Black Sea grain initiative has served Kyiv’s commercial exports exclusively in the interests of western countries.” The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. The Games in Krakow start on 21 June and run until 2 July, with 19 sports being held as Olympic qualifiers. The International Boxing Association (IBA) said the continental qualifier “totally contradicts” Olympic organisers’ recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to return to international competition. “For this reason, the European Games 2023 can no longer remain an IOC recognised qualifier for Paris 2024 and must be annulled,” Reuters reports it said. An air alert has been declared across all of Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. Quoting authorities, it writes that the attack was “prepared by a member of the Ukrainian sabotage and terrorist group, a citizen of Ukraine Yuriy Denisov, born in 1987, who, through an express delivery service through an intermediary, transferred to her in Moscow an explosive device camouflaged as a plaster bust of a military commissar.” Tass added “the procedure for putting him on the international wanted list has been initiated.” You may have seen that we are testing a new feature across some of the Guardian’s live blogs, including the Ukraine live blog, which allows you to contact the live blogger directly.

Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Reuters reports Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The US intelligence leak is also the subject of our First Edition newsletter today. My colleague Archie Bland sums up what we know so far from the leaks about major US allies: Ukraine: US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying that Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. Russia: The leaks suggest that the US has a remarkable level of insight into Russian military operations, with live information about the targets being attacked by Moscow and details of a plan to pay a bonus to soldiers who damage or destroy Nato tanks. Early this morning the New York Times reported (£) that a new batch of 27 pages shows that “the depth of the infighting inside the Russian government appears broader and deeper than previously understood”. There is also information on the Russian mercenary Wagner group’s plan to expand its operations in Haiti, as well as US use of advanced satellite imaging technology to gather intelligence on Russian forces. UK: One document suggests that 97 special forces operatives were in Ukraine in February and March – and 50 of them were British, Harry Taylor and Manisha Ganguly report. Their purpose there is not specified, but it is suggested that the special forces could form part of a coordinated Nato group. UN: Some documents seen by the BBC appear to describe private conversations between the UN secretary general António Guterres and his deputy about a deal to secure the export of grain from Ukraine to help tackle a global food crisis. The files reportedly suggest that the US felt Guterres was too sympathetic to Russian interests, saying that he was “undermining broader efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Ukraine”. South Korea: Documents based in part on intercepted communications show Seoul grappling with US pressure to ship ammunition to Ukraine and concerns that artillery shells requested by Washington for its own use could end up being passed on. South Korea has a longstanding policy of not providing lethal weapons to countries at war. Israel: Another document says that the Mossad intelligence agency encouraged its staff to take part in protests over Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial plans to weaken the independence of the country’s judiciary. Mossad has denied those claims. There is also an assessment of scenarios in which Israel could be persuaded to provide weapons to Ukraine. Overnight the Times of London has reported that MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak of classified US intelligence documents. It writes: Tobias Ellwood, [the Conservative MP] who chairs the defence select committee, said the US leaks could “endanger lives”. “Given our long-established lead in scale and capability when it comes to elite forces it will come as no surprise that our special forces are doing much of the heavy lifting,” he said. “But this deliberate large-scale disclosure of sensitive material could easily endanger lives and should prompt an urgent review about who has access to sensitive information and how it is shared.” Dan Jarvis, the [opposition] Labour MP for Barnsley Central and a former special forces commander in Afghanistan, said the operations were “by necessity shrouded in secrecy”. He added: “Any compromise of secret material regarding their deployment or numerical strength is not only politically embarrassing but also militarily disadvantageous. It risks jeopardising the security and effectiveness of those operations and could put lives at risk.” All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. “There is no difference between … any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” Reuters reports he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. Kuleba also said everyone in Ukraine was “devastated” by the “horrific” video that had emerged appearing to show Russian forces beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this update on overnight events in Ukraine. It writes: At night, Russian troops attacked Slovyansk in Donetsk region with S-300 missiles: the school, residential buildings and the city water canal were damaged. In the past day, one person died in the region, and two others were injured. In the occupied Donetsk region, the Russian military has strengthened local inspections and filtering, increasing the number of checkpoints and patrols in order to hide information about the location of the Russian army, the Ukrainian general staff reported. 46 times from heavy artillery, drones and aviation, the Russian army shelled Kherson oblast yesterday: one person died, two were injured. AFP have spoken to Vitaliy Sydor, a Ukrainian farmer who has resorted to desperate measures to clear explosives from the land himself so he can plant crops. “I bought metal detectors and had a bit of a look on the internet,” said Sydor, 28, about his attempts to render the land usable. He had no protective equipment, he admitted, and relies on a friend with army experience. His village, Novohryhorivka, in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region, was within sight of the Russian frontline and heavily bombarded from March to November last year until the Russians retreated. “Wherever you look there are holes,” said Sydor, indicating the shattered outbuildings and machinery. International demining organisations and military and police sappers are out in force, but the area is vast and some farmers, needing to recoup huge losses, are taking clearance into their own hands. “You can wait a long time. No one knows when they will come and demine everything,” said Sydor, adding that he exchanges information online with other farmers on finding munitions. An estimated half of Mykolaiv region’s agricultural land will go unused this year “due to contamination or fear of contamination”, said Jasmine Dann, regional operations manager for demining charity the Halo Trust, which is working in the region. Sydor’s do-it-yourself approach carries “very big risks”, she said. “There is not only the risk that something will be missed but also that the mines might be booby trapped,” she warned.“Other explosives can be very unstable and explode if tampered with.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang, alongside the foreign minister of Iran, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and minister of state for foreign affairs of Pakistan, Hina Rabbani Khar. Russia has so far offered a muted response to the document leaks. The deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, suggested on Wednesday that the leak might be a US disinformation ploy. “Since the US is a party to the conflict and is essentially waging a hybrid war against us, it is possible that such techniques are being used to deceive their opponent, the Russian Federation,” Ryabkov told Russian news agencies. The Ukrainian government is assessing the possible damage from the disclosures. The files give details of 12 newly formed brigades, equipped with western battle tanks and armoured vehicles, which are likely to lead the assault against dug-in Russian positions. “For sure, people are not happy,” one official admitted on Wednesday. “Ukraine was criticised last year for not being a trustworthy partner. At the beginning of the invasion, we weren’t provided with weapons because of this lack of trust. We lost a lot of territory and people as a result. This perception was wrong. And now this leakage happens from the US side.” It was too early to say whether the leak would affect planning for Ukraine’s counter-offensive, now at an advanced stage, the official indicated. The attack is widely expected to take place in the south of the country, and possibly in the east as well. Ukraine’s goal is to break the land corridor connecting Crimea with Donetsk province and to evict the Russians from the occupied city of Melitopol and the port of Berdiansk. The World Bank said on Wednesday it would finance $200m to help fix Ukraine’s energy and heating infrastructure, with partners and others to provide another $300m as the project expands. The $200m grant will be used to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment, the World Bank said in a statement. The World Bank has mobilised more than $23bn in emergency financing for Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors. More than $20 billion of this has been disbursed through several projects, it said. Energy infrastructure has suffered $11bn in damage over the last year and is one of the most critical areas where Ukraine needs urgent support, said Anna Bjerde, World Bank’s managing director of operations, on Wednesday. During the fall and winter months, more than half of Ukraine’s power infrastructure was damaged, resulting in countrywide power outages that contributed to food, heating and water shortages, the World Bank said. There is increasing evidence that the intelligence leak was not an intelligence operation by a state actor aiming to discredit the US, but more likely the consequence of a Pentagon policy of granting top secret security clearances to huge numbers of service members, civilians and contractors. The number of employees and contractors in the entire US government with top secret clearance is about 1.25 million. OG appears to have acted as a leader on a server originally set up in 2020 on the Discord messaging platform by a small group of gun enthusiasts and gamers. The group went by several names, but most often it was known as Thug Shaker Central. Starting last year, OG is reported to have posted the documents on a channel on the server he named “Bear vs Pig”, a reference to the Ukraine war but also a viral video showing pigs fighting off a black bear. According to the teenage member of the group interviewed by the Post, OG “had a dark view of the government”, portraying the government, and particularly law enforcement and the intelligence agencies, as a repressive force. He ranted about “government overreach”. The Post said details were confirmed anonymously by other members of the group, and that it had viewed a total 300 photographs of classified documents, three times the number previously thought to be circulating. The origins of the leaks on Thug Shaker Central was first reported on Sunday by the Bellingcat investigative journalism group, which also interviewed the same member, who is under 18. However, the Washington Post said the teen member, who had been in touch with OG “in the past few days” had yet to be interviewed by any federal law enforcement officials by the time of publication on Wednesday night, even though the justice department began a criminal investigation and an FBI manhunt was launched at the beginning of the week. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has vowed to “turn over every rock” in pursuit of the leaker. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. The Washington Post interviewed a teenage member of the group, who described the man, referred to by the initials “OG”, from their online correspondence, and shared photographs and videos. The Post also viewed a video of a man identified as OG at a shooting range with a large rifle. “He yells a series of racial and antisemitic slurs into the camera, then fires several rounds at a target,” the report said. OG told fellow members of the same internet group that he worked on a military base, which was not named in the report, where his job involved viewing large amounts of classified information. The leaked documents have laid bare secrets about Ukraine’s preparations for a spring counter-offensive, US spying on allies such as Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, and the tensions between Washington and allied capitals over arming Kyiv. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: the person who leaked US classified documents prompting a national security investigation is a gun enthusiast in his 20s who worked on a military base, the Washington Post reports, citing fellow members of an online chat group. And the World Bank has announced it will finance $200m to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment. Here are the other key recent developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international leaders to act after a disturbing video emerged on Wednesday of Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. Ukraine’s president said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. Belarus has extradited a Russian man who was separated from his daughter and sentenced to two years in prison after she drew anti-war pictures at school. Alexei Moskalyov, a 54-year-old single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, fled house arrest last month, hours before a court handed him a two-year sentence for “discrediting” the Russian army. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, a spokesperson said, while the UN said it was “appalled by particularly gruesome videos” circulating on social media. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the “financial fixers” who have allegedly helped Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov hide their assets. Britain is ready to provide an extra $500 million of loan guarantees to Ukraine, taking the total this year to $1bn, British finance minister Jeremy Hunt said on Wednesday. Hunt said the British loan guarantees had been important to underwrite a broader $15.6 billion IMF four-year package of support. The US also imposed sanctions on more than 120 individuals and entities around the world over their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted people and entities across more than 20 countries and jurisdictions. Russia has hit 333 Canadian officials and public figures with sanctions in what it said was a tit-for-tat move in response to Canada’s sanctions against Moscow and support for Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has again rejected claims by Russia that Russian troops have captured more than 80% of the embattled city of Bakhmut. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern military command, insisted on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces controlled “considerably” more than 20% of it in the east. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck Ukrainian army reserves attempting to break through to Bakhmut. It also claimed that fighters from Russia’s private Wagner mercenary group had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the city. The claims were not verified. Russia has tightened its conscription law, including introducing electronic military draft papers, before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The lower and upper houses of parliament rushed through legislation that will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft while automatically banning registered conscripts from leaving the country. Russian-installed authorities in annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled traditional military parades to celebrate Victory Day and May Day, the Russian-appointed leader of Crimea has said, citing security reasons. Sergei Aksyonov’s statement on Wednesday came a day after he said Crimea was on guard and that Russian forces had built “modern, in-depth defences”. Serbia has agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already, according to a classified Pentagon document. Serbia is one of the only countries in Europe that has refused to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. South Korea has reportedly agreed to “lend” the US 500,000 rounds of artillery, as Seoul attempts to minimise the possibility that the ammunition could end up in Ukraine - a move that could spark domestic criticism of President Yoon Suk-yeol. South Africa has said that an international arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war was a “spanner in the works” before a Brics summit in the country in August. The Russian president is due to attend a summit of Brics countries but the host nation is a member of the International Criminal Court and would be expected to make the arrest if Putin steps foot in the country. The German government is very worried about the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s worsening health condition, a government spokesperson has said. Navalny’s spokesperson on Tuesday said he had lost 8kg in 16 days while in solitary confinement, and that he was not receiving any treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/12/communal-violence-and-civilian-deaths-in-sudan-fuel-fears-of-widening-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Communal violence and civilian deaths in Sudan fuel fears of widening conflict ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/12/communal-violence-and-civilian-deaths-in-sudan-fuel-fears-of-widening-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/12/communal-violence-and-civilian-deaths-in-sudan-fuel-fears-of-widening-conflict","fields":{"bodyText":"The deaths of dozens of civilians in fighting in the far south of Sudan and an outbreak of communal violence in the restive Darfur region have fuelled fears that communities across the frontier regions of Africa’s third biggest country are being drawn into the bloody contest between two rival generals. Fighting in the southern state of North Kordofan between militias aligned with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group and local brigades of the Sudanese army has centred on the strategically important state capital, El Obeid. “The two sides went to war and the civilians in the middle got hurt in their houses,” said Hafiz Mohamed, the UK-based director of Justice Africa Sudan, who is from the region. The city sits astride key communications links between Khartoum and Darfur, the home of the RSF leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, and many of his fighters. It also has an airstrip, which like others across the country is crucial to the army’s air superiority and therefore a valuable target for the RSF. Medics in El Obeid said the first round of fighting centred on El Abyad neighbourhood, killing 10 people including seven children and wounding more than 20. A local hospital struggled to deal with the influx of injured, facing power cuts as generators ran out of fuel, and a shortage of blood. In a second round of fighting on Sunday, 15 people were killed when the RSF attacked a village south of El Obeid. The paramilitaries’ aim appears to be to secure approaches to the town before launching a more substantial assault, local observers said. “The return of the battles to [Kordofan] increases the scope of the absurd war from the capital, Khartoum,” the Sudanese Medical Association said last week. The nationwide death toll of more than four weeks of fighting stands at 700, though the true figure is almost certainly much higher as many fatalities are going unrecorded, especially in remote areas. Talks between representatives of the army and the RSF in Saudi Arabia are aimed only at securing a temporary ceasefire to allow aid to reach civilians. In Darfur, there is growing evidence that the rivalry between the two factions battling for control of Khartoum is aligning with deep social, economic and ethnic divides. Observers say some of the violence recalls the events of 2003-6, when at least 300,000 people were killed and millions displaced after the then dictator, Omar al-Bashir, deployed fighters mainly recruited from Arab tribes against rebels. The RSF grew out of the Arab militia, which were known as the Janjaweed. In El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, a temporary truce between the RSF and the army led to communal clashes, local activists and others in the town said. A witness said the majority of the clashes in the town were between Janjaweed and Masalit fighters, whom he described as “local armed Africans”. Another source said: “Both parties have withdrawn their security troops outside of the town, but … warfare between Masalit tribesmen and Arab tribesmen has resurfaced, caused by the security vacuum after the two warring sides left.” There has been a spate of attacks on camps housing people displaced by previous violence, most of whom do not identify as Arab, as well as systematic efforts to destroy humanitarian infrastructure. In Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, the biggest market in the region has been destroyed, a medical supply warehouse gutted by fire, and government institutions, private businesses, national and international organisations and some stores looted. “Access to health services is almost impossible because most health centres have been looted or are closed,” said Fihaa Hussein Ahmed, a nutrition and health officer with Mercy Corps, the global humanitarian organisation, who is based in Nyala. “Some hospitals are operational, but the situation on the streets makes it unsafe to reach these facilities.” In a sign that the region could be poised for an escalation in violence, a source close to Mini Arko Minnawi, a rebel leader in Darfur in the 2000s, said fighters loyal to him were heading from the capital to the region to “protect Darfur and the Darfurian people”. Reports have emerged of civilians arming themselves to defend their lives, families and property. Dagalo is from Darfur’s Arab Rizeigat people and rose to prominence with the Janjaweed. His bid to win power over the whole of Sudan in the wake of Bashir’s fall in 2019 has been described as an effort by previously marginalised Arabs to seize the country’s crumbling state and its valuable resources from the dominant elite in Khartoum. Non-Arab populations on the peripheries fear they will be “double losers” in the current conflict, said one Darfur-based activist, who asked for his name to be withheld. Analysts said the battle for Darfur was intense because the region could now provide a vital redoubt for Dagalo if the RSF loses ground elsewhere. The RSF has already invested considerable resources in building up its infrastructure and support in its stronghold. “If the RSF is kicked out of Khartoum, they will likely move back to Darfur to reorganise, replenish and then create havoc in the peripheries,” said Anette Hoffmann, of the Clingendael Institute. “The SAF [army] won’t bother too much about ongoing fighting in the peripheries – they never did – but instead, focus on holding and defending Khartoum. “Should, however, RSF get the upper hand in Khartoum, we will likely see a quick descent into open civil war throughout the country and along ethnic lines. The RSF won’t be able to provide any services to the population under their control. We’ll see even less services, more chaos.” Additional reporting by Zeinab Mohammed Salih in Khartoum"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/05/far-right-government-of-israels-plans-to-limit-power-of-judiciary-condemned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T14:51:49Z","webTitle":"Israeli government plan to limit judicial powers sharply criticised","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/far-right-government-of-israels-plans-to-limit-power-of-judiciary-condemned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/05/far-right-government-of-israels-plans-to-limit-power-of-judiciary-condemned","fields":{"bodyText":"Civil liberties and human rights advocates have expressed grave concerns about a plan by Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right Israeli government to limit the power of the judiciary, saying it will encourage authoritarianism and put minority rights in imminent danger. “If they succeed, it’s a different system, a different Israel,” said Dan Meridor, a former justice minister, stressing that in the absence of a constitution, the country’s courts serve to protect people from “being at the mercy of the governing majority”. Under the plan, announced late on Wednesday by the current justice minister Yariv Levin, parliament would have the power to invalidate supreme court decisions with a majority vote of its 120 members. In effect this would grant Netanyahu, who commands a 64-seat coalition including ultra-Orthodox and anti-Arab legislators, an easy way of overriding the court and, critics warn, pushing through radical legislation. Liberal Jewish and Arab leaders have predicted that new laws could target minorities and the right to protest while facilitating annexation in the occupied West Bank. The plan, which has yet to be written into law, also increases the influence of politicians and the government in selecting the court’s members, and enables cabinet members to appoint their own legal advisers in place of the civil service professionals who currently can thwart initiatives deemed problematic. Levin said the changes were necessary because the judiciary was overly active, “interfering” in government decision-making and Knesset legislation, bringing public trust to an all-time low, crippling the government’s ability to govern and inflicting a major blow to democracy. “We go the ballot box and vote but time after time people we didn’t elect make the decisions for us,” he said. Israelis opposed to the changes fear for the country’s democratic health, defending the court as a bulwark for minority rights. “If these steps are carried out we will have in Israel a change of governance from a partial democracy to outright authoritarian rule,” warned the journalist Gidi Weitz in Haaretz. Amnon Lord, a columnist for the rightwing Israel Hayom newspaper, disputed this view, saying Levin was only redressing judicial activism that had established a “parallel government” in which the supreme court had taken on powers in military, economic and other issues. Levin denied that his plan was related in any way to deliberations at the supreme court on the legality of a new law that would enable Netanyahu’s key coalition partner, Aryeh Deri, the head of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, to serve as finance minister despite being convicted for tax evasion. Critics have also stressed that the Levin plan could lead to the overturning of corruption proceedings against Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing. Noa Sattath, director-general of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said she considered each step in the plan “devastating”. Sattath said that by removing judicial oversight the plan could lead to curtailment of freedom to protest, harm the political representation of Israel’s Arab minority, heighten discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, lead to indefinite detention of asylum seekers and facilitate the permanent annexation of the occupied West Bank. “This is definitely an attempt to transform the democratic sphere in Israel and shrink it dramatically. Israeli democracy is weak in that there are no rights for Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian Territories and our democratic culture is very weak. This dramatically reduces that further.” Yousef Jabareen, who teaches human rights law at Haifa University and is a former legislator for the predominantly Arab Hadash party, said that while Arab Israelis have been disappointed by the supreme court, which itself leans hard right, “we still believe it is important to have judicial review especially with this extreme-right government”. He predicted the plan would “give the government a free hand for deepening and widening discrimination against the Arab community”, including making investments whose sole aim is to settle Jews in regions of the country heavily populated by Arabs. “Levin’s plan is a serious threat, it’s not just a declaration,” Jabareen said. The US ambassador, Tom Nides, said that keeping the countries’ “shared values” in mind, Washington would not rush to judgment. “This democracy will withstand a lot and that’s why it’s so vibrant,” he told Army Radio. “I’m not in a position to tell Israel what to do. But I am certainly willing to express my concerns and anxiety from where we stand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-25T01:51:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 367 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirming that four tanks had been delivered. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv to mark the the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. The US has announced that it will offer over $10bn in assistance to Ukraine. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education and emergency services”. Washington has also announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced. He said Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion. The EU Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, said “as far as [refugees from] Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being”, referring to a potential increase in refugees. The US Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, pledged American solidarity with Ukraine. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism and valour personified by President Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people,” the Democrat said. The Group of Seven has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. It promised measures against Russian diamond exports, warning that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. The G7 is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of its sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. A “people’s court” has endorsed an indictment against Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible”, AP reported. Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – as well as of Crimea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/kremlin-decision-to-target-ukraines-cities-was-political-not-tactical","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T18:10:15Z","webTitle":"Kremlin decision to target Ukraine’s cities was political, not tactical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/kremlin-decision-to-target-ukraines-cities-was-political-not-tactical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/kremlin-decision-to-target-ukraines-cities-was-political-not-tactical","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s wave of missile and drone strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major cities in Ukraine at the time of the morning rush hour marks a cynical response from the Kremlin to the bombing of the Kerch strait bridge to Crimea. Its victims were overwhelmingly civilians, in what were the first strikes on the capital since the end of June, hitting buildings, streets, parks and children’s playgrounds. Power supplies in Lviv and Kharkiv were also affected in an attack that brought mass fear not seen since the first six weeks of the war. Little, if any, of what was struck appears to have any direct military significance, and the cynical decision to target Kyiv and other urban centres was clearly political, despite what the Russian president said on Monday morning. “A massive strike was carried out with long-range high-precision air, sea and land-based weapons on Ukraine’s energy, military command and communications facilities,” the Russian president said chillingly. But it should not be forgotten that the wilful or reckless targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure are, simply, war crimes that have left at least 11 dead. Their goal is to strike fear into Ukraine’s leadership and its civilian population, in the hope Kyiv will eventually feel forced to negotiate while Russia still occupies a sixth or more of Ukraine’s land. Ukraine was undeniably anxious on Monday and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will use the fact of the attacks to press for even tougher western sanctions and more missile defence systems at an online G7 meeting on Tuesday lunchtime, which it clearly badly needs. But for all the chaos the attacks have brought, the question will be whether this assault on the cities will endure. Early in September, Kharkiv was targeted by a vicious wave of missile attacks after Ukraine’s battlefield success near the country’s second city, with power and water supplies temporarily knocked out. However, the intensity of the attacks subsequently subsided, and they had no major impact on the battlefield, where Russia continues to lose ground in the northern sector of the front, losing the city of Lyman in the last few days. It is not at all obvious that Russia can maintain an intensification of the missile strikes for an extended period, given how much ammunition it has used in the war so far, and how much internationally political condemnation such attacks will attract. The military reality is also that Russian missile strikes will do nothing to change the balance of power on the ground in the fighting, and whatever fear they provoke, they will not affect Ukraine’s desire to resist, at least in the short term. As it stands, Ukraine is also gaining ground on the way to Kherson in the south as well as in the northern Donbas. The Kremlin knows its current military position is weak, which is why Monday’s attack serves a second purpose, to try to quiet the hardline nationalists who are its principal critics. No wonder, then, that Moscow appears to be trying to bring Belarus closer into the war, with the two countries promising to deploy a joint military taskforce. But Belarus’s army is small, only 11,700 strong plus 6,150 special forces (most of its forces are militia to repress internal dissent). This may mean that the grisly events of Monday have less of a long-term significance than it might appear. But the problem is that, with Russian forces clearly losing ground, Putin’s decision-making is becoming more vicious. Moscow knows it needs to escalate and has already tried recruiting prisoners and forced conscription, with no immediate results. Now it has resorted to a wave of mass urban bombing, and may well do so again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/04/manchester-police-granted-stop-and-search-powers-after-stabbing-of-boy-15","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T23:07:17Z","webTitle":"Manchester police granted stop-and-search powers after stabbing of boy, 15","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/04/manchester-police-granted-stop-and-search-powers-after-stabbing-of-boy-15","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/04/manchester-police-granted-stop-and-search-powers-after-stabbing-of-boy-15","fields":{"bodyText":"The stabbing of a 15-year-old boy has led to an order granting police additional stop-and-search powers in Greater Manchester.

After months of speculation, and amid perceptible impatience in some foreign capitals, its long-awaited counteroffensive appears at last to be in its preliminary stages. The deputy defence minister has acknowledged that “offensive actions” have begun in some areas. They appear to be testing and – perhaps – creating Russian vulnerabilities, presumably with a view to determining where to commit key troops along the 600-mile frontline. Russia has created multiple layers of defences; US sources have suggested that those could prove less formidable than they appear. The urgency of this offensive may be felt most strongly by those living under Russian occupation. Momentum is necessary to maintain the morale of soldiers and a nation. Yet success is also required to reassure foreign capitals that support for Kyiv is not only desirable but still effective – that the arms and ammunition sent produce results on the ground. Ukraine’s leaders have been astonishingly successful in persuading other leaders to step up supplies, providing the kind of equipment ruled out as unthinkable only months before. But support is not infinite and Joe Biden is preparing to run against Donald Trump, who will not even say he wants Ukraine to win, for the presidency in 2024. All the conjecture about Kyiv’s plans and abilities can obscure perhaps the most important fact about this endeavour. What is often fogged, for those watching from afar, is not just what happens in each battle, with what effort and weaponry, to what military and political effect, but the human price. Those attacking usually suffer far more casualties than those defending. Even extraordinary success for Kyiv – whether in liberating territory or by engaging and destroying Russian formations – will cost the lives of large numbers of fighters, many of whom were teachers or farmers or engineers or artists until war was forced upon them. Civilians too will continue to pay. On Sunday, a two-year-old girl was killed in a Russian strike on Dnipro. The death of children is an increasingly familiar horror; another was unleashed on Tuesday with the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and power plant on the Dnipro River – forcing thousands to flee to safety as their homes and land were flooded in a human-made disaster that could have consequences for generations. Kyiv and Moscow blame each other for the attack. The immediate benefit is to Russia, in helping to fend off a Ukrainian advance. It has been relentless in targeting other parts of Ukraine’s power network. But the devastation also cuts off desperately needed water supplies to annexed Crimea. Experts say that there is no immediate risk to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant upstream, where reactors have already been shut down and the cooling lake on site should be sufficient for the next few months. But the recklessness shown towards the facility underlines the fear that there could be worse to come. For a country fighting off occupiers, the necessity of success is shadowed by its cost. Against an adversary such as Russia, which has shown itself ruthlessly indifferent to distinctions between the military and civilians in war, that will be especially the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/25/rishi-sunak-rejoin-single-market-customs-union-brexit-lies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T11:38:35Z","webTitle":"You have power, Rishi Sunak.

It didn’t end well, as it led to more lies. Most responsible people learn these lessons young, and do not carry them into their professional life. Sadly, the same doesn’t seem true for today’s government. I have always been proud of our UK’s strong democracy and fact-based debate. Brexit changed this, and our government entered a game of lies and coverups on steroids. As the debate of whether we should or should not “do Brexit” started, I remember being very confident about entering the debate, as I was sure that the facts would matter most. I was wrong. As we now know, the facts – certainly as far as the economy is concerned – were largely ignored. “There will be no border in the Irish Sea,” we were told. “There will be no friction in trade with the EU;” “there will be no shortage of labour.” I was sure that the facts would soon emerge and the lies would crash down. But the lies kept coming. We heard the argument that we could deregulate our markets, reduce taxes and still meet all our obligations to climate change and the environment. We heard the argument that we could deregulate yet maintain the highest standards of worker protection. And we heard about the increasing coverups, about illegality, and how badly our underlying economy was performing – not to mention the very elaborate action to cover up the party culture at the heart of government. The reality is that years of lies, policy blunders and incompetence have severely damaged the UK’s reputation. Credibility is the cornerstone of the UK’s licence to operate in international markets. And the next government – whatever shade that will be – must focus on rebuilding the UK’s global reputation. There are a number of steps we can take to do this, including having a transparent and long-term economic vision that marries fiscal discipline with a long-term green industrial policy that the UK can lead globally. There is another policy option that no one yet has the confidence to reverse, and that is to rejoin the single market and customs union. It was the biggest lie of them all: that we could replace the economic upside of being part of the most advanced free-trade zone in the world. No independent trade deal can replace its economic upside. It is time to face up to this as a country. This does not mean opening a debate about rejoining the EU. That ship sailed some time ago. But there is a new possibility. The EU has held out an olive branch: to join a grouping of European countries that don’t want to be part of the EU but do want to benefit from its single market and many collaborative bodies. This in my view is a perfect moment for our new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to pivot and send a clear signal globally that we have listened and learned, and that we are going to take sensible steps to restore our reputation for pragmatism and economic sensibility. This would mean not pandering to the European Research Group and rightwing thinktanks, which have been instrumental in much of the chaos of recent months and weeks. Politically it would be a brave shift, and economically a very pragmatic one. In doing so we would be able to re-engage in markets across Europe and start a new responsible growth coalition that we can be all be proud of. It’s an idea whose time has come. The Liberal Democrats believe in it. Labour needs to pivot to it. But the Conservatives have power and Sunak, new in office, has power, authority and goodwill. This would be putting those three attributes to good use. • Jürgen Maier is vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, co-founder of the social enterprise vocL, and a former chief executive officer of Siemens UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/26/nrls-pride-jersey-debacle-compounded-by-sports-power-imbalance","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T05:41:05Z","webTitle":"NRL’s pride jersey debacle is compounded by sport’s power imbalance | Megan Maurice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/26/nrls-pride-jersey-debacle-compounded-by-sports-power-imbalance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/26/nrls-pride-jersey-debacle-compounded-by-sports-power-imbalance","fields":{"bodyText":"“True to our roots, we welcome everyone to rugby league, regardless of race, colour, religion, ability, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, ancestry, or age. We proudly and publicly stand against intolerance and bigotry, and will actively campaign against it. We treat everyone fairly and equally.” So states the NRL’s 2017 inclusion framework, which was developed after a review by the Australian Human Rights Commission and aims to “promote inclusion and reflect the diversity of our community”. As the Manly Sea Eagles are discovering this week, sometimes the elements of diversity and inclusion can be at odds. When the club announced the team would wear a rainbow strip on their jersey during this week’s game against the Sydney Roosters to promote LGBTIQ+ inclusion in rugby league, there was instant backlash. Seven players told the club they would stand down from the match, as they would not wear the jersey due to their religious and cultural beliefs. It is no doubt an incredibly complex issue, one that sits at the intersections of race, culture, gender identity and sexuality. Those seven players are well within their rights to make the decision not to wear a jersey that conflicts with their religious beliefs. However, it raises many questions about how diversity and inclusion can be fairly applied across the league when personal beliefs are at odds. How does a teammate sitting next to a player who thanks God in a press conference feel if they have been subject to abuse within a religious institution? How do they remove themselves from this situation? Do they have a right to ask that religion is not discussed in front of them? Can recovering alcoholics opt out of wearing jerseys with alcohol sponsorship on them? Can the child of a problem gambler ask for sports betting agencies to be removed from their uniform? These are more complex questions due to the relative power of the institutions in question. Religious organisations and alcohol and gambling companies hold a great deal more societal and financial power than LGBTIQ+ people, and are deeply ingrained in the culture of rugby league, and sport more widely. Thus it is harder for individual players to stand against this power and ask for special consideration. The backlash against Manly has been swift and fierce. Coach Des Hasler fronted a press conference on Tuesday to apologise for the “significant mistake” made by the club. Most notably he apologised for the lack of consultation of key stakeholders before a public announcement was made. It is interesting to consider how this situation would have transpired had this consultation occurred. The Sea Eagles are currently ninth on the ladder, with six rounds remaining before the finals series. This weekend they play the eighth-placed Roosters in what will be a key match in determining their finals hopes. If the discussions had all been kept in-house before making an announcement and seven players told the club they would not play in the match, would the club have been brave enough to forge ahead with the idea? More likely it would have been quietly put in the ‘too hard’ basket and taken off the agenda. Hasler also apologised to the LGBTIQ+ community, noting that he is a great admirer of Ian Roberts – the NRL’s first (and only) openly gay player – who has worked with Manly in instituting the pride jersey. “For any person struggling with identity, we acknowledge the challenges and difficulties,” Hasler said. “My heart goes out to you and your families, and if the club can personally do anything to assist, we will. We are here, we offer our complete support. I apologise to anyone to whom this matter has caused distress.” These are heartfelt words, but how much comfort would they provide to a young rugby league fan struggling with their identity? In handling this issue the way it has, the club has made sexuality and gender identity a subject of debate – with everyone from fans on social media to Paul Gallen on Channel Nine publicly opposing the decision. Had the situation been approached with education and compassion from the outset – engaging Roberts to address the playing group about his experiences as a gay man in rugby league, giving the players with religious objections a voice within the club to explain their reluctance and allowing both groups to understand the challenges the others face and work together to conceptualise a solution – conversations around the sport this week may have been very different. Instead, what we have been given is the most rugby league interpretation of inclusion possible. Rush it through, try to sweep it under the carpet, apologise profusely, hope everyone forgets about it and restore the status quo. It is an approach that is disrespectful of the fans, the players and all those who want the game to be better. If the NRL truly believes they “treat everyone fairly and equally”, now is the time to start demonstrating it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T02:01:58Z","webTitle":"Solar panel inquiries ‘off the charts’ after Alinta boss predicts 35% power price rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","fields":{"bodyText":"A forecast of a 35% rise in power prices by the boss of Alinta Energy, Jeff Dimery, has triggered a burst of inquiries about solar panels, according to the founder of SolarQuotes. “One of our traffic guys came to tell me, ‘traffic is off the charts’,” Finn Peacock said. “It’s completely driven by the media.” Dimery, whose company runs the Loy Yang B coal-fired power station in Victoria, gave the estimate to the AFR’s energy conference on Monday. A day later the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described rising energy costs as the most “problematic aspect of our inflation problem over the course of the next six or nine months”. SolarQuotes saw a similar spike in interest in June, typically a quiet month for the solar industry, after regulators announced looming electricity tariff increases of as much as 20%. The company fielded more than 10,000 inquires, roughly double the level of June 2021 and the most for any month ever. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That spurt in inquiries was an early indicator of an upturn in the solar PV industry. Installations picked up in August and particularly September, according to Tristan Edis, a director at the consultancy Green Energy Markets. He said data for the two months was closer to the boom period of 2020 and 2021, marking “a notable recovery from the prior months of 2022 where numbers were substantially down from the levels for the two previous years”. Total installed capacity in Australia in September was 253 megawatts, or about 17% higher than the year-to-date average, Green Energy Markets data shows. The bounce-back in demand will be welcomed by an industry that had begun to retreat from record numbers for new capacity added in recent years, Edis said. Residential demand was up 13.8% in capacity terms, while commercial demand rocketed by about a third. “It does seem to indicate there’s a recovery,” he said. “If anything, [companies] were cutting back staff before the surge in interest.” Australia has the highest proportionate uptake of solar PV in the world, in part because of relatively high levels of sunshine but also because of high power prices. Fluctuating policies have also contributed to what Dylan McConnell, a contributor in new book The Superpower Transformation, dubs a “solar coaster” of booms and busts in the sector. With solar panels already on about a third of houses in some states, an increasing amount of power is being generated at home. Last month, the region of WA including Perth saw rooftops supply almost three-quarters of demand, nudging overall grid demand to a record low. Edis said that while there were still many suitable rooftops for solar, demand may cool again. One drag will be the rising cost of new systems – in part because of supply chain issues in China – and the “pittance” being paid to households for the surplus energy supplied back into the grid. Labor shortages, too, will add to installation costs as they are doing in many parts of the economy, he said. Peacock, of SolarQuotes, said that while system prices had increased, they were “not putting people off” yet. With the media speculation about how high electricity tariffs might go, buyers see panels as “an insurance against further price rises”, he said. The size of systems is also ticking up, with an average unit now about 8 kilowatts of capacity. Also on the rise are inquiries about batteries to accompany the panels to store surplus power. In October so far, about one in five inquiries about solar panels also include a query about batteries, up from about 12% a year ago. Another pointer to the way the industry is headed is the increase in electric vehicle purchases. Tesla’s Model Y was the third-most popular car sold in Australia last month with the company selling almost 6,000 all-electric vehicles, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. Peacock said EV owners, who often already have solar panels, are becoming a new source of inquiries because they find their current systems are too small. That shift could generate fresh demand for the sector in the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/09/doug-mastriano-prayer-republican-capitol-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Doug Mastriano prayed for Trump to ‘seize the power’ before Capitol attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/09/doug-mastriano-prayer-republican-capitol-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/09/doug-mastriano-prayer-republican-capitol-attack","fields":{"bodyText":"A week before the Capitol attack, on a video call organised by a member of a Christian nationalist group, a Pennsylvania state senator who is the Republican candidate for governor in the battleground state prayed that supporters of Donald Trump would “seize the power” on 6 January 2021. Doug Mastriano attended the pro-Trump rally in Washington that day, after which supporters, told by Trump to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat, stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s victory. The riot was linked to nine deaths, including suicides in the aftermath of the attack among law enforcement. Mastriano denies crossing police lines at the Capitol and affiliations with Christian nationalist groups. He is now one of a number of Republican candidates for state positions with sway over elections who support Trump’s lie that his 2020 defeat was the result of voter fraud. Two months from election day, the polling website fivethirtyeight.com puts Mastriano just shy of seven points behind his Democratic opponent. Mastriano’s 6 January prayer, first reported by Rolling Stone on Friday, was delivered during a Zoom call, titled Global Prayer for Election Integrity, organised by what the magazine called “a prominent figure in the far-right New Apostolic Restoration movement”. As defined by Rolling Stone, “Christian nationalism is a central tenet of … NAR [which] emerge[ed] from charismatic Christianity (think: Pentecostalism) and is anchored in the belief that we are living in an age of new apostles and prophets, who receive direct revelations from the holy spirit. “NAR adherents hold that the end times are fast approaching and their calling is to hasten the second coming of Christ by re-fashioning the modern world in a biblical manner.” Mastriano is a US army veteran who once dressed up as a Confederate soldier. In his prayer, he mentioned historical events including the battle of Gettysburg in 1863 and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93, the plane which came down in a field in Pennsylvania on 9/11, after passengers attacked their hijackers. He said: “In 2001, while our nation was attacked by terrorists, a strong Christian man from Paramus, New Jersey, Todd Beamer, said, ‘Let’s roll.’ “God I ask you that you help us roll in these dark times, that we fear not the darkness, that we will seize our Esther and Gideon moments. That … when you say, ‘Who shall I send?’ we will say, ‘Send me and not him or her’, we will take responsibility for our republic and not waver in these days that try our souls. “We’re surrounded by wickedness and fear and dithering and inaction. But that’s not our problem. Our problem is following your lead.” In the weeks before the Capitol attack, Mastriano was involved in failed attempts to overturn Trump’s defeat in Pennsylvania, the announcement of which confirmed Biden’s electoral college win. On the Zoom call, Mastriano displayed what he said were “letters that President Trump asked me this morning to send to [Senate Republican leader] Mitch McConnell and [House leader] Kevin McCarthy, outlining the fraud in Pennsylvania, and this will embolden them to stand firm and disregard what has happened in Pennsylvania until they have an investigation”. He also said: “We think about our elected officials in Pennsylvania who’ve been weak and feckless and we’ve handed over our power to a governor” – Tom Wolf, a Democrat – “who disregards the freedoms of this republic. “I pray that we’ll take responsibility, we’ll seize the power that we had given to us by the constitution, and as well by you providentially. I pray for the leaders and also in the federal government, God, on the 6th of January that they will rise up with boldness.” After the Capitol riot, when Congress reconvened, McCarthy was one of 138 Republican congressmen and nine senators who voted to object to results in Pennsylvania or Arizona or both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/dec/22/sunak-government-threatens-to-block-scottish-gender-recognition-law","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T23:08:32Z","webTitle":"Sunak government threatens to block Scottish gender recognition law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/22/sunak-government-threatens-to-block-scottish-gender-recognition-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/dec/22/sunak-government-threatens-to-block-scottish-gender-recognition-law","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak’s government is threatening to block a new law that would make Scotland the first part of the UK to introduce a self-identification system for people who want to change gender. In a significant escalation that brings tensions around transgender rights into the constitutional arena, Westminster made clear it would consider a “nuclear option” of blocking the bill from going for royal assent, a move that would enrage supporters of the changes and nationalists. The Scottish government pledged to “vigorously contest” any such intervention. The first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, called Sunak and his cabinet “democracy deniers” after the supreme court ruled in October that Holyrood could not legally hold another independence referendum without Westminster’s approval. The ruling has resulted in a polling boost for independence over the last month. The Scottish government hailed what it called “a historic day for equality” after a vote on Thursday afternoon in which MSPs overwhelmingly backed plans to make it easier and less intrusive for individuals to legally change their gender, and to extend the streamlined system for obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) to 16- and 17-year-olds. But immediately after the 86-39 vote, which followed three days of intense and at times emotional debate at Holyrood, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said: “We share the concerns that many people have regarding certain aspects of this bill, and in particular the safety issues for women and children. “We will look closely at that, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK-wide legislation, in the coming weeks – up to and including a section 35 order stopping the bill going for royal assent if necessary.” The women and equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, who met her Scottish government counterpart, Shona Robison, on Monday to discuss the bill, said following the vote that the Scottish government had “not addressed the full implications of their bill – especially on the lives of women and girls”. She added: “The UK government is now looking at provisions that can prompt reconsideration and allow MSPs to address these issues.” While gender recognition is a devolved matter, equalities legislation – which the new law will interact with – is reserved to Westminster. Jack’s intervention follows UK government briefings in the run-up to the vote that the new law would create “legal chaos” and result in “gender tourism” across the border with England. Section 35 of the Scotland Act allows the Scottish secretary to make an order prohibiting Holyrood’s presiding officer from submitting a bill for royal assent if they have reasonable grounds to believe it would have an adverse effect on the operation of the law as it applies to reserved matters. It is almost certain that such a move would be challenged by the Scottish government, either by judicial review or a direct reference to the supreme court, resulting in the second legal battle between the two governments in recent months. A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The bill as passed is within legislative competence, and was backed by an overwhelming majority, with support from all parties. Any attempt by the UK government to undermine the democratic will of the Scottish parliament will be vigorously contested by the Scottish government.” Westminster government law officers will further study the implications of the bill before any decision is made on the next step, with Jack’s threat to block royal assent seen as not inevitable but very much possible. “That’s the nuclear option, if you like,” one UK government source said. “The ideal, of course, is that we can point out to the Scottish government all the constitutional issues the bill creates as it stands, and they can amend it before it’s fully enacted. But we’re looking very seriously at all possibilities.” Immediately after the vote, a spokesperson for the Equality and Human Rights Commission called on the UK government to provide clarity on whether Scottish GRCs would be recognised in the rest of the UK. The constitutional dimension will amplify tensions around the bill, over which there was the biggest SNP backbench revolt in the party’s 15 years in power. As a mark of the tensions, the debate was disrupted minutes before the final vote by protesters in the public gallery. Nine SNP MSPs voted against their government, including Ash Regan, a former minister who quit in protest at a previous vote, but the bill passed comfortably with support from the Scottish Greens, Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats. Two Labour members – who were whipped to vote in favour – also rebelled, while three Tories, who were allowed a free vote, supported it. The bill passed in a specially extended session, six years after it was first mooted by Sturgeon, who has been a consistent and passionate supporter of the change. The bill followed two of the largest public consultations in the history of the Scottish parliament. Proposing the final version of the bill to parliament, Robison insisted that applying for a GRC under the new system would continue to be “a substantial and significant legal process”, with safeguards strengthened during the passage of the bill, and she said the bill “doesn’t change public policy … around provision of single-sex spaces and services”. She told MSPs: “Trans rights are not in competition with women’s rights and, as so often before, we can improve things for everyone when those discriminated against act as allies not opponents.” But the Scottish Conservatives’ equalities spokesperson, Rachael Hamilton, told Robison that her government had not brought the people of Scotland with them, and that “in the rush to make the process a little easier for trans people, the government is making it easier for criminal men to attack women”. During the third-stage amendment process, which ran to two marathon sessions ending after midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, Holyrood witnessed an unprecedented level of cross-party collaboration as members moved to address concerns about abusive males taking advantage of the new system. Vic Valentine, the manager of Scottish Trans, said the “simple but important” changes would allow trans people to live “with the dignity and recognition that everyone deserves”. They added: “Trans people across Scotland today will be feeling pleased and relieved that this bill has passed, after many years of difficult public debate that has often felt like people are talking about us and not to us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/15/australia-live-news-aukus-submarines-nuclear-economy-health-weather-housing-interest-rates-nsw-vic-qld","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T07:50:17Z","webTitle":"ABC staff to walk off job next week – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/15/australia-live-news-aukus-submarines-nuclear-economy-health-weather-housing-interest-rates-nsw-vic-qld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/15/australia-live-news-aukus-submarines-nuclear-economy-health-weather-housing-interest-rates-nsw-vic-qld","fields":{"bodyText":"And that is all for this evening.

Queensland Greens MP accuses committee of trying to ‘bury’ submission on youth crime Queensland Greens MP Michael Berkman has accused a parliamentary committee of attempting to “bury” a whistleblower’s submission during a heated debate on the state’s controversial youth crime laws. Watch house officer Steven Marshall’s submission to the state’s economic and governance committee detailed “human rights breaches” he claims he witnessed at Brisbane City watch house between 2018 and 2019. The submission – which was quickly removed from the parliament website – outlined shocking allegations such as “illegal strip searches”, adults exposing themselves to children and staff wrapping towels around prisoners’ heads to avoid spit hood protocols. Guardian Australia unsuccessfully sought a statement from the committee about why the submission was removed. Berkman tabled Marshall’s submission to parliament on Wednesday as he claimed the committee had chosen to “bury” it rather than “shining some light” on it. “I now table a copy of that submission so that it’s at least on the record in this debate,” he said. Queensland police confirmed on Tuesday they were reviewing claims outlined in the submission, noting it was published by the committee “very briefly and then withdrawn”. A police spokesperson said “an enquiry was made to the committee regarding the existence of submission 58 due to the QPS noting a discrepancy when cross-checking submissions against the list”. The state parliament is debating the youth crime bill this week, which includes making breach of bail an offence for children and expanding an electronic monitoring trial for children as young as 15. During the debate, Berkman was asked to leave the chamber before accusing the government of driving “a baseless, media driven response that suspends the Human Rights Act on four occasions to deny children their rights.” This is a disgraceful piece of legislation and I hope each and every one of these members of the government feels shame. Health minister Yvette D’Ath defended the government’s response, saying the laws were specifically targeted towards serious, repeat offenders. The Greens’... position, it ignores all of the investment [the] government has made and continues to make to try to change the direction of the young kids’ lives going forward.” What is really important is not just the time they spend in detention, but what we do to support them through the process ... and [that] wraparound support. David Pocock: money in housing future fund ‘won’t even touch the sides’ Labor’s housing future fund is the backdrop of debate as Senate crossbenchers and independents demand more ambition to tackle Australia’s housing crisis. Though the $10 billion proposal passed the lower house in February, Greens and independents in the Senate worry it doesn’t go far enough, AAP reports. The allocated money will finance 30,000 social and affordable homes in the first five years. But as a parliamentary committee examines plans for the fund’s implementation, independent senator David Pocock says the allocated money is “not going to even touch the sides”. He says the fund was on track to provide just 540 homes when there were 3,100 people on his jurisdiction’s social housing waiting list. It sounds like a lot of money but when you break that down into available payments to build and maintain social homes, that money runs out pretty quickly. The government will require the Greens’ vote to pass the bill – but they are calling for the removal of a $500 million annual spending cap, and for a minimum $5 billion to be invested every year. In a submission to the committee, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Housing Association also called on the government to clarify the rationale behind the $500m annual limit. Community Housing Industry Association chief executive officer Wendy Hayhurst recommended some tweaks but suggested the fund could be easily upscaled. While the initial housing targets are modest, the HAFF can be scaled over time with regular top-ups and this could become the source of ongoing dependable funding needed to make inroads into the shortfalls in social affordable rental housing. Workers in Australia’s Antarctic Division ‘left out of pocket’ The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) has lodged a dispute with the Fair Work Commission arguing many Antarctic expeditioners are owed thousands of dollars in unpaid meal allowances. Expeditioners from across the country are required to stay in hotels while they complete pre-departure training in Hobart. This usually takes two to four weeks, but shipping delays meant some staff stayed in hotels for three months late last year. Due to a housing shortage in Hobart, some expeditioners were given accommodation without kitchen facilities. The union said some staff received meal allowances while others did not. It alleges one person resorted to boiling eggs in a kettle. Here’s the statement from the CPSU’s Tasmanian regional secretary, Zac Batchelor: Workers in Australia’s Antarctic Division have been left out of pocket because of delays to expeditions that are out of their control, and their own employer’s refusal to appropriately support them during that time. If an expeditioner is recruited to do a job that requires training in a different location and the department organises and funds that travel, then that person is, as far as the union is concerned, travelling and entitled to the allowances that come with that. In the midst of an emerging recruitment and retention crisis, the last thing the AAD can afford to do right now is drain its own candidate pool. A Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water spokesperson declined to comment “as the matter is subject to legal proceedings”. The union said 301 expeditioners and head office staff have signed a petition calling on the department to pay uniform meal allowances to expeditioners. Another class action to be launched against AFL over concussion-related injuries AAP reports lead plaintiffs in the action include former Melbourne star Shaun Smith, Adelaide Crows premiership player Darren Jarman and the family of the late Shane Tuck. Griffins Lawyers will file legal papers in Victoria’s supreme court by Friday seeking damages after eight years of working on the case. Managing partner Greg Griffin says up to 300 players could join the action. Through no fault of the players, they’ve been damaged in many respects. There are many stories to be told, a lot of them aren’t very happy or pleasant, but they need to be told. An AFL spokesperson says the health and safety of its players is a top priority. The AFL takes concussion and the protection of the brain health of all those playing our game extremely seriously. The AFL has made more than 30 changes to tribunal guidelines and on-field rules over the past two decades to further protect the head and annually updates the concussion guidelines to improve the response to head knocks in our game in accordance with current and evolving science. Just a day earlier, Margalit Injury Lawyers lodged action seeking up to $1 billion in compensation from the AFL for players who sustained concussion-related injuries between 1985 and March 14 2023. The move comes after union members rejected a revised offer from management. The Community and Public Sector Union and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance held meetings on Wednesday and resolved that the sticking point is inadequate career pathways for ABC employees. ABC employees will stop work for an hour at 7am and 3pm on Wednesday 22 March. A planned strike was called off last week after ABC managing director David Anderson put forward a revised offer. Queensland Greens introduce climate transition bill A Greens proposal would see Queensland fossil fuel exports end in less than a decade in an effort to cut the state’s carbon emissions, AAP reports. MP Michael Berkman tabled a bill in state parliament yesterday to set up an independent authority to work on a transition plan with coal and gas workers, including a job-for-job guarantee and free re-skilling. Berkman says the state government doesn’t account for exported fossil fuels in its emissions data, but they still contribute to climate change in Queensland: When we take into account our coal and gas exports, Australia’s absolute carbon footprint is among the highest in the world, roughly equal with Russia. It’s a great shame that Queensland, identified as a potential leader in green steel manufacturing by experts ... is already falling behind on this. NSW fire weather warning The NSW Bureau of Meteorology has issued an extreme fire danger forecast for the Southern Ranges and Central Ranges districts going into Thursday. Full points for ‘credibility and transparency’ New misinformation firm NewsGuard gives the ABC, the Australian and Guardian Australia full points on “credibility and transparency”.

Search on for youths who allegedly mistreated penguins Authorities are investigating claims several young people mistreated little penguins on the foreshore of Burnie in Tasmania, AAP reports. An onlooker called the police at 6:30pm on Sunday after witnessing the incident. One penguin is being cared for by a vet and will undergo surgery due to its injuries. The Burnie foreshore is home to colonies of penguins, and holds dusk tours between October and March as the birds return from feeding at sea. In 2018 a man bludgeoned six little penguins to death at Sulphar Creek, just ten minutes away from Burnie. He was sentenced to 49 hours of community service. Tasmania’s Parks and Wildlife Service is investigating the recent incident, and Tasmania Police sergeant Ben Elliot said police are “seeking public assistance”: Police are seeking public assistance to identify those involved, particularly a young female who was carrying a distinctive, brightly coloured backpack. We are urging anyone with information about the incident, including the identity of the youths, to contact police. Safeguard mechanism explained For anyone wanting to catch up on what the safeguard mechanism is – and don’t we all – this explainer is a place to start: This piece gives some more up-to-date information about the sticking points in the negotiations between the government and the Senate crossbench: Greens back independents’ push for fixed cap on emissions Adam Bandt is backing a push by independent MPs for the Albanese government to introduce a fixed “cap” on carbon dioxide emissions under its planned changes to the safeguard mechanism to ensure industrial pollution does not keep increasing. In a speech to the Australia Institute tonight, the Greens leader will say that Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall and other crossbenchers were right to call for steps to ensure emissions under the scheme came down. Spender and David Pocock have backed a limit. Steggall has backed introducing an explicit legal objective that emissions should decline. The government says the scheme will avoid 205m tonnes by 2030 by requiring most major polluting industrial facilities to cut emissions intensity by 4.9% a year, starting in July. Critics say this is not guaranteed because the government has not proposed limits on how many new coal and gas developments can open or the number of carbon offsets that companies can buy to meet their emissions obligations. Bandt’s speech largely focuses on the Greens’ campaign for new coal and gas projects to be banned. He will say his party is “not asking for the perfect, just the bare minimum”. We’re not going to get everything we want, we understand that ... If Labor wants our support then they need to decide how desperate they are to keep opening up new coal and gas mines. Simple as that. Speaking at a media conference earlier today, the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said he and the Greens were talking about the safeguard mechanism design, but he was “not in discussions with the Greens through the media”. As I’ve indicated many times, I’m more than happy to have good faith discussions ... Those discussions have been, and will be, in keeping with our mandate and our agenda, and they’ll continue in coming days.” The legislation will be back before parliament next week. Queensland MP Rob Katter says $180 handouts for flood victims ‘almost an insult’ As river levels peaked and monsoon rains drenched Katter’s north-west electorate of Traeger, homes, businesses, farms, roads and ports are left with damage costing millions. Residents airlifted to safety earlier this week are still unable to return to their homes, with police telling locals to avoid floodwaters after crocodile sightings, AAP reports. The QLD state government is offering up to $180 grants for individuals or $900 for families, but Katter says that amount is “almost an insult”. We’re used to looking after ourselves in the gulf, and if the government’s not gonna look after us we’ll have after ourselves. It’s a shame it’s come to that but people are crying out for help up there. There’s a lot of mental distress at the moment because you’ve lost everything and 180 bucks is not even gonna buy groceries for the week. Paul Keating on Aukus – video recap Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating savaged his own party for signing up to the Aukus submarine deal at the National Press Club today. He called the Aukus press event held in the US with Anthony Albanese, Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak “kabuki theatre,” said one of the “principle problems” of the deal was that “defence has overtaken foreign policy” and attacked foreign minister Penny Wong for “running around the Pacific Islands with a lei around your neck handing out money”. Here’s the video recap if you missed his zingers in the blog earlier today: How would you spend Australian tax dollars? Government spending is always contentious – every choice is highly political. Australia has unveiled a plan to acquire a fleet of up to eight nuclear-powered submarines, to cost up to $58bn over the next 10 years. But what else could the money be spent on? Nick Evershed, Andy Ball and Amy Remeikis have an interactive that lets you play treasurer. Test out your spendings and savings measures here: Greens MP Sue Higginson says the successful appeal of Violet Coco – a climate protestor imprisoned for blocking one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a truck – is a “victory and vindication” that the law was “unjust and cruel”. The personal costs borne by Violet and other peaceful activists like her are extreme. The cost to our democracy is now in full view and we should all be concerned. Higginson said both the NSW Coalition and Labor created a “moral panic” in response to climate activist protests and “rushed anti-protest laws through parliament”. Moral panic in response to the fundamental right to protest is dangerous to democracy. It causes unrestrained police and magistrate behaviour and that is what we have experienced. It is straight from a criminology textbook; it is dangerous and it is not the mark of a mature democracy. The Greens will challenge the next parliament to review and repeal these anti-protest laws and to ensure that members of the community who engage in peaceful protest and nonviolent civil disobedience are not sentenced to prison terms. Nearly a third of 107 homeless people who died in Perth last year were Aboriginal One hundred and seven people died while homeless or after recently experiencing homelessness in Perth last year, nearly a third of whom were Aboriginal people, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. Advocates fronted the ongoing inquiry into the financial administration of homelessness services in Western Australia this morning to speak about their work helping people experiencing homelessness or dealing with the public housing system. In the hearing today, longtime advocate Dr Betsy Buchanan and campaigner Jesse Noakes from House the Homeless WA revealed the new data from Home2Health, the first organisation to comprehensively track homelessness-related deaths in the state, beginning in 2020. The 107 deaths are an increase on the previous two years, and focus only on the Perth metropolitan area. Fifty-six people in Perth died while homeless in 2020, and 70 people the following year. The matter of evictions of Aboriginal people from public housing, which Guardian Australia has written about previously, was also raised, with new data released by the WA department of communities showing that more than half the households evicted from public housing in WA are Aboriginal families. Of the 256 evictions that took place last year, 129 involved Aboriginal tenants. Last year, the Guardian revealed that Noongar man John Abraham had made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission against the WA Housing Authority after he received a “without grounds” termination notice, commonly called a no-grounds eviction notice from his public housing property. The WA Department of communities claimed this morning that a reduction of 90% in public housing evictions had occurred during the McGowan Labor government’s time in office, with housing minister John Carey saying people who left public housing properties following termination notices or court orders were not evictions “as they are not final”. Carey said: Right up until the point where there is an eviction, and the locks are changed, tenants still have the opportunity to change their behaviour and engage with the Department of Communities to sustain their tenancy. That 90% figure and characterisation of the eviction data is rejected by advocates. Three-year-old dies on NSW south coast A three-year-old has died after being struck by a ride-on lawn mower on NSW’s far south coast on Saturday, the ABC reports. The child was taken to Pambula District hospital with severe injuries. Police were called to the hospital at about 12:30pm, but said the toddler could not be saved. NSW Ambulance has confirmed paramedics attended the incident. Both the South Pambula property and hospital are now crime scenes. A report is being prepared for the coroner, and investigations re ongoing. Albanese in Fiji On the way home from Aukus talks in the US prime minister Anthony Albanese drops into Fiji to visit prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka for the first time. The trip is one of many in the Asia-Pacific as Albanese assures regional leaders that Australia joining the nuclear-powered submarine deal is not a “serious proliferation risk” as put by China. Thanks Natasha May for carrying today’s blog! If you spot something you don’t want us to miss this evening, you can Tweet it my way @At_Raf_ Thanks for following what continued to be a very busy day on the blog following the big Aukus announcement. That’s it from me, Rafqa Touma now has the blog! Dutton: We do not need to ‘cannibalise defence’ to pay for Aukus Dutton says he does not want money taken out of the defence budget to pay for Aukus, in a move he says would be tantamount to “cannibalising” defence: The final point is that the last thing we should allow Labor to do is to cannibalise the Australian Defence Force like they did when they were lost in government. They forget that in the 2014 budget only a decade ago Labor decide to cut defence spending in real terms by 10.5 %. It reduces spending back to 1.56% GDP, which is the lowest level since 1938. When we were in government we restored integrity to the defence budget. Many women in uniform recognise that stop me constantly to thank me for it. There were defence families who lost their jobs and missed out on opportunities when Labor was last in government. We need to fund but we do not need to cannibalise defence to do it. The government needs to be upfront about how they going to pay for the Aukus commitment so it is essential that we get that capability and we are strongly supporting the government in that regard. The government needs to answer questions about how it is they going to pay for it and I do not want to see money ripped out of army or air force or navy to pay for the Aukus deal. If there are problems in programs or monies not being spent appropriately, that is the government’s claim, then make that public. But if you’re just going into defence, taking billions of dollars away from the men and women in uniform to try and fund the Aukus program and as the treasurer says this could be a cost-neutral program, no one believes that. It is not credible. The Labor party will have to detail that in the budget in May. Dutton asked if there should be changes to the NDIS to pay for this 100bn, $200bn Dutton: The report of quotes in relation to aged care – my argument was more money needs to be spent in aged care and if there is a structural change that requires legislation to make our aged care system more sustainable, getting more money to the system to give people greater dignity, then that we would support that. In relation to the NDIS, the NDIS is an important system for the people with disabilities and we need to make sure that there is a sustainable system. Bill Shorten has spoken about lots of money has been misspent within the NDIS. I don’t want to see that. I want to see the money spent on people most in need, those the most profound disabilities … My argument is if there is a waste, and the Labor party is arguing that there is waste elements to different programs, then it is the responsibility of any government, of any treasurer, to make sure that the taxpayers money is being spent efficiently. In helping those families who are most in need, stopping rorts where they are happening across every government program, and by doing that, they can provide support to the money that they are spending on defence. Dutton: ‘how is it all going to be paid for? While Dutton says he’s entirely behind the Aukus deal, he still wants Australians to question Labor over the price tag: So there will be lots of questions reasonably that Australians will have to ask Labor over the coming months, right up to the budget and beyond, how is it all going to be paid for? If you are seeing an increase in your electricity bill it is because of the policy that Labor has in place. If you are seeing an increase in your interest rates, higher than what they otherwise need to be, it is because Labor’s policies have been fuelling inflation which feeds into high interest rates. If you have a look at all sorts of bills that you pay when you go to the cafe, doesn’t matter whether it is the local restaurant, doesn’t matter whether it’s the local IGA, all those input costs under Labor goes up. And this is what happens we have a Labor government. They mismanage the economy, the pull the wrong levers. Families and small businesses end up paying the price and there is a big price to pay when there is a Labor government. It is very similar to what happened in the 1980s and is very similar to what happened with Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, it is history repeating itself. When we get a change of government and Labor is elected, people get that you change the country, as Paul Keating once said and he is exactly right, and under Mr Albanese you are paying more for every item in your grocery basket, you pay more for your electricity, certainly, more than you need to and that is a real problem. Asked about whether Keating’s comments reveal if Aukus could be driving a wedge between Labor’s left and right factions, Dutton says there is division in the Labor party. But he is calling on the defence minister, Richard Marles, to publicly rebuke the former Labor prime minister’s comments. There is clearly division within the Labor party, there is no question about that. There is on nuclear waste – on that element of the Aukus deal that undercurrent has always been there. The hard left with the Labor party which Mr Albanese led for years and years, they have a real hesitation, a real doubt and no doubt that has been expressed by Paul Keating. There are of course people, including Jim Chalmers and Richard Marles himself, who make great claim to the relationship, the mentoring relationship that they have with Paul Keating. They busily meet with him regularly. If Paul Keating is prepared to say this in public, what is he saying to senior Labor members in private? And I think it is incumbent upon Richard Marles and others to come out today to rebuke the unhinged comments of Mr Keating because they should be taking the advice of the military and intelligence chiefs as opposed to Paul Keating. Dutton is asked if Keating’s comments are a threat to national security Dutton: I think most Australians will look to the advice of those experts who are contemporary, who understand the intelligence and who are acting on it, and the government is acting on the advice of intelligence and the military chiefs, the advice they have from their partners, and this is a necessary investment for us. Mr Keating loves a wild phrase but in the end our job is to keep Australians safe and I think we give our country the best chance of peace and security and our region the best chance of peace into the decades through the deal. Peter Dutton on Aukus: ‘We went with the advice of defence chiefs and the intelligence agencies, not Paul Keating’ The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is defending the Aukus deal following comments from Paul Keating at the National Press Club labelling it Labor’s “worst international decision” since conscription. Speaking in Melbourne in front of posters for Roshena Campbell, the Liberal candidate in the Aston byelection, Dutton says: The deal between United States and the United Kingdom is a coalition that we had in mind that nuclear subs would be a great deterrence to any attacks on our country – that is the advice of the chiefs of the intelligence agencies as well. We went with the advice of defence chiefs and the intelligence agencies, not Paul Keating. The Aukus deal was possible because of the negotiations … The best chance that we have of preserving peace in our region, which is what we all want, is not to be in a position of weakness but to work closely with our partners, and we do exactly that through Aukus. Curtin Uni to meet with union to discuss new enterprise bargaining agreement Curtin University will meet with the union on Thursday to discuss a new enterprise bargaining agreement following industrial action this week. Hundreds of staff went on strike for three hours at the Western Australian university on Tuesday, in an escalation of a long-running campaign for better pay and conditions. A spokesperson for the university’s management said it had already advised staff they had recommended the bargaining process after their latest agreement was overwhelmingly rejected. [We] will provide fresh offers to the NTEU on a number of issues, including salary. These will be discussed when we meet this Thursday. The University remains committed to good faith discussions and a quick and positive resolution to the renewed process. Curtin University supports those staff who are NTEU members exercising their legal rights to take protected industrial action. Following the action, which resulted in dozens of classes being cancelled or postponed, union staff committed to more strike action in coming weeks unless management improved its current offer. Negotiations began in July 2022, with staff rejecting an offer for a 2.2% pay rise over five years, below WA’s inflation rate of 7.8%. The union has requested a pay increase of 5% per year. In a video, National Tertiary Education Union Curtin branch president, Scott Fitzgerald, said the offer was an “insult” to staff, citing a $113m surplus recorded by the university last year. Major issues have emerged around manageable workloads ... salaries, secure employment ... students are wise enough to know that their learning conditions are based upon staff working conditions. They know if their lecturer is insecure, doesn’t have time to prepare, is concerned about meeting cost of living pressure, they’re not going to have the learning experience they desire and deserve. Billionaires Cannon-Brookes and Forrest face rival bidders for Sun Cable The voluntary administrators of the company billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest set up to power Singapore, Darwin and points in between with a giant solar farm say they have enticed “strong interest” for the struggling venture. The sale process for Sun Cable has indeed received interest from multiple parties. The administrators now intend to finalise a list of bidders by the end of May. “The shortlisted bidders include a range of potential buyers including parties that are not existing Sun Cable shareholders,” they said, implying that MCB and Twiggy have some competition. The sale process has advertised Sun Cable “as a complete development”, including the undersea AAPowerlink to stretch from the Northern Territory to Singapore with a stop or two likely in Indonesia - should it go ahead. Here are more details on the ambitions of the project before it went into voluntary administration: Guess we’ll have to see if Sun Cable is unsinkable. The press club interview with Keating has wrapped up now and the opposition leader Peter Dutton is speaking in Melbourne. I’ll bring you some updates from my colleagues before letting you know what Dutton is saying (hint: he doesn’t agree with Keating). Keating goes on to say the Albanese government has “no mandate” for the Aukus deal: I think that there will be a big reaction to what the government is doing. There’s no mandate inside the Labor party. No mandate for what Prime Minister Albanese, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Richard Marles are doing. No mandate. Keating asked about Labor’s normalisation of relationship with China despite Aukus Guardian Australia’s Paul Karp asks: Despite the Albanese government’s support for Aukus, it does appear to have made progress normalising the relationship with China. Could I please ask is that worth anything? And does that show that a productive, economic and political relationship is possible despite Aukus? Keating: Mate, you’d have to be naive to be thinking that, wouldn’t you. Look, what I said in the speech I’ll try to find it. I said ... ‘No mealy-mouthed talk of stabilisation or resort to soft or polite language will disguise from the Chinese the extent and intent of our commitment to the United States hegemony in east Asia with all its deadly portents.’ So in other words, they’re not going to be as rude as Scott Morrison. They’re not going to be as rude as Marise Payne. They’ll talk softly. But by the way, we’ll put the last shackle in the chain to contain you. And China will say - Oh, thanks. Thanks for that, I’m glad you’re speaking to us more nicely. Keating asked about China’s treatment of Uyghurs Matthew Knott from the Sydney Morning Herald asks: You have a tremendous skill for invective and criticism. Could I ask you to turn some of that to the Chinese Communist party and its treatment of Uyghurs, for example? Its treatment of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong? Will you be similarly critical of them as you are of people in your own party and journalists? Keating responds being highly critical of the Sydney Morning Herald’s reporting but when Laura Tingle directs the former PM back to the question of the Uyghurs he has this to say: I’m not going to defend China about the Uyghurs. There’s disputes about what the nature of the Chinese affront to the Uyghurs are. There’s dispute about that. What if the Chinese said - what about deaths in custody of Aboriginal people in your prison system? Wouldn’t that be a valid point for them? Wouldn’t it be a valid point? In other words, great power diplomacy cannot be about reaching down into the low social entrails of these states any more than they can with us. Keating: ‘I’m not doing super today’ Jess Malcolm from the Australian attempts to ask Keating about his view on the changes to super, but he’s not going there. This is all about Aukus. I’m not doing super today. I mean, I’ve done super since I was a kid. Keating: What would be the point of China wanting to occupy Sydney and Melbourne? Olivia Caisley from Sky News has this question for Keating: You’ve described foreign minister Penny Wong and defence minister Richard Marles as seriously unwise in this nine-page document. Unlike present players, you haven’t received a briefing on the issue since the mid-1990s. Could you be out of touch on this issue? And given you didn’t foresee the military build-up from China, as well as intimidation of neighbouring countries, when you were in office, what makes you so sure China isn’t a military threat to Australia? To which Keating produces this zinger: Because I’ve got a brain. Principally. And I can think. And I can read. And I read every day. I mean, why would China want to threaten ... What would be the point? They get the iron ore, the coal, the wheat. What would be the point of China wanting to occupy Sydney and Melbourne? Militarily? And could they ever do it? Could they ever bring the numbers here? It would be an armada of troop ships to do it. So you don’t need a briefing from the dopey security agencies that we have in Canberra to tell you that. I mean, I know you’re trying to ask a question, but the question is so dumb, it’s hardly worth an answer. Keating on threat of Chinese cyber-attacks: ‘Who in the world is not into cyber-attacks?’ Probyn goes on to ask Keating about the threat of a cyber-attack and the former PM’s response turns up a great Keatingism warning that all “security agency ning-nongs” participate in cyber-attacks. He cites the example of the Indonesian phone tapping incident, which was an exclusive Guardian Australia’s editor Lenore Taylor along with Ewen MacAskill brought to you in 2013. Keating: You think that the Americans and the Russians are not into cyber-attacks? Who in the world is not into cyber-attacks? Or do you think that we are not? Just remember this - the best friend we had in Asia was a former president of Indonesia, Yudhoyono. He was the best guy we had barracking for us. Those dopes in Asis tapped his telephone and that of his wife. Tapped his phone. I mean, this is what states get up to if you let these security agencies, ning-nongs, take control. But you can’t impute, as your question imputes, that tariffs on wine or barley is equivalent to an invasion of the country. China does not threaten Australia. Has not threatened Australia. Does not intend to threaten Australia. You can have all of the commercial rows you like - we can have diplomatic. Remember, this all happened after Marise Payne – you know, the great non-minister of our time - went on the Insiders program and said we were going to have weapons-type inspections of Wuhan to find out what was the cause of the virus. It was out of that came all of this. So you can’t put a question without contexting it, mate! I mean, contextualisation may not be your long suit, but that’s what you should be doing. Keating: ‘You can’t impute threat meaning invasion from putting a tariff on wine’ Keating is saying Chinese tariffs on Australian products constitute “friction of international politics” but cannot be considered a threat. ABC’s Andrew Probyn: You said before that China has not threatened Australia. But how do you reconcile that with the fact that they have issued sanctions on coal, timber, wine, lobster, barley, Australian products. That there has been a debt diplomacy employed among the Pacific neighbours. An encroachment of the South China Sea. An effective annexation of some islands. A huge military ramp-up that Laura asked you about. How is this not, as one Biden official said this week, undeclared economic and commercial boycott of Australia? Keating: A threat to Australia is a military threat. A military threat. It’s a threat for the army of the People’s Republic of China to come and occupy Australia. That’s what a threat is. Like, for instance, a similar threat would be if someone went to occupy Tasmania on us. That’s what a threat is. Commercial reactions on things like you mentioned - they’re not strategic. They’re not a threat. I mean, look what we’re doing to them in the WTO and all of steel dumping and all the rest of our stuff. I mean, in the friction of international politics, these things turn up. But they’re not threats. You can’t impute threat meaning invasion, with putting a tariff on wine. Or maybe you’re silly enough to think that? Do you think that you are silly enough to think that? Keating: ‘If it all turns badly, it will be just like Afghanistan and Iraq - the Americans will pull out and leave the mess behind’ Keating: The Chinese don’t want to attack anybody. They don’t want to attack us and they don’t want to attack the Americans and they don’t want to attack the Indonesians. What is all of this? It is about one matter only. The maintenance of US strategic hegemony in Asia. If the US has no continental land in east Asia, how does it suspect or argue that it can remain the strategic superpower? Because if it all turns badly, it will be just like Afghanistan and Iraq - the Americans will pull out and leave the mess behind. They will just go back to San Diego, 10,000km, and leave us with the consequences. That would be the outcome. “An 8,000t submarine is going to be visible in a second” As the floor is opened for questions, Phil Coorey from the AFR is the first up: Richard Marles, perhaps in anticipation of your comments today, in defending yesterday’s announcement said, “we have witnessed in the region, single biggest conventional buildup anywhere in the world since the end of the second world war. To not respond to that is to be condemned by history.” Can I ask you to clarify? Do you think that we should not respond to it at all? Or we’re responding in wrong way? Keating: We’re responding in the wrong way. The Collins class boat which are, which I built with Kim Beazley, was a boat designed in the defence of Australia. It was designed to protect the continental lands of Australia and to repel any invasion of us. What these boats are, and this is what I don’t think the defence minister is telling you, is that these boats are designed to sit off the continental shelf of China and sink American nuclear weapons capable submarines. Let’s make this point. About 100 miles off the Chinese coast, there’s a plateau. A very shallow plateau. Very shallow plateau. Any American nuclear armed subs have got to get across the plateau before they get into deep water. So the Americans said – ah, we could have like ducks in a shooting gallery, we will shoot them out before they can get to the deep water. But, in the Chinese shallow water, the Chinese have it absolutely loaded with sensors and with equipment to detect large submarines. An 8,000t submarine is going to be visible in a second when the Chinese come across it. So our submarines are going to be susceptible. Our submarines are going to be in the peripheral waters of China, where the platforms and sensors are most concentrated. So while the Americans think that they can shoot Chinese submarines like ducks in a barrel. The Chinese can also shoot our submarines because we’re in the shallow water and we are detectible. So this is a strange way to be defending Australia have your submarines sunk on the Chinese continental shelf, chasing Chinese submarines, whereas in fact, with the Collins model, you had, and if the numbers are right, 45 or 50 conventional submarines around the coast of Australia saying – put a step over here and we’ll punch your lights out. That’s the better defence policy for Australia than joining with the Americans up there in the shallow waters of the Chinese coast. Keating: China is more intent on expanding its influence west than east Tingle: What’s your view of China’s ambitions to the west in the Stans given the incredibly rich payload? Keating: I told you this on our last program, last time we met here. China’s interests are not in the east. See, Australia and the US think – ‘oh, the Chinese, they’re going to muck around with the Philippines. They’re interested in the east.’ No, no, what they’re interested in the east is to keep the front doormat clean. They’re really interested in the west. The west of China and into the Stan countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and these countries, which I believe they’ll have major influence in all the way up to Istanbul. Developed countries like Australia are about 90% urbanised – Germany, France, US. China is 55%. It’s got another 35 to go. And it’s got the Stan countries. So China’s growth is just going to keep on coming. And as you know, they’ve got an agreement to take railways and roads up to Poland. So here’s the Americans … I mean, they’ve always been protected by the two oceans. But now, for the Americans, the Pacific and Atlantic are a corset. They’re a corset on them. They’ve got nowhere to go. They’re protected, but they’ve got nowhere to go. But the Chinese have got lots of places to go. “They’re not attacking anyone” Tingle: But you have said, nonetheless, that China doesn’t have any territorial ambitions. Why do you need such a big land army, such a big navy? Keating: The land army of China is really part of the police force of the place, really. It’s like a paramilitary type. Same as Indonesia. China is locked into a bowl. They’ve got Siberia to the north. The Himalayas to the west. Indo-China to the south. They don’t go anywhere. They’re not attacking anyone. All they’ve done is militarised the shores in the South China Sea but that’s all about, as the American Defence Department says, “Restricting the United States from having a presence in China’s periphery.” In other words, until this happened, the US Seventh fleet used to patrol up along the territorial sea of China six miles off the coast. The Chinese said, we’re not having this any more. We don’t want to be rude, but we don’t have to put up with this any more. China’s defence spending to GDP ratio only 40% of US, Keating says Tingle asks Keating if he has been surprised by the way the Chinese have developed their military in the last five years? It’s been an exponential growth in the spend. Keating: Their defence spending to GDP is only a third of that – 40% of that – of the United States. They are bigger, so 40% of bigger is more. But it’s nothing like the United States. The United States spends more than the next 10 countries behind it. Tingle: Why are they doing it? Keating: Why are they? They are doing it because A – they have a huge economy which is internationally dependant. And because, they have this sort of pressure from the US. And so, like every state, the IMF says on the purchasing power basis, China is 20% larger than the US. So what do they want them to do? Have little toy destroyers in the bath. Like little boys in the bath. They could muck around little boats in the bath. Would that suit the Americans? Keating denies having any commercial interests in China Keating says he wants to address accusations that he has had commercial interest in China, denying any commercial interest “whatsoever”: They talk about me on China development. I was on China development. By the way, I left five years ago. I was on the China Bank Development Bank board for 13 years, and ten years as chairman with Henry Kissinger and with Paul Vaulker, and the former director of the IMF. And you know what our fee was? $5,000 a year. $5,000. They didn’t even call it a fee. They called it an honourarium. I have no commercial interest in China whatsoever. In other words, I sat as an Australian representative … hoping I was doing a great thing for Australia. And taking it back to the Central Bank here. Disposal of nuclear waste is a “minor issue” – Keating Keating says the issue of Australia being responsible for a nuclear dump is a “minor issue” with the bigger issue being the influence of the US over the Aukus decision. Tingle: One of the things that we weren’t expecting out of yesterday’s announcement which we did get was the revelation that we’re going to hold on to the uranium and have to find a storage for it after the submarines, the hypothetical submarines reach the end of their life. What is your take on that? And in particular, what the imputation is for non-proliferation? Keating: I don’t think that burying spent fuel rods is proliferation. And Australia is big enough for that. It’s a minor issue. The bigger issue is this – I’ll read this to you. Every year, the United States Department of Defence has a statutory responsibility of a report to the Congress. And in November of 2022, in its report, the Defence Department said this: “The People’s Republic of China aims to restrict the United States from having a presence in China’s periphery.” In other words not having our ships run up and down their coast. That’s what it really means. “This says something about the left in Australia” Keating goes on about how Labor has continued the Coalitions’s relationship with Aspi (the Australian Strategic Policy Institute). Because Morrison made clear and the Australian newspaper made clear at the weekend, the foreign minister wasn’t consulted. The people consulted were the [Office of National Assessments] people and Aspi. Wouldn’t you think the first thing a Labor government would do is knock all their heads off? … They’d been brought in. I mean, this says something about the left in Australia. Politically in the Labor party, I fought the left most of my life. Always mostly on behalf of the United States. But the two principle people on the left in Australia are now Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong. And what they’ve done – they have essentially accommodated the strategic wishes of the United States, uncritically. Uncritically. This is the left. Labor was too quick to back Aukus, says Keating Laura Tingle: So, how do you think this came about? You’ve talked a bit about the fact in your statement about the fact that Labor came out and supported the Morrison Government’s proposition 24 hours after it of made. Is this because Labor doesn’t feel that it can move on national security? Keating gives us his take on how it is Labor came to support the Aukus policy in the first place: What happened, Penny Wong got the job five or six years ago and she decided that with Bill Shorten at the time that there should be no opening for the Liberal party to attack Labor on strategic policy. So, she folded in with Julie Bishop and then subsequently Marise Payne. There wasn’t a bit of difference with them … She was not going to rustle one leaf or see Labor go into an election campaign with strategic issues banging about. So it was the smallest small target policy. What happens after five years of this, finally, that wilful Morrison comes up, run by all the spooks in Canberra … says we have a better idea and let’s get rid of the French submarines and why don’t we get the US ones? And so, with no notice to the Labor party, they call them in, at 4.00pm one afternoon and see Albanese, Wong and Richard Marles and at 10.00am the following morning, they’ve taken the policy in its entirety in its board. And the prime minister was saying recently I was very proud to take that policy in 24 hours. Well, how would you take a policy which is going to cost this much money, have these consequences for our relations A – with China, with the region. B – in terms of our industrial base. How would you do this in 24 hours? You can only do it if you have no perceptive ability to understand the weight of the decisions you’re being asked to make. Keating says eight submarines for $360bn is ‘worst deal in history’ Keating expounds why he believes the value for money is the “worst deal in all history”: Look, I’d say for the cost – $360bn – for $360bn, we’re going to get eight submarines. It must be the worst deal in all history. But let’s say $360bn. If we were buying Collins class replacements, we’d get at least 40 to 50 of those submarines. 40 to 50 for the same price. Now, no navy has ever done better than having one-third of their boats at sea at any one time. So we would have … Let’s call it 45 to make it simple or something like that. We’d have a third of them, say 15, at sea. 15 at sea, against three nuclear boats. Fifteen against three! Now, remember, the nuclear boats [are] only firing a traditional torpedo. It’s not firing a nuclear torpedo, just like the other boats. And because it’s 8,000 tonnes – that’s big – they’re discoverable. They’ll be discoverable from space. And what’s more, they are too big for the shallow waters of Australian coast. A 4,000t boat like the Collins worked perfectly in the Australian coast because it was designed to protect Australia. It wasn’t designed to sit off the Chinese coast seeking Chinese submarines. So now we’ve got a big 8,000t clunker. We get three instead of 15. Keating: Defence pact with UK is ‘deeply pathetic’ for Australia Laura Tingle puts it to Keating that the Albanese government has improved the relationship with China since it has come to office. Keating says that as the UK attempts to put together a global Britain in the aftermath of Brexit, it has taken advantage of Australia’s accomodating stance: Look, they’ve decided not to speak rudely or loudly, but at core, you can see what the outcome is. There’s Anthony Albanese signing up with the American and the British. Let’s remember about the British – they pulled their grand fleet out of east Asia in 1904. They witnessed the capitulation of Singapore in 1942. They then announced their east of Suez policy in 1968. In other words, you’re all on your own, you Australians, we’re leaving! … And then in 1973, just to make sure we got the message they said, bugger you we’re going into Europe so no wheat, no wool. After the great problem of Brexit … destroyed their place in Europe, it took two world wars to drag Britain to the centre of Europe to sit beside Germany as a second major power. So they’re going to put together global Britain. So they’re looking around for suckers. Suckers! … And they found – oh, here’s a bunch of accommodating people in Australia. An accommodating prime minister, a conservative defence minister, a risk-averse foreign minister. Let’s put a proposition to them! So here we are, 230 years – 230 years – after we left Britain, we are returning to the Cornwall where Morrison did this deal, and now Rishi Sunak, for Australia to find our security in Asia. I mean, how deeply pathetic is that? Keating says one of the “principle problems” of the Aukus deal is that “defence has overtaken foreign policy.” I mean, you don’t see Penny Wong out there. You see Richard Marles out there, not Penny Wong. So what’s happened is that the military have overtaken the foreign policy, as a consequence, we’re not using diplomacy. Let me just make this point. Running around the Pacific Islands with a lei around your neck handing out money, which is what Penny does, is not foreign policy. It’s a consular task. Foreign policy is what you do with the great powers. What you do with China. What you do with the United States. This government, the Albanese government, does not employ foreign policy. “China is a lonely state” Keating says the problem with China is manufactured: China is a lonely state. That’s the truth of it. They would fall over themselves having a proper relationship with us. Fall over themselves. We supply their iron ore which keeps their really industrial base going. And there’s nowhere else but us to get it. You know, we’ve provided them We provide all sorts of things and investment and what have you. They are 12 flying hours from us. We have a continent of our own. A border with no one. No border disputes with them. Perfect! No, no, we’ve manufactured a problem. You know, don’t let the sleeping dogs lie. We’re giving the old dog a kicking! “It is not the old Soviet Union” Keating says China is not like the old Soviet Union and should not be treated as such: So you’ve got to remember this about China. We’re speaking of it as though it’s almost like the old Soviet Union. It is not the old Soviet Union. It is in the IMF. It’s in the World Bank. It’s in the WTO. It’s in the WHO. You know, Xi Jinping, at Davos five years ago talking in favour of globalisation. This is not a state which wishes to overturn the west. But there’s a whole lot of difference between not wishing to overturn the west and copping the nonsense from the Americans that the Chinese should live forever under their strategic command. Keating says land invasion from China is impossible Keating is speaking about why he believes the idea underlying threat from China has to be untrue because it can only apply to a land invasion, which he says is “impossible.” The only way the Chinese could threaten Australia or attack it is on land. That is, they bring an armada of troop ships with a massive army to invade us. This is not possible for the Chinese to do. Because you would need an armada of troop ships and they’d need to come with 13 days of steaming, 8,000km between Beijing, or Shanghai and Brisbane, say. In which case, we’d just sink them all. See, the moment they leave their port, they are visible straight away. Remember this - the allies succeeded in Normandy because, as a maritime assault, because there was an industrial state 21 miles away - Britain. There were no radar. And there was cloud cover. So in bad cover, we slipped those wharfs on to the beaches of Normandy and got away with it. It is impossible today with satellites. It is impossible with this sort of coverage. So what would happen is, we wouldn’t need submarines to sink an armada, and an armada of Chinese boats, ships, troop ships. We’d just do it with planes. And missiles. You know, the idea that we need American submarines to protect us, if we buy eight, three are at sea. Three are going to protect us from the might of China. Really! I mean, the rubbish of it, the rubbish. In other words, let me say this - China has not threatened us, and despite five years of this China threat appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald … it’s untrue. “The Chinese have never implied that they would threaten us” Why does Keating believe the Aukus deal “breaks” Labor’s winning streak on international decisions? Because underlying all of this stuff about the need for nuclear is the idea that China has threatened us or will threaten us. Now, this is a distortion and it’s untrue. The Chinese have never implied that they would threaten us or said it explicitly. But what “threaten us” means is an invasion of Australia. It doesn’t mean firing a few missiles off the coast like the Japanese submarines did in 1943, firing a few things into the eastern suburbs of Sydney. It means an invasion. All great battles are fought on land. Paul Keating makes Aukus criticism in National Press Club speech Our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, already brought you the statement from Paul Keating ahead of his address to the National Press Club. He’s called the Aukus submarine deal the worst international decision by an Australian Labor government since the former leader Billy Hughes sought to introduce conscription in the first world war. He’s now taken to the podium at the national press club explaining why he believes Aukus is a mistake: Labor has gotten all of the big ones basically right in the 20th century. They got it right knocking Hughes off over conscription. Curtin got it right in knocking Churchill over the troops in Burma back to Papua New Guinea, back to Kokoda. Arthur Caldwell got it right when he opposed the Vietnam war. Simon Crean got it right when he said, we shouldn’t be sending troops to Iraq and went to the wharf and waved them away while saying they shouldn’t be going. So, Labor has had a knockout set of rights against the Coalition. But this one is where we break the winning streak. Chinese state media responds to Aukus announcement As reported overnight, China’s foreign ministry has renewed its longstanding criticisms of the Aukus arrangement, including its impact on nuclear non-proliferation and “cold war zero-sum mentality”. Those lines have been backed up, with flourishes, in Chinese state media coverage. This morning, the Global Times published an editorial under the headline “Nuclear submarines will turn Australia into a ‘haunted house’”. It said Australia was “at best a cat’s paw which helps the US to get chestnuts from the fire, and it can be regarded as one of the most representative chump in the history of international relations”. The editorial said: In order to obtain the US’ nuclear-powered submarines, Australia may have to spend nearly $250 billion. Does Australia have too many mines and is too wealthy? … Australia’s inexplicable sense of insecurity when facing China is basically the result of being spiritually controlled for many years by the US. Australia thinks that it is the “deputy sheriff” of the Asia-Pacific region under Washington, but not to mention that it has no salary, even its police uniforms and firearms have to be bought from the US at a high price. The Aukus agreement is actually a big trick of the US on Australia. The China Daily’s editorial was titled “Aukus nuclear submarine ‘cooperation’ reckless acceleration on a dangerous road”. That editorial said the deal “only serves to make Australia the vanguard in the proxy war that the US seems intent on waging against China on the pretext of the Taiwan question, as several US officials have already openly taunted”. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, yesterday took aim at China’s immediate response to the Aukus announcement, telling Guardian Australia that criticism was “not grounded in fact”. Wong told ABC Radio National today that Australia did not believe China’s assertions about the non‑proliferation treaty reflect the text of the treaty. The federal opposition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said today: China’s response to it overnight is becoming more typical. There’s a lot of disinformation out there and we have made a modest investment into our military capability relative to theirs. They are undergoing the biggest peacetime military expansion since the second world war, which includes nuclear weapons. So to lecture us, I think is rather ironic. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has accused Labor of running a “scare campaign” after its claim the government considered privatising Sydney Water. On Tuesday leaked confidential documents emerged showing the Coalition sought advice on a possible sale of the water agency while Perrottet was treasurer. “The shareholders have shown a preference for maintaining or increasing returns to government and asset recycling,” a board level briefing note generated by the utility revealed. During a leaders’ debate airing on the Nine Network today, the opposition leader, Chris Minns, has repeatedly referred to the document as evidence the government has considered selling the agency. But Perrottet said the government had “ruled out” privatising the agency, and insisted the government had “never conducted a scoping study” on a possible sale. He said: We’ve never directed the public service in relation to Sydney Water. We’ve completely ruled it out. Former prime minister Paul Keating has called the Aukus deal Labor’s “worst international decision”: NSW energy minister’s job a tough one no matter which party wins government It’s unusual these days to get many record days of demand for electricity from the grid in part because of the spread of rooftop solar panels. Last week, NSW hit a record load for March on a day when a brief heatwave passed through, with the market operator surprised by how much demand spiked. Later this week, we might well see a repeat with an extended hot spell settling in, particularly for western Sydney with as many as six days forecast to top 33 degrees in a row. (Tomorrow may be the hottest, with 37 degrees forecast for Penrith.) Unlike last week, there will also be some warmth in Queensland, with Brisbane headed for a top of 35 on Friday. Anyway, it’s a good thing AGL Energy won’t start turning off the remaining three units at its Liddell power station until 20 April. By about 29 April, 1260 megawatts of capacity will have been lost to the grid for good. With the election just over a week away, the Coalition government will be hoping there won’t be the need to ask companies (such as the Tomago aluminium smelter) to power down to avoid “unserved” energy, or blackouts. It’s a good opportunity, though, to look forward to what challenges the next energy minister faces in NSW in coming years, whether that person is the high-profile incumbent, Liberal Matt Kean, or Jihad Dib, Labor’s energy spokesperson. (Or someone else). We look at the issues here (and why the state may be “stuffed” without some big renewable energy plants and storages projects coming on line in a timely manner): Malaysia issued a statement overnight in which it said it had not shifted its position on Aukus. Indonesia and Malaysia were vocal after Aukus was first announced in 2021 in raising nuclear non-proliferation concerns and also warning against moves that could trigger an arms race. Indonesia’s response yesterday was relatively warm. But Malaysia has signalled it remains concerned. Malaysia’s ministry of foreign affairs began by saying it appreciated the consultation in advance of the announcement yesterday. It noted Australia, the US and the UK’s readiness “in engaging with Malaysia at various levels and in sharing the latest updates and future outlook of Aukus prior to the announcement”. The statement went on to say Malaysia “acknowledges the needs of countries in terms of enhancing defence capabilities taking into account respective requirements and concerns”. It added: Nevertheless, Malaysia’s position on Aukus remains. Malaysia reiterates as a matter of principle the importance of all parties within and beyond this security partnership to fully respect and comply with … Malaysia’s national regime in relation to operation of nuclear-powered submarines in our waters, including those under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ) Treaty, and the Asean Declaration on the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN). Malaysia further underscores the importance of promoting transparency and confidence-building among all countries, and refraining from any provocation that could potentially trigger an arms race or affect peace and security in the region. Readers will notice the call to avoid provocations that could trigger an arms race was directed at “all countries” rather than any in particular. Euan Graham, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Australian newspaper there was “nothing in UNCLOS or the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone that outlaws the passage of nuclear-powered subs”. The Queensland government has announced it will deliver a rebate on household power bills in the next financial year The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the “cost-of-living relief” provided to Queenslanders would be higher than the $175 rebate provided last year. Palaszczuk said the government would determine the amount of the final rebate based on power prices and the support provided by the federal government in the May budget. She said: Once these rebates are locked in and we see the final energy prices in May, our government will go further. Our government is only able to provide cost-of-living support to households and to deliver on the Queensland energy and jobs plan because Queenslanders own our power assets. Power price rise is ‘problematic’, Victoria Energy Policy Centre chief says As seen in the earlier post, Victoria’s standard offer power prices are likely to leap by almost a third from July if a draft recommendation from the Essential Services Commission gets up. Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, has called on the commission to “think again” about its “problematic” recommended price increase in the Victorian Default Offer. Mountain says: They average contract prices over a 12-month period and so their calculation reflects the surge in contract prices from around June to October last year. But there is little evidence to suggest that these contract prices represent the costs that retailers will incur over the coming 12 month period. The result is that the increases – if maintained in the final decision – would “needlessly deliver large windfall profits particularly for Victoria’s large retailers, at customers’ expense”. “This is contrary to the government’s stated objective in introducing the VDO.” That press conference after the signing of the cooperation agreement between the Albanese government and the Malinauskas government to support the construction of the Aukus submarines has wrapped up. To summarise, the agreement “establishes a genuine partnership between the Commonwealth and South Australia” as part of which the federal and state government will work together to realise the following: An exchange of land as soon as possible to facilitate development of the new submarine construction yard and a skills and training academy campus in Osborne, South Australia. The construction, establishment and operation of a skills and training academy campus in South Australia, to be co-designed by the commonwealth and the state, and developed in consultation with industry and unions. An increase in commonwealth supported places to South Australia universities over the next four years, focused on STEM disciplines in professional engineering (mechanical, electrical, chemical), computer science, mathematics, chemistry, physics, psychology and management. The commonwealth will allocate an additional 800 places to South Australia universities over the next four years, with the first 200 places starting next year. Investment in research capability and infrastructure in priority disciplines in South Australia to generate a workforce close to the submarine construction yard at Osborne. Progress consideration of options for defence-related science and technology facilities in Adelaide. A potential land exchange as well as appropriate easement and access arrangements in relation to Department of Defence owned and leased land at Cultana. More jobs under Aukus than from cancelled French contract, Conroy says The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, gets his two cents in before the press conference wraps up. He’s providing context around the number of jobs created by Aukus compared to the cancelled French Attack class: This project will create around 20,000 jobs and importantly, in the dockyard, right here, this project will deliver around twice as many jobs as the Attack class project would have delivered. So it’s really important to have that context: 20,000 jobs nationwide, 8,000 jobs on building and sustaining the platform, 5,500 jobs building the submarine itself, twice as many as would have been delivered under the cancelled French Attack class. Marles speaks about budget pressures On the eyewatering $368bn cost of Aukus, Marles is asked how much money in the defence budget will have to find to pay for these submarines: We’ve been upfront that defence budget will need to grow over the medium to long term. We’ve made a really important statement that over the forward estimates, over the next four years, defence will cover the costs associated with this program. That’s a really big statement, I think, to government and to the nation in general that defence is going to play its part in terms of facilitating the cost to this and we’ll have more to say about that in the lead-up to the budget in May and with the announcement of the defence strategic review in April. There are measures that we can take, but we’ve been completely clear about the fact that a growing defence budget is one of the pressures on the federal budget and that is driving the big defences that we’re making. In our first budget, we returned 99% of the revenue upgrades to the budget. No one does that but we’ve done it because we understand how important it is to have sensible fiscal management given the pressures on the budget and also given that we inherited $1tn of debt from the former Coalition government. ‘No government has done what this government is doing’ The foreign minister, Penny Wong, takes the mic to speak about what the Albanese government is delivering for her home state of South Australia, which Wong says no other government have been able to deliver to date. I’ve been coming down here for many years … And each time we’ve been down here with workers, with industry, with the community demanding local jobs, demanding certainty. No government has done what this government is doing. No government has not only set out an optimal pathway for decades, but no government has come down here and recognised that we need the partnership between federal, state, academic sector, the tertiary sector, the training sector, to deliver the workforce. And I said yesterday in the press conference with the premier and the deputy premier, this investment will do for South Australia what the car industry did, but much more. It will change the nature of our economy. We know that key to that is workforce and skills. That’s something no government has had a plan for. We have a plan and we are committed to delivering it. Marles: Submarine construction ‘before the end of this decade’ Taking questions, Marles says the construction of the shipyard is the starting point and emphasises the importance of stewardship when it comes to nuclear-powered submarines: The starting point here is the construction of the yard and that really happens immediately, which is why this land exchange is so important, to be able to facilitate access to the land immediately. I mean one of the things that’s become very apparent for me as we’ve been walking along this journey is just how significant is the requirement for Australia to be a nuclear steward in terms of managing our nuclear enterprise in the safest possible way. That requires building buildings and security around here of a different order of magnitude than we would have seen before. We are very focused on doing that, getting access to the land straight away and as we’ve said, the construction of the submarines themselves will happen before the end of this decade. Building submarine construction yard will generate thousands of jobs, O’Connor says O’Connor says government and industry will be working very closely with universities: We have to work very closely with universities in South Australia and beyond and minister Jason Clare, of course, is very much focused on the need to supply skills from universities. This is something that, of course, will be, as I say, we’ll be working across government, working with the defence minister, the defence industry minister, and ensuring that we can get this right. It really does start today. A roundtable of South Australian industry representatives and other representatives that we are discussing the matters with today. The first, of course, investment decision will be to commence the construction of the submarine construction yard, which, of course, amounts to thousands of construction jobs. $8bn upgrade for HMAS Stirling naval base in WA O’Connor flags there will be an $8bn upgrade flagged for HMAS Stirling naval base in WA: Of course there’s no doubt that this decision will provide for South Australia a remarkable investment in the economy a remarkable opportunity for workers to get into very high-skills, secure, long-term employment. And that’s the case too for those in we’re Australia with the upgrade of HMAS Stirling, where we’re going to see a very significant investment in that state as well. But I want to make it also very clear, very much like the automotive industry, there will be the efforts of other companies in other states that will be in a supply chain, providing opportunities for those businesses too. Because this is a national effort of significant scale, as the deputy prime minister has made clear, probably the most significant decision in the defence realm for many a decade. Aukus means ‘many, many jobs’, says Brendan O’Connor The minister for skills and training, Brendan O’Connor, steps up to speak after Marles: This is an important decision, first and foremost a national security decision. But it’s also a decision that means many, many jobs for South Australians, for Western Australians and indeed for workers around the country. This is about ensuring that we have a capacity to provide a greater likelihood of stability and peace in our region but to do so we need to invest in skills in order to provide the capability and the capacity for the defence industry to produce these remarkable defence assets. And for that reason, there has to be not only a whole-of-government approach to this but, indeed, working with other governments and work being industry, employers and unions, to make sure we get this right. ‘This is happening right now’ Here is what Marles has to say about those announcements Dan mentioned which will enable South Australia to develop the capacity to build those submarines: There are three important practical initial steps in terms of that cooperation: The first is a commitment to an increase of 800 university places here in South Australia over the coming four years in areas which are critical to the building of nuclear-powered submarines, particularly in areas of engineering and mathematics. The second is the establishment of a training academy right here at Osborne, which will provide for apprentices and the trade-level training which is so particular to the building of nuclear-powered submarines and my colleague, Minister O’Connor, is going to speak more to that in a moment. The third is a land exchange which is going to provide South Australia with really important land at Keswick in urban Adelaide, land at Cultana which is important but from the defence point of view is going to provide in exchange the land right here at Osborne necessary to put in place the construction yard which will ultimately build these submarines. I want to emphasise that our intent is to build this capacity as soon as possible which will see the construction of the yard happen immediately and this land exchange today forms the beginning of that. This is happening right now. Marles talks up cooperation agreement Richard Marles: You’ve just witnessed the premier and I sign a cooperation agreement between the commonwealth of Australia and the state of South Australia. The most important aspect of that is a headline commitment between our two governments to work cooperatively together to deliver this project and that’s really important because that’s going to need to happen not just during the life of our governments but a cross commonwealth and South Australian governments over the coming decades. It is a profoundly important statement of intent because unless that is in place, and unless that cooperation is enduring, we will not be able to deliver this capability for our nation. The Labor premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, has joined senior Australian ministers at the Osborne naval shipyard in Adelaide. After the signing of a cooperation agreement between the state and the federal governments, Malinauskas said there was no longer a question about where the work was going to come from in South Australia. It was, instead, a question of how build up the required workforce: The fact that the commonwealth sees in South Australia the ability to build the most complex machines that have ever been produced in the history of humanity says a lot about where South Australia is going. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said the agreement included a headline commitment to work cooperatively together to deliver this project. They were also planning an increase of 800 university places in South Australia over four years, the establishment of a training academy “right here at Osborne”, and a land exchange to allow for a larger construction yard. Marles: Yesterday’s announcement commits Australia to developing the capacity as quickly as possible to build nuclear-powered submarines here in South Australia right here at Osborne. This is demanded of us by our international partners. It is a massive endeavour. ‘This is going to be building the most complex machinery known to humanity’ Acting prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles is speaking at the Osborne shipyards in Adelaide about – you guessed it – Aukus: Marles says building submarines in Australia “right here at Osborne, this is demanded of us by our international partners”: This is a massive endeavour. It is of the same order of magnitude of the Snowy River scheme in the 60s. It’s going to transform our national economy but it is going to transform the South Australian economy. Thousands of jobs, a lifting-up of the technological capability of the broader economy. What this will see across the three countries of the United States, the UK and Australia is the fourth production line to build nuclear-powered submarines, adding to Huntington’s in the United States and BAE in the United Kingdom. This is going to be building the most complex machinery known to humanity, which means this site will become one of the centres of highest technology industry in the world. And it is absolutely a vote of confidence in Australian industry but a vote of confidence in South Australian history. As La Niña ends, El Niño watch begins … Straight off the back of three consecutive La Niña periods, the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting an El Niño weather event could be in store during Australia’s winter and spring. Sarah Scully, a senior meteorologist at the bureau, is speaking to ABC News about when the big wet of the past three years is predicated to end: La Niña predominantly affects eastern and northern Australia. It officially ended yesterday and it is driven by sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. So as we became very familiar with over the last three years, we had above-average sea surface temperatures off north-eastern and northern parts of the country and that provided a whole lot more moisture available for increased rainfall, increased cloud cover that resulted in lower temperatures as well. As you mentioned, La Niña has ended and we’ve moved into the El Niño watch with a 50% chance of going into an El Niño later this year. Loathed amongst children, loved amongst statisticians, the annual Naplan assessment is kicking off today for 1.3m students. This is the first year the test is being held in March instead of May following reforms by the federal government to provide earlier access to results. It’s also taking place fully online, excluding the year 3 writing test which will be on paper. Ceo of the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority David de Carvalho said the decision to push the test forward required an “enormous effort” amongst teachers and schools. Ministers agreed to moving Naplan into Term 1 so the results would be available earlier in the year to inform teaching and learning programs. It will give teachers earlier insights to support their professional judgment about how their students are progressing against the new proficiency standards and consider what support they might need in the coming year.” The national assessment is the only major scale of progress in critical literacy and numeracy skills among students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 - testing reading, writing, numeracy, grammar, punctuation and spelling. De Carvalho: It doesn’t measure overall school quality. It’s not meant to tell us everything about a student or their achievement. Naplan tests literacy and numeracy skills that are being developed in the classroom everyday with questions based mostly on what students have been taught from previous years of schooling. The results will also be streamlined into four levels of achievement, replacing the previous 10-band structure. Parents will be able to track their children under the categories “exceeding”, “strong”, “developing” and “needs additional support”. Assessors will be crossing their fingers this year is more successful than the last Naplan, when secondary student participation experienced the steepest declines on record. Remote, educationally disadvantaged and low-performing children were least likely to complete the tests. Pocock highlights ‘enormous’ $368bn Aukus price tag Senator David Pocock was also asked about the $368bn price tag of the 30-year Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition plan, and whether this makes a mockery of government claims about a tight budget. Pocock: We’ve heard so much about how tight the budget is, and it is. We have some huge challenges we’re facing. And we’ve heard that we can’t spend money on things that are really important to our communities and to our country. And this [Aukus] is a massive spending commitment for decades to come. Clearly, that money has to come from somewhere. So I’m certainly pushing and would welcome a conversation about where that comes from. We’ve got stage three-tax cuts, $250bn, slated to come in to effect and we’ve got the major parties who won’t touch things like revisiting negative gearing, capital gains tax discounts on investment properties. All of these things that I think a lot of Australians are starting to question and particularly when it comes to this enormous commitment of spending for decades to come. That money’s going to have to come from somewhere. If we are going to be responsible with the budget, then there’s some very tough conversations ahead for the for the major parties. On Tuesday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said despite the need to pay for Aukus there was no change to Labor’s policy on stage-three tax cuts. As we saw in an earlier post, default power prices are likely to lift by more than 20% from 1 July for customers in New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland, according to a draft decision by the Australian Energy Regulator. Victoria sets its own default market offer and that is going to increase even more, according to draft decision for consultation. The state’s Essential Services Commission is proposing average annual bill for domestic customers will rise 31.1%, with small business customers facing increases of 33.2%. The commission says: The draft decision proposes an increase of around $426 for residential customers, with typical bills increasing from $1,403 to around $1,829 per year. For small business customers, typical bills would increase by around $1,738, from $5,620 to around $7,358 per year. As with the AER, the commission blames “significant increases in wholesale electricity costs” for the higher prices. The offer affects about 400,000 households and 55,000 small businesses that are on standing offers. That’s about 15% of households and 19% of small firms. Victoria has tended to have lower wholesale prices than other states so it’s curious the state’s default prices have risen more – at least according to the draft decision. A final decision on the increase will be made on 24 May. The incoming national secretary of the construction union, Zach Smith, and senator David Pocock have held a press conference in Canberra to discuss building company insolvencies at which both called on Labor to up their ambition on the housing Australia future fund bill. The pair were responding to the collapse of PBS Building, with creditors owed an estimated $250m. They called for the government to do more to ensure “security of payments”, ie ensuring workers and other creditors are not out of pocket. Pocock said more “political will” was needed to enact solutions such as the proposed developers register in the ACT. Smith cited solutions including statutory trusts (requiring companies to pay progressively into a pot of money reserved for their creditors), and greater action from regulators such as the Fair Work Ombudsman and Tax Office. Asked if these demands were forming part of negotiations with the government, Pocock said Labor had committed to reforms recommended by the Murray review so he “shouldn’t have to use” his vote on bills like the future fund as a “negotiating tactic”. On that bill, Pocock said he wanted “more ambition” because the plan (to invest $10bn in a future fund that will pay out up to $500m a year) “is not going to touch the sides when it comes to dealing with the scale of the housing crisis that we’ve seen in the ACT”. Pocock said there were 3,100 people on the social housing waiting list but it looked as though the government bill “at best will provide 540 additional homes in the ACT”: That’s not enough. Smith echoed these comments and said the CFMEU was not just concerned about lack of new builds but lack of maintenance of existing housing stock. Nurses and midwives are launching legal action against the NSW government over staffing ratios they say are leaving patients without adequate care, AAP reports. The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association revealed plans today to file a case in the supreme court which accuses the government of repeatedly breaching award conditions. It says widespread non-compliance with staffing levels has resulted in patients not receiving more than 100,000 hours of nursing care at multiple public hospitals. Nurses and midwives have held repeated industrial action over the past year calling for mandated “safe” staffing ratios, along with better pay and conditions. NSW has fallen behind other states in implementing legally mandated ratios, with Victoria, Queensland and the ACT already introducing them, while South Australia and Western Australia are both progressing measures, according to the association. The union says it will provide evidence of inadequate staffing at major public hospitals including Royal Prince Alfred, Gosford, Wollongong, Westmead, Liverpool and Nepean. General secretary Shaye Candish says the government’s nursing hours per patient day staffing system is not delivering safe care to patients at their most vulnerable. Renewables push Asked about whether it could be time to reopen the discussion about nuclear power in Australia, Chris Bowen says the opposition’s plan is a “fantasy” because nuclear is the most expensive form of energy available and Australia would be starting from scratch without the infrastructure and resources necessary: Well, it would be a particularly bizarre discussion. It would be particularly bizarre conversation to say that the answer to high power prices is to introduce the most expensive form of energy available – nuclear. That’s the Liberal plan. Mr O’Brien, my shadow minister, takes himself off doing little videos in in Japan, “Nuclear: what we can learn from Hiroshima” and “Nuclear: what we can learn from Fukushima”. Particularly bizarre little intervention but bizarre in policy substance. The cheapest energy is renewable energy. (You can read about that from Josh Butler:) We’re working to get our energy grid to 82% renewables by 2030. We will. Right around the world, experts recognise that nuclear is very expensive. Particularly expensive in Australia, because we don’t have a nuclear industry to start with. We’d be starting from scratch without the infrastructure and the resources necessary to underpin a nuclear industry. Nuclear power plants are very expensive. They run over budget. They run over time. Mr Dutton can go off on the fantasy frolic if he wants. We’ll remain focused on the job of introducing more of the cheapest form of energy, the cheapest form of energy, which is renewables. ‘I’m not about to give up for working for lower power prices’ Chris Bowen is asked about the election promise to lower power bills by $275 by 2025, which the opposition keeps bringing up (without mentioning the fact that the Coalition delayed news that electricity prices were set to rise until after federal election). But the energy minister is indicating he’s not giving up on lowering power prices. Reporter: Given the ongoing price rises, will you be able to achieve the $270 price cut? Bowen: Of course, we indicated that that would be there. I’m not about to give up for working for lower power prices. Chris Bowen throws back to Coalition on energy price rises The energy minister is borrowing a turn of phrase out of Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech when asked about the Coalition’s suggestion that capping coal and gas prices will, in the longer run, increase prices. Chris Bowen: I invite the Coalition to have a look in the mirror. I mean, he had the independent energy regulator this morning pointing out that without the intervention, the price rises would have been closer to 50%. An intervention that Mr Dutton opposed, like he opposes everything. You can’t complain about higher energy prices and then vote for higher energy prices. We’ve carefully calibrated the interventions and worked through them carefully. Mr Dutton and his bunch of irrelevancies put themselves out of the process and opposed the package and did not enter into discussions with the government. Bill relief will come in the budget, Bowen says Reporter: Acoss is calling for emergency payments for debt relief, for people who can’t afford to pay the increased costs. Can you provide any direct relief to consumers who need it? Chris Bowen: Direct relief is exactly what will be in the budget in relation to the energy price relief that the treasurer is working through with his state and territory colleagues. We outlined, if you like, the guidelines, the contours for that last year but obviously there’s a lot of detailed negotiation to go into that. And that is exactly what we’re working on, and which he will deliver in the budget. We had a two-step process, intervening to cap coal and gas prices. Not universally popular with coal and gas companies but had to be done. Not supported by the opposition, but had to be done. And, of course, the bill relief that will be in the budget. Angus Taylor hid last year’s increases, minister says Chris Bowen makes the point my colleague Amy Remeikis highlighted on the blog this morning – Angus Taylor, the former energy minister knew power prices would be increasing (as reported here and here). This is the default market offer. It happens every year. The equivalent was hidden by Angus Taylor last year. Angus Taylor, in the most cynical move I’ve seen in a long time in politics, changed the law to hide the default market market increases from a short time before the last election to just after the last election. He actually issued a law change to keep the increases last year, which were similar to these, hidden and secret until after the election. We’ll deal with them. We dealt with them in the intervention. We’ll be honest with the Australian people about the pressures in the system, pressures on energy prices on Australia and around the world, and we will also deal with them by the sorts of interventions that we have announced and we’ll anticipate continue to work on. Chris Bowen says “there is more relief yet to flow”. The Treasurer, Dr Chalmers, is negotiating with all of his state and territory colleagues, the rebates that will be in the federal budget. Those rebates will provide further relief over and above the package of interventions that we announced last year. Liberal party voted against energy market intervention, Bowen says Chris Bowen goes on to speak a bit more about the energy market intervention the government recalled parliament before Christmas to pass: This was an intervention that was controversial. Mr Dutton and the Liberal party voted against it. If they had their way, the Liberal party, if they had their way, these increases would have been 50%, not 20%. They walked into the parliament and voted against these interventions. They walked into the parliament and voted for even higher price rises. That’s what the Liberal party wanted. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has stepped up to speak in Sydney after the energy regulator predicting power price increases in NSW, south-east Queensland and South Australia: Bowen: Firstly, these are big increases. That should be acknowledged and they will hurt for many families. Secondly, these increases would have been much, much higher without the intervention of the Albanese government last year working with the governments particularly of New South Wales and Queensland. These interventions last year were absolutely vital as the regulator, herself, has made clear this morning. In the absence of intervention, these sorts of increases would have had potentially a five in front of it, not a two. These increases of 50% that the government was looking at last year would have crippled many businesses and been a crushing blow to Australian families. Hence we took the intervention we did last year. Air pollution in NSW causes 603 premature deaths and costs $4.8bn a year, study finds Air pollution in New South Wales is estimated to cause 603 premature deaths and increase health costs by $4.8bn each year, according to a long-term government study. Published online the day before the Perrottet government went into caretaker mode before this month’s state election, the Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city’s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization. Illicit drug trade immune from cost-of-living pain Illicit drug consumption has dropped in Australia but cost-of-living pressures have had no impact on demand, with the country’s most popular drug also the most expensive, AAP reports. More than 14 tonnes of methylamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and MDMA were detected in wastewater systems between August 2021 and 2022, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission’s latest wastewater snapshot. That’s a reduction of about 10% compared with last year but the commission attributes the fall to drug busts rather than financial pressures. The commission’s principal drug adviser Shane Neilson said: Those drugs had an estimated street value of $10bn, which is a real concern at a time when household budgets across the country were stretched. More than 83% of that haul was methylamphetamine, which can be turned into highly addictive drugs ice and speed. Opioids are a growing concern, with heroin the second most used illicit drug nationally, and consumption of oxycodone and fentanyl also on the rise. MDMA usage fell 41% and cocaine has dropped by almost one-third. According to the report: The median national street price of a cocaine “deal” is less than the price for a crystal methylamphetamine “deal”, so price does not appear to be a factor in the decreased consumption of cocaine. It’s estimated 600kg of cocaine were seized in 2022, which was about double the amount thought to have been ingested. SA premier pushes back on nuclear waste In the unveiling of the Aukus deal, it was revealed that Australia will be responsible for any nuclear waste generated by the submarines. South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas believes just because his state is set to benefit the most economically with from the lion’s share of the jobs, doesn’t mean the waste dump should be in South Australia: Ultimately it should be somewhere safe. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s in South Australia. I think the work that we’re doing in South Australia isn’t a labour demand creation exercise for our state. It’s about which state is best equipped to meet the security needs of our nation and this is the heart of naval shipbuilding in Australia – fact. Now, where the nuclear waste goes, a similar case should be applied and that is – not what is in the best interests of a parochial argument – rather, what is in the best interest of the nation’s security and that should inform the federal government’s judgment. Malinauskas talks up South Australian skills SA premier Peter Malinauskas is heading off to the UK later today where he will visit the skills academy in Barrow where they build nuclear-powered subs. Before leaving, he’s told ABC Radio about the challenges around the technical complexity of building nuclear powered submarines: The single biggest challenge for SA and indeed the nation in undoubtedly workforce. We’ve got a lot of work to do to build up the skills base that is required to build what will be the most complex machines ever built in our country … What we’ve always needed is a continuity of work, a continuous demand for naval shipbuilding expertise that gives the industry but also workers the confidence to plan their lives around. We’ve now got that in South Australia … It’s important to understand the level of complexity building a nuclear submarine over and above a conventionally powered submarine. Everything about it is more technical, and more complex and more demanding on our skills base … Production will take a long time on that first nuclear submarine. But once that first one is in the water, we can expect them to be produced every three years from there on in. Malinauskas says the first of the Aukus submarines to be produced in Adelaide, which will come into active service with the navy in 2042, will be produced throughout the 2030s. ‘Stabilisation still means acting in our national interest,’ Wong says China (and Russia) have both reacted quite strongly to the Aukus agreement – that was expected. All three countries were prepared for some harsh language and disgruntlement from the two powers in response to the agreement that will see Australia’s strategic defences in this region boosted through nuclear-powered submarines (as well as increased US and UK presence in Australia). China was offered a briefing on the plan, which it was understood not to have taken up (but, as you read on, that might not be correct). Australia’s diplomats (and ministers) have done a lot of work to brief countries in the region, with Richard Marles mentioning yesterday they had made more than 60 phone calls to do what they could to allay any concerns about the announcement. Penny Wong, speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast, said stabilising the relationship with China didn’t mean just kowtowing to China: I always made clear that stabilisation still means acting in our national interest. I always said we wanted to cooperate with China where we can, disagree where we must and we will engage in our national interests. And we will continue to do that. Wong said she believed China would be briefed on the Aukus plan: We’re always happy to be very transparent about our plans. We believe that one of the ways we can deal in the region openly clearly and be clear to demonstrate our motivation, which is stability and peace, is to be very transparent about our plans. Wong said she had offered her counterpart a briefing when she met him in Delhi and China would be offered “further briefings” from the department. What does “further” briefings mean? Wong: We are having a general diplomatic corps briefing and I understand China will be attending. Along with many other countries and that is a good thing and in that briefing, this issue around submarines and Australia’s military spend will be central. Wong said briefings of that nature were normal in the course of diplomacy. Acoss urges intervention to lower power bills The Australian Council of Social Service is calling on the government to intervene and make the energy regulator lower its retail margins. The Australian Energy Regulator this morning released a draft decision that household energy prices in some states are likely to surge by 19.5% to 23.7%. Acoss is calling on the federal government to follow Victoria’s lead and update its guidelines to the regulator urging it to lower retail margins and set the direct market offer at a better price for consumers. Its chief executive Cassandra Goldie said: In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, today’s announcement of another increase to electricity prices by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) is a blow to people across Australia, most of all those on low-incomes, who experienced average 20% rises last year. While the projected increase of between 20 and 22% to the Default Market Offer by the Australian Energy Regulator could have been an even higher increase if not for the Albanese Government energy price cap at the end of 2022, it is still far too high for people on low incomes already struggling with cost-of-living crisis. People on the lowest incomes do not have anything left in their budgets to cut back on and are at breaking point. We are worried about what consequences this leaves for people, including further debt, disconnection, or homelessness. These are unacceptable choices to be made in such a wealthy country. As well as calling on the government to update the regulator’s guidelines, Acoss is repeating calls to lift jobseeker to at least $76 a day and to increase commonwealth rent assistance by 50% to reduce rental stress. Acoss also wants to see the government provide energy debt relief of up to $2,000 a customer in energy hardship, as well as federal government coinvest with state and territory governments in energy efficiency, electrification and solar retrofits for low-income housing and institute mandatory energy performance rental standards. How will we pay for Aukus? Natasha has covered off some of shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie’s interview on RN Breakfast there. There were lots of interesting bits in there, including that he agrees that there needs to be some other cuts to defence to pay for it. The total estimated cost is $368bn – but that is obviously not due immediately. It’s staggered over the next 30 years. Over the next four years (the forwards) the government needs to find $9bn to pay for the first parts of the bill. Jim Chalmers says that is cost neutral as $6bn is coming from scrapping the French deal and $3bn is coming from other cuts within defence. Peter Dutton yesterday was against cutting from elsewhere in defence. He said on Tuesday: It’s not credible for the government to say that there’s no net impact even over the forward estimates. We can’t allow Labor to cannibalise the defence force to pay for Aukus – it’s not an either or option. Hastie though, says there is room for cuts in defence. He told ABC News Breakfast: I think there’s waste in every government department and what we want clarity on is what cuts are going to be made. There’s a lot of uncertainty in defence industry. There’s existing programs which have a lot of Australian content. We’ll know next month with the defence strategic review. But we’re calling on the government to be transparent about where the cuts will be, what programs will be affected, what services will be affected. At the moment there is no clarity. As you would expect, the opposition has seized on the energy market default market offer, with shadow energy minister Ted O’Brien calling it a “broken promise reconfirmed”. He is referring to Labor’s promise to lower power bills by $275 by 2025. Labor won’t repeat the commitment now, that is true. It made it during the election, based on modelling showing what adding more renewables to the grid would do (and the rewiring the nation plan). But it is also a bit rich for the opposition to be lumping all of this at Labor’s feet, given that Angus Taylor, the former energy minister (minister for lowering power prices, as Scott Morrison used to call him) KNEW power prices would be increasing (as reported here and here). But O’Brien is leading the opposition charge against the government on this: Winter is on the way and I have grave fears that senior citizens and families doing it tough won’t turn on the heater for fear of their energy bill. The human impact of Labor’s failure to manage Australia’s energy market should not be underestimated. In terms of “managing the Australia’s energy market”, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supply chain issues have had a pretty big impact – but never let facts get in the way of a good political line. As we mentioned a little earlier, we are all waiting on national cabinet to deliver the targeted relief for the east coast states – and hopefully that will take away at least some of the sting. The opposition voted against that plan when it went to the parliament in December. ‘New strategic disorder’ On the breaking news that a Russian fighter jet has hit a US drone, Richard Marles told ABC News Breakfast it was yet another example of Russia “not playing by the rules”. Marles said he had no information that wasn’t already in the public domain but said it was a “very worrying development”. Andrew Hastie says it came as another example of the “new strategic disorder”: I think it’s priced in with Russia. They’re an authoritarian regime. They’ve started an illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Thousands have died in the past year … We hear the news this Russian fighter has flown into a US drone. It sort of seems normal, sadly. But this is the new strategic disorder that we are facing, not just in eastern Europe, but also in our region and that’s why we support the government in taking action to acquire these submarines for the Australian navy going forward. ‘Funding Aukus will require sacrifices’ The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has said the Coalition would support NDIS cuts to pay for Aukus submarines. Andrew Hastie is asked why shouldn’t there be other savings found in the defence budget to pay for the submarines. As the assistant defence minister, I saw a lot of waste. And this is there is always there are always savings to be made. So we’re not arguing that there should be no cuts. We just want to make sure that these are done in a considered way if they are done and we also want certainly. Defence industry in Australia wants certainty. And they’re waiting for the defence strategic review to be handed down because they want to know which programs will be cut. They want to know which businesses will be affected. And the Australian public needs to know as well. Asked about Dutton’s comments about the NDIS, and where he would want to find savings, Hastie says: Peter mentioned NDIS as an example – he was referring to having a conversation with the government about finding efficiencies across government, because that’s the reality that we face. We can’t allow costs to balloon, we can’t live beyond our means. Now, the NDIS is a really important program for vulnerable Australians and the Coalition has supported it from its inception. I want to make that very clear. But funding Aukus will require sacrifices and I think the government needs to be upfront about how they’re going to fund it. ‘We are supportive,’ Coalition says Andrew Hastie has reiterated the opposition’s support for the deal but says the the opposition will question the timing and budget: We are supportive. I want to make that very clear that the Coalition supports the Albanese government’s move to acquire their submarines. I think this is an excellent and prudent decision. Now we do have questions as an opposition. We have questions about the timing, and our sequencing of the acquisition of these submarines. And of course, the cost to our bottom line because this is a massive spend – $368bn over the life of the project. It is going to require sacrifice and that’s an important point. So we’ll be holding them to account as you would expect us to in the best traditions of the Westminster system. Hastie labels Chinese accusations ‘ironic’ The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, is speaking to ABC Radio about the Aukus deal. He’s critical of the accusations from China: China is undergoing the biggest peacetime military expansion since the second world war. So it’s it’s a bit ironic for them to give us a lecture about a modest increase in our military power relative to this … Certainly we don’t want to create any issues with with China. We just want to make sure that we will be able to defend ourselves in the future. ‘You’re talking about 20,000 direct jobs being created’ Richard Marles is asked about that enormous price tag which comes with protecting the national interest and the global rules based order. He’s defending the fact that any program that is designed to last several decades was always going to have a big price tag and that the investment will also deliver an economic dividend for Australia: We’ve been very upfront about the fact that we see the defence budget growing over the medium to long term and one of the pressures that we’re dealing with in respect of a budget where we’ve been making very significant decisions. We returned 99% of the revenue upgrades in the first budget that we handed down to the budget bottom line. They’re the kind of sensible budgetary decisions that we are making, given that we’ve inherited a budget with $1tn of debt. But we’ve been upfront about the fact that defence will be one of those pressures on the budget. But I’d make the point, you can extrapolate any particular government program through to the mid-2050s and you’ll get a large number. This is 0.15% of GDP we’re spending on submarines in a context where our defence spend is 2% of GDP, growing to 2.2%. This transformation of the capability and potency of the Australian defence force. The other point I make is the vast bulk that will be spent in the Australian economy itself. You’re talking about 20,000 direct jobs being created by virtue of the spend in respect of the submarines. So there will be an economic dividend associated with this and it will see an enormous increase in the technological capability of our broader economy. Power bill relief plan Hello from Canberra on this Wednesday morning. Just popping in with a little reminder that we are expecting the power bill relief plan to be signed off from national cabinet this month. That can’t come a moment too soon given what Peter Hannam has reported on electricity prices. You may remember the parliament was recalled in December last year to deal with power prices. The first step was market intervention – the government capped coal and gas prices. Prices were always going to go up (and obviously, they have) but they aren’t going up by as much as they would have without the intervention. Still, that’s cold comfort for people who are struggling to pay their bills. The next step of the plan was a $1.5bn direct relief plan, which will be jointly funded by the states and the commonwealth. The national cabinet is to sign off on that plan this month and each (east coast) state will explain how they plan on getting that money to their residents (without increasing inflation). Given the news today, that power price relief is needed more than ever and people will be anxiously waiting for details. We will bring it to you as soon as we can Acting prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles has spoken to ABC News Breakfast this morning after the $368bn announcement of the Aukus deal yesterday. In response to the reaction from China accusing Australia, the US and Britain of embarking on a “path of error and danger”, Marles defends making a decision that is in Australia’s national interest: We are seeking to acquire this capability to make our contribution to the collective security of the region and the maintenance of the global rules-based order. And one of the issues within our region we are witnessing the largest conventional military build-up that the world has seen since the end of the second world war. And it’s not Australia who is doing that, but that shapes the world in which we live. We would be condemned by history if we don’t put ourselves in a position where we can be able to guide Australia through that difficult set of strategic circumstances and maintain our national interests into the future. The decision we are making is going to hand to our kids and our grandkids a much more self-reliant country and a country which we will be able to keep safe. UK dismisses China’s claims The UK’s foreign secretary has dismissed China’s claims the Aukus submarine deal poses a nuclear proliferation threat. When the deal was unveiled yesterday, China’s foreign ministry said the pact would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN denounced that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has told the ABC there’s been no breach of the non proliferation treaty: We’re completely confident these are in complete compliance with non proliferation. Cleverly said there was no reason for China to believe that Australia’s decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines was directed towards it. Households in three states will face increases in the power bills of as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination is confirmed. The increases in the so-called default market offer were outlined in a media release from the regulator this morning. The electricity price safety net is in intended to mark the maximum increases for households and small business customers on standard retail plans in South Australia, New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Victoria is likely to release its own default over later today. Residential customers on standard retail plans could face price increases of 19.5% to 23.7% depending on their region, the regulator said. Small business customers could face price increases of 14.7% to 25.4% depending on their location. Clare Savage, the chair of the AER, told ABC’s Radio National this morning that while the increases were “significant” they could have been as much as 40% to 50% prior to the federal government’s intervention to cap domestic gas and black coal prices. Savage said: It’s still an increase so it’s not as bad as it could have been. The default market offer isn’t meant to be the cheapest rate out there – quite the opposite. It’s meant to be the maximum price that retailers can charge on default contracts. After consultation, the AER will issue its final default offer for the year. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has written to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency to formally request negotiations on oversight of the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plans, amid ongoing pushback from China. In a statement issued overnight, the IAEA’s director general, Rafael Grossi, noted the announcement by the leaders of Australia, the US and the UK “on Australia’s acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”. In addition to Wong’s letter, Grossi said he had received separate communications on this matter from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, as well as from the US and the UK, all reaffirming that “maintaining the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and Agency safeguards remains a core objective in relation to Aukus”. Grossi said: I also note Australia’s previous declaration to the Agency that it does not intend to pursue uranium enrichment or reprocessing in relation to Aukus and that it has no plans to undertake nuclear fuel fabrication as part of this effort. Grossi vowed to navigate the serious legal and complex technical matters “in an independent, impartial, and professional manner” and said the IAEA “must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project”. He explained that article 14 of the IAEA’s existing comprehensive safeguards agreement “allows Australia to use nuclear material which is required to be safeguarded under the CSA in a nuclear activity, such as nuclear propulsion for submarines, provided that Australia makes an arrangement with the Agency in this regard”. He added: Foreign Minister Wong has formally requested the Agency to commence negotiations on an arrangement required under Article 14 of Australia’s CSA. In accordance with the applicable norms (modified Code 3.1 of its Subsidiary Arrangements), Australia has also provided to the Agency preliminary design information related to this project. Grossi promised to keep the IAEA board of governors and member states informed of the work, and to submit a report on this matter to the next regular session of the board in Vienna in June. Good morning! Thanks to Martin for kicking things off, Natasha May on deck with you now. Institutional shareholders angry at Woodside Energy’s approach to climate change will take their fight to its board for the first time at next month’s AGM, Australian Associated Press reports. They are targeting three longstanding directors up for re-election – Queensland Resources Council chief executive and former federal resources minister Ian Macfarlane, Singaporean oil and gas executive Swee Chen Goh and American former oil boss Larry Archibald. The non-executive trio are up for another stint on the 10-member board (not including chairman Richard Goyder and managing director Meg O’Neill) and were expected to be rubber-stamped at the annual general meeting. But shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, alongside institutional investors – industry superannuation fund Vision Super and fund manager Betashares – said today they had lost faith in the directors. In statements relating to the re-election of directors sent to Woodside, they call for all three to be held to account for repeatedly failing to have a credible climate strategy and continuing to allocate the bulk of Woodside’s capital to developing new oil and gas projects. The activist shareholders are also concerned carbon offsets continue to dominate Woodside’s strategy to cut emissions at production sites, according to the statement filed with Woodside before the 23 April AGM. Shareholders across the Australian market are increasingly demanding climate accountability and sustainability competence at the board level, and many boards – including Woodside’s – have acknowledged climate change to be an issue that will affect their business. Woodside confirmed that members’ statements have been received from ACCR. A spokesperson said: These statements were not compliant with the requirements of the Corporations Act, and so will not be included in the upcoming notice of meeting. In response ACCR said it was deeply concerned at the apparent denial of shareholders’ ability to voice concerns about governance at the AGM. Also on 7.30 last night, Scott Morrison was grilled about the robodebt scandal, which he was inextricably linked to through his time as social services minister, treasurer and prime minister. The welfare compliance program, ruled to be illegal and the subject of a royal commission, was conceived during his timee as social services minister and later ended under his prime ministership when it was found to breach the law. Asked about the program, Morrison responded on 7.30: It is totally regrettable and it is a very sad thing that has occurred. He said “there was a lot learned”but defended the intent behind the scheme. The idea of ensuring that taxpayers’ money, which is paid, is done properly is the principle and I think that principle is right. But clearly how this was executed on an industrial scale failed that test. 7.30 host Sarah Ferguson repeatedly asked Morrison if the program was immoral. He declined to answer specifically, but said: I think the outcome, not the intent, but the outcome was very different from what was intended. Baby dies two days after crash that killed mother and brother A baby girl has died two days after she was pulled from the wreckage of a car crash in Sydney’s south-west that killed her mother and brother, Australian Associated Press reports. NSW police said the three-month-old, named in media reports as Ivy Prahastono, died in the Children’s hospital in Westmead on Wednesday morning. Her 34-year-old mother Katrina Prahastono was driving a Mazda SUV on Monday morning when it was involved in a crash with a cement truck. Prahastono and her two year-old-son Kai died at the scene, while critically injured Ivy was taken to hospital. The 48-year-old truck driver was not injured. Police are investigating the crash and have urged anyone with dashcam vision in the area at the time or anyone with further information to come forward. Morrison says China threat was ‘top’ reason for Aukus subs Former prime minister Scott Morrison has admitted that China’s rapid military expansion was “at the top of the list” of reasons why the United States gave Australia access to closely guarded nuclear submarine secrets under the Aukus pact. In an interview with the ABC’s 7.30 program last night, Morrison said his reasoning for pursuing the nuclear subs deal was to prevent war with China. “It was a combination of events but that was certainly at the top of the list,” he told host Sarah Ferguson, when she asked if China’s rapid rise was the reason the United States finally shared their nuclear secrets. Asked if he was contemplating a future war with China when planning the Aukus deal in 2021, Morrison responded: No, not necessarily. It was more about planning the situation that we would prevent such an outcome and to prevent such an outcome you needed this capability. You needed the counter-balancing influence within the Indo-Pacific that this would produce. The goal here ... was providing an enduring strategic counter-balance. To achieve that, you need these capabilities. Morrison also confirmed reports he had initially kept the Aukus pact secret from even his own cabinet ministers, besides defence ministers Linda Reynolds and Peter Dutton, and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne. Morning. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day’s news. I’ll bring you some of the best overnight breaking stories before my colleague Natasha May takes over. The fallout from the Aukus submarine deal is very much top of the news agenda this morning, with China describing the scheme as a “path of error and danger”. The comments by the Chinese foreign ministry highlight the increasingly clear divide across Asia-Pacific with the US, Australia and UK recalibrating western defence capabilities in the region to counter what is seen as Beijing’s bellicose stance on Taiwan. Former prime minister Scott Morrison told ABC’s 7.30 that the threat from China was “top of the list” of reasons for buying the nuclear subs. We’ve got more on what he said coming up. Climate activists have been stepping up action against Woodside Energy, including defacing its Perth offices in protest against the alleged destruction of ancient First Nations art in the Burrup Peninsula. Now three members of the board face a fight for re-election at next month’s AGM after shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, alongside institutional investors – industry superannuation fund Vision Super and fund manager Betashares – said this morning they had lost faith in the directors and would hold them to account for lacking a clear climate strategy. Financial analysts reckon that the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank has slashed the chances of the RBA raising the cash rate next month for what would be the 11th month in a row. The bank’s demise has forced a sharp selloff in banking shares across the world, including in Australia, and appears to have clouded the outlook for western economies. Shares rallied on Wall Street but the markets are jittery and the ASX could be in for a rocky ride today after dropping 1.4% yesterday. Into the bargain, Facebook parent Meta is sacking a further 10,000 workers.

Data, formal speeches, slide decks, clever debating points and tools of close analysis all have their place – but the trump card in persuasion and winning hearts and minds is a good story. To win is to have owned the best narrative. Get the message wrong and it turns into an unbelievable, losing fairytale. Thus, one of the reasons the Russians will ultimately fail in Ukraine is as much their weak story as any military frailties, while the Ukrainian account in response is so strong. Few, even inside Russia, believe Vladimir Putin’s story that Ukraine was always and immutably Russian, justifying such death and destruction to reassimilate it into its “natural” motherland. It’s an evil fable. Ukraine’s counter narrative – that it is fighting for its sovereignty and freedom before an unprovoked aggressor – is genuinely more credible. So when last week there was claim and counter-claim about the drones that attacked the Kremlin in an alleged assassination attempt on Putin, the bar of neutral opinion sided with the more successful storyteller – Ukraine. A successful narrative has to have roots in reality and involve struggle against obstacles – the participants so gaining wisdom. Even economists, the lovers of data, spreadsheets and charts above any other, are increasingly recognising the value and importance of narratives. Yale University’s Nobel prize-winning Professor Robert Shiller has even written a book about it, Narrative Economics. Throughout history, he writes, human beings have found themselves telling similar stories about new technologies threatening or creating jobs, about economies needing more conspicuous consumers or more frugal housewives or insisting that the integrity of money needs to be anchored in something independent of government, because governments cannot be trusted. Economists need to learn to go with the flow. Economic and political stories overlap and feed off one another. Since the late 1970s, the political right has been the most adept at borrowing from familiar and homespun narratives to build a nearly unassailable rightwing economic common sense. Wealth creation is about individual entrepreneurs taking risks, the most admirable activity of all. They flourish best when taxes are low and governments are small, keeping tight control of what they spend like any frugal household – and certainly not debasing the coinage by printing money. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher told this story – neither Bill Clinton nor Barack Obama nor Tony Blair managed successfully to challenge it. But President Joe Biden is pulling off what they failed to do – constructing a new and successful story to succeed the right’s. It’s why even at 80 he is so politically important, and his decision to run again – despite the risks – is so justified. He promises, like story-changing Reagan and Roosevelt before him, to be the author of an era-defining narrative. His key verb is “to build”. It’s an end to the claims of trickle-down economics, he says, which claims ultimately to benefit all. Instead, “we will build from the bottom up and middle out, not the top down”. When he hears the word climate, he likes to say he hears the word jobs. A recent speech by his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, defined the encompassing nature of Biden’s rupture with the old story – and the ambition of the new. It was simply breathtaking. First, it was emblematic that the story was told by a national security adviser: economic, foreign and security policy now going hand in hand. The US, Sullivan declared, had messed up in the previous 40 years. It had bought the narrative that free markets at home and abroad would spread capital most effectively, creating prosperity and bringing the world together. The story had turned into a malevolent fable. What it meant in practice was “the privileging of finance over fundamental economic growth, which was a mistake”. Too much free trade had undermined sectors that delivered middle-class jobs, which instead had been hollowed out, with supply chains and entire industries moving overseas and creating disillusion, disaffection and undermining democracy – a not very veiled reference to Donald Trump. Russia and China had seized the opportunity to subsidise their industries and, rather than making peace, were now aggressively challenging the US. The old story, instead of creating order, had created its opposite. The tax cuts and business deregulation preached by the rightwing supply-siders have failed totally, said Sullivan. The new Biden approach was to deploy government spending on a vast scale to trigger investment in new and green technologies, which would bring supply chains and industries back to the US, create middle-class jobs and enhance security and democracy. It was working, he said. Large-scale investment in semiconductors and green, clean technologies had jumped 20 times since 2019, implying a $3.5tn boost to investment in the decade ahead. There would be carefully structured trade deals with the EU and Pacific countries; Britain was not mentioned once. The aim was not to confront China but to become less dependent on her. In the end, he declared, we all rise or fall together. This is an emphatic new story – and it will have ramifications here. The Tory party is in trouble because its Brexit, tax-cut, end-the-nanny-state stories are ageing, failing and turning into disliked, unbelieved fairytales amid so much economic and social wreckage. The banking crisis in the US – surging again after Trump’s round of deregulation – is another reminder that the world of dropping regulatory “burdens” and expanding freeports has run its course. After the drubbing at the local elections, some shaken Tory politicians call for a return to “real conservatism” – but what does that mean? A conference of National Conservatism – or “NatCon” – in London on 15 May purports to answer the question. But its story, judging by a joint article by two of its speakers, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Frost, is to reaffirm the philosophy that the US national security adviser declares is provenly wrong and defunct. It does not rise to any of today’s challenges; instead it causes them. Into this vacant space the Labour party should step with its nascent story. Following Sullivan, there is a highly developed one to hand – to build for a better shared future. It may be shamelessly copying Biden, but copying winners is no bad strategy for wannabe successful storytellers. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some key links and developments from the day: The Washington Post reported that a foreign power’s nuclear secrets were among classified documents found by the FBI at former president Donald Trump’s Florida residence. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe said the revelation showed federal agents “absolutely had to go in” to retrieve the intelligence, while Shawn Turner, former director of communications for US national intelligence, said knowledge Trump was hoarding classified nuclear documents was a “gamechanger with regard to the risk it poses to our national security”. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in Palm Beach, Florida, is a magnet for foreign spies, former intelligence officials have warned. Barack and Michelle Obama returned to the White House for the unveiling of their official portraits. The former president paid tribute to his successor Joe Biden, while the former first lady said the unveiling showed “there’s a place for everyone in this country”. Former Trump administration defense secretaries Jim Mattis and Mark Esper have joined a group of retired military officers who have written an open letter warning of an “extremely adverse environment” for the military – a thinly-veiled attack on the former president’s efforts to use servicemen and women to advance his political goals. Massachusetts is on course to elect its first woman and first gay governor after Maura Healey won the Democratic primary on Tuesday and a Trump-backed candidate, Geoff Diehl, won the Republican contest to face her. A federal judge in Texas ruled today that employers can refuse to cover HIV infection prevention drugs. A judge struck down Michigan’s 1931 anti-abortion law, months after suspending it. A US senator has dismissed an Israeli army report that claims a soldier accidentally killed the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh in the midst of a gun battle, saying it is unsupported by the evidence, my colleague Chris McGreal reports: Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator for Maryland, repeated his call for an independent US investigation into Abu Aqleh’s killing in the West Bank in May, saying that the United Nations and reconstructions by major news outlets found that the Al Jazeera television journalist was not in the immediate vicinity of fighting with Palestinian militants and could not have been caught in the crossfire. On Monday, more than four months after her killing, Israel finally admitted it was “highly probable” that an Israeli soldier shot Abu Aqleh while she was reporting on a military raid on the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. The report said Abu Aqleh was probably shot by an Israeli soldier who was under fire from a group of Palestinian gunmen. It claimed the soldier was using a telescopic sight and misidentified her as one from his armed opponents. The army said no crime was committed so no one will be prosecuted. However, eyewitness accounts and videos of Abu Aqleh and the area around her at the time of her killing do not show a gun battle. She was also wearing body armour and a helmet clearly labelled as “press”. A United Nations investigation said that Israeli soldiers fired “several single, seemingly well-aimed bullets” at Abu Aqleh and other journalists. A federal judge in Texas ruled today that employers can refuse to cover HIV infection prevention drugs if they claim that it violates their religious beliefs. My colleague Maya Yang reports: US district judge Reed O’Connor on Wednesday ruled in favor of Braidwood Management, a Christian-owned company based in Texas, saying it was not required to cover the cost of Truvada and Descovy, two pre-exposure prophylactic drugs also known as PrEP. The drugs, which are taken every day by hundreds of thousands of Americans, are used to prevent HIV transmission and are made available through company health insurance via provisions for preventive healthcare in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A lawsuit filed by the conservative former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell on behalf of Braidwood Management against the US Department of Health and Human Services argued that the ACA provision “violated [the plaintiffs’] religious beliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and woman”, in the words of the judge. Mitchell is also known for designing Texas’s highly restrictive abortion law. O’Connor ruled in favor of the company. “Defendants outline a generalized policy to combat the spread of HIV, but they provide no evidence connecting that policy to employers such as Braidwood, nor do they provide evidence distinguishing potential religious exemptions from existing secular exemptions,” O’Connor said in his ruling. Some additional context here: And the full story: A judge today struck down a 1931 anti-abortion law in Michigan, months after suspending it, saying, “A law denying safe, routine medical care not only denies women of their ability to control their bodies and their lives – it denies them of their dignity. Michigan’s Constitution forbids this violation of due process.” The law had long been inactive prior to the overturning of Roe v Wade and made it illegal to perform abortions unless there was a life-threatening emergency. Judge Elizabeth Gleicher said the law “compels motherhood”, prevents a woman from determining the “shape of her present and future life” and “forces a pregnant woman to forgo her reproductive choices and to instead serve as ‘an involuntary vessel entitled to no more respect than other forms of collectively owned property’”. Michigan’s Democratic governor praised the ruling, but warned it was likely to be challenged and said there were “extremists who will stop at nothing to ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest”. The decision comes amid an ongoing court battle that will determine whether another anti-abortion measure is on the ballot before voters in Michigan this year. The full story on Gleicher’s decision: Hi all, Sam Levin here in Los Angeles taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. A new report suggests that hundreds of US law enforcement officers, elected officials and military personnel were listed on leaked documents as members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group linked to the January 6 insurrection. The Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism reviewed 38,000 leaked names on a membership list of the group and said it identified more than 370 people believed to be active members of police agencies, in addition to more than 100 people currently in the military, the AP reports. The review also identified more than 80 people running for office or currently serving as elected officials as of this summer. The list included sheriffs and police chiefs, the AP said. Some of the officials contacted by the AP responded they were members years ago but were no longer active. In recent years, there has been escalating concerns about links between police departments and far-right extremist groups in the US, a problem that was widely scrutinized after the insurrection, where off-duty officers were present. Last week, a retired New York police officer received the longest sentence yet for his involvement in the attack on the Capitol, during which he assaulted an officer with a flagpole. The full story on the Oath Keepers leak: Certain prominent legal experts aren’t pulling their punches this afternoon, already skeptical of the ruling by the federal judge in Florida granting Donald Trump’s request to have a special master interrupt and oversee the Department of Justice’s review of documents seized by the FBI from the former president’s residence at Mar-a-Lago. Harvard’s Laurence Tribe, as pithy as usual, has quote tweeted former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann over what needs to happen next in the court case – and not long after. Tribe wrote for the Guardian today that the ruling two days ago on the special master by Aileen Cannon, the federal judge in West Palm Beach, “has to rank high in the annals of the worst reasoned judicial decisions in American history”. He warns: “If it signals that judicial Trumpism has spread more broadly than we thought, there may be danger ahead to our entire system of equal justice.” Tribe wrote the piece with former federal prosecutor Dennis Aftergut and you can read the rest of it here. Tribe also notes that Trump’s attorney general Bill Barr has called Cannon’s ruling “deeply flawed”. (Barr also called it “a crock of shit”.) But he adds in a tweet: “I’m glad Bill Barr is making the rounds on his “dismantle Trump” tour, but if it’s a “rehabilitate Barr” tour, count me out.” The rehab tour started in earnest with the main round of January 6 hearings, and no matter what it does or doesn’t do for Barr, his testimony to that House committee’s inquiry did a lot for the congressional investigation itself (as well as for Ivanka Trump’s view of who won the 2020 election, apparently). Reporters at the White House press briefing are wondering if the US has had contact with any other countries over the reported discovery of a foreign power’s nuclear secrets among classified documents hoarded by ex-president Donald Trump. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is sticking closely to her previous position of flat-out refusing to comment on the justice department’s investigation into Trump’s handling of secret material, but does say this: We don’t have any calls to foreign governments to read out at this time on this particular issue as known. When it comes to this specific issue, the ODNI [office of the director of national intelligence] is in the middle of an assessment, and DoJ [justice department] is in the middle of an ongoing criminal investigation. So I’m not going to comment. It should be noted that Jean-Pierre is not saying no such calls have taken place, nor is she saying they have. She’s just saying that she has nothing that she can share. We’ve hopped across the White House from the East Room to the briefing room, to join press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Monkeypox is first on the agenda. Robert Fenton, White House national monkeypox response coordinator, says the country has ample supplies of vaccines to supply the most at-risk. “Our focus is to reach the remainder of the eligible population where they are,” he says, citing the success of thousands of doses being administered over the weekend at pride events in Louisiana, Georgia and elsewhere. “These events demonstrate our strategy is working.” Dr Demetre Daskalakis, deputy response coordinator, says the population at highest risk is largely men who have sex with other men. “It’s important people know a safe and effective vaccine is available for those who need it,” he says. “It’s important we speak to the community in a way that doesn’t stigmatize them. [The virus] doesn’t distinguish between people based on their sexual orientation or gender.” Michelle Obama’s speech from her portrait unveiling at the White House is worth a read. The day, the former first lady said, belongs not to her or Barack Obama, and it’s not even about the paintings: Too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in. They have to make a lot of money, or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to matter. But what we’re looking at today, a portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name and the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay at home mom, what we are seeing is a reminder that there’s a place for everyone in this country. Because, as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too. That is what this country is about. It’s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It’s a place where everyone should have a fair shot. Whether you’re a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school, or a single mother who’s working two jobs to put some food on the table. Or an immigrant, just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed of. That’s why for me this day isn’t about me or Barack. It’s not even about these beautiful paintings. It’s about telling that fuller story, a story that includes every single American in every single corner of the country so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves. And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division, and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart, that what we share, as my husband continues to say, is so much bigger than what we don’t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences. Joe Biden has tweeted about his “old pals act” at the White House on Wednesday, the vice-president turned president greeting his former boss Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama for the unveiling of their portraits. “Someone once said that if you’re looking for a friend in Washington get a dog,” Obama said during his speech in the East Room. “Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true friend. “Joe, it is now America’s good fortune to have you as president”. Mar-a-Lago – the Palm Beach resort and residence where Donald Trump reportedly stored nuclear secrets among a trove of highly classified documents for 18 months since leaving the White House – is a magnet for foreign spies, former intelligence officials have warned. The Washington Post reported that a document describing an unspecified foreign government’s defences, including its nuclear capabilities, was one of the many highly secret papers Trump took away from the White House when he left office in January 2021. There were also documents marked SAP, for Special-Access Programmes, which are often about US intelligence operations and whose circulation is severely restricted, even among administration officials with top security clearance. Potentially most disturbing of all, there were papers stamped HCS, Humint Control Systems, involving human intelligence gathered from agents in enemy countries, whose lives would be in danger if their identities were compromised. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is conducting a damage assessment review which is focused on the sensitivity of the documents, but US officials said it is the job of FBI counter-intelligence to assess who may have gained access to them. That is a wide field. The home of a former president with a history of being enthralled by foreign autocrats, distrustful of US security services, and boastful about his knowledge of secrets, is an obvious foreign intelligence target. “I know that national security professionals inside government, my former colleagues, [they] are shaking their heads at what damage might have been done,” John Brennan, former CIA director, told MSNBC. “I’m sure Mar-a-Lago was being targeted by Russian intelligence and other intelligence services over the course of the last 18 or 20 months, and if they were able to get individuals into that facility, and access those rooms where those documents were and made copies of those documents, that’s what they would do.” Barack Obama also thanked artists Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung for their respective portraits of himself and Michelle Obama. “He captures every wrinkle of your face, every crease of your shirt, [and] you’ll note he refused all of my requests to make my ears smaller,” he said. “He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way,” he added to laughter and applause, a nod to the social media firestorm he created back in 2014 when he wore one. “What you realize when you’re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that presidents and first ladies are human beings. “I’ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. “The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race. Having unveiled his portrait, Barack Obama is now paying tribute to Joe Biden, saying it is “America’s good fortune” to have him as president: You have guided us through some perilous times, you have built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice and to promote economic fairness. Thanks to you our faith in our democracy and the American people, the country is better off than when you took office. He also acknowledged his aides, staffers and colleagues from his time in the White House. Many are in the audience in the East Room: For eight years, even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and dedication and your goodness. You inspired me and I never wanted to disappoint you. Even during the toughest times it was all of you that kept me going. It’s good to be back and see all of you…what’s been a special joy to see what’s happened since. [But] I am a little disappointed I haven’t heard anyone naming a kid Barack yet. “Or Michelle…” the former first lady interjected from beside him. Joe Biden is acknowledging Barack Obama as his inspiration for everything he does as president. Speaking at the official unveiling of the former president and first lady, Michelle Obama, at the White House, Biden said: With Barack as our president we got up every day and went to work full of hope, for real, full of purpose, and excited about the possibility before us. Few people I’ve ever known have more integrity, decency, and moral courage than Barack Obama. Mr President, nothing could have prepared me better, and more, to become president of the United States than to be your side for eight years. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. No matter what the issue was, no matter how difficult, no matter what it was about, you never did what it was the easy way, the easy way out. It was never about doing it that way, it was always about doing what was right. To that end, Biden cited Obama’s signature achievement, passage of the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, which survived a bumpy passage and overcame Republican opposition in the Senate to become law: He never gave up on the simple truth that health care was a right for all Americans when so many were telling him, including me at one point, take the compromise, take the compromise… we weren’t sure we get anything done. You refused. You went big. And now the Affordable Care Act is there permanently and it’s even being improved. Here are the portraits: Joe Biden is speaking at the White House, where he is unveiling the official portraits of former first lady Michelle Obama, and 44th president Barack Obama, whom he served as vice-president. “Barack and Michelle, welcome home,” the president began. Here’s a video interview with the portraits’ artists, Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung. New York state is ending a 28-month-old Covid-19 mandate requiring masks on trains, buses and other modes of public transit, governor Kathy Hochul said at a news conference today, Reuters reports. Starting today masks will be optional. We have to restore some normalcy to our lives...Masks are encouraged but optional,” Hochul said, citing recent revised guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). New York first adopted the mandate in April 2020 as Covid-19 was rampaging in the New York City area. It’s always been a visible reminder that something is not normal here, and it was there for the right reason. It protected health and now we’re in a far different place,” Hochul said. In April, the Biden administration decided to no longer enforce a US mask mandate on public transportation after a federal judge in Florida ruled the directive was unlawful. New York declined to adopt the Biden policy in April. In recent months, many riders in New York had stopped observing the mask policy. Hochul said masks will still be required in some places like adult care facilities and some other medical facilities. The US Justice Department appealed the Florida judge’s ruling invalidating the transportation mask mandate, but a federal appeals court has not yet set the case for oral arguments. It’s been a lively morning in US political news and there’s more to come. The unveiling at the White House of the official portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama is just ahead, with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in attendance, and the White House press briefing with Karine Jean-Pierre follows not long after that. We’ll be watching for any other significant breaking news and will bring it to you as it happens. Here’s where things stand: Former Trump administration defense secretaries Jim Mattis and Mark Esper have joined a group of retired military officers who have written an open letter warning of an “extremely adverse environment” for the military – a thinly-veiled attack on the former president’s efforts to use servicemen and women to advance his political goals. Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI says federal agents “absolutely had to go in” to retrieve highly classified documents from Donald Trump’s private residence relating to the nuclear secrets of a foreign power. Donald Trump’s legal jeopardy could be heightened by the reported discovery of a foreign nation’s nuclear secrets among his hoard of improperly retained classified materials, some experts believe. The reported discovery of information about a foreign nation’s nuclear secrets in materials found at Donald Trump’s private residence in the FBI search last month is horrifying intelligence experts. The legal and security situation was already extremely serious and the further revelation has been called “a gamechanger”. Massachusetts is on course to elect its first woman and first gay governor after Maura Healey won the Democratic primary on Tuesday and a Trump-backed candidate, Geoff Diehl, won the Republican contest to face her. Healey, the state attorney general, said: “I am honored to receive the Democratic nomination … Together, we’re going to win in November and build a Massachusetts that works for everyone.” Massachusetts has a long record of electing moderate Republicans. Only one Democrat – Deval Patrick, from 2007 to 2015 – has been governor since 1991. Healey, a former college and professional basketball player, has been attorney general since 2015. Polls give her huge leads over Diehl. The Republican backs Donald Trump’s lie that his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election was the result of electoral fraud, opposed the extension of mail-in voting, opposed public health mandates in the Covid pandemic and supports the supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that guaranteed the right to abortion. The abortion issue alone has driven electoral successes that have Democrats hoping they can prosper in the midterm elections. On Monday, Trump – the de facto leader of a party dominated by supporters Biden has called “semi-fascist” – told Massachusetts Republicans that Diehl would push back against “ultra-liberal extremists” and “rule your state with an iron fist”. Full-story: Former Trump administration defense secretaries Jim Mattis and Mark Esper have joined a group of retired military officers who have written an open letter warning of an “extremely adverse environment” for the military – a thinly-veiled attack on the former president’s efforts to use servicemen and women to advance his political goals. “Military officers swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, not an oath of fealty to an individual or to an office,” the letter, published by the online security analysis website War on the Rocks, states. It is signed by eight former secretaries of defense, serving both Republican and Democratic administrations, and five retired generals or admirals who are former chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Martin Dempsey, who served in the Obama administration from 2011 to 2015. The letter does not mention Trump by name, but refers to a “disruption” in the transfer of power from one administration to the other. Trump is the only president in modern history to fail to acknowledge his successor’s victory and commit to handing over his administration peacefully. “Politically, military professionals confront an extremely adverse environment characterized by the divisiveness of affective polarization that culminated in the first election in over a century when the peaceful transfer of political power was disrupted and in doubt,” the letter says. “Looking ahead, all of these factors could well get worse before they get better.” Polling oracle FiveThirtyEight has calculated that more than 50% of US voters will have an election denier somewhere on the ballot during November’s midterms. Researchers drew on “news reports, debate footage, campaign materials and social media and reached out to every single Republican nominee for the House, Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general to determine their position on the 2020 election”. Of 529 total Republican nominees running for office, FiveThirtyEight found 195 it says fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election by either stating the election was stolen from Donald Trump, or taking legal action to overturn the results including voting not to certify election results or joining lawsuits that sought to overturn the election.

Barack Obama will reunite with his former vice-president Joe Biden at the White House at lunchtime when the 44th US president and his wife Michelle return for the unveiling of their official portraits. Large, formal portraits of presidents and first ladies adorn walls, hallways and rooms throughout the White House and, customarily, a former president returns for the unveiling during his successor’s tenure. But the Obamas, who have remained popular since leaving the political limelight, did not have their ceremony while Donald Trump held power, as this Reuters report states. Before winning election in 2016 and succeeding Obama in 2017, Trump was a longtime proponent of the “birther” movement that falsely suggested Obama was not born in the US. A spokesperson for Obama declined to comment on the timing of the Obamas’ portrait unveilings. The White House Historical Association president, Stewart McLaurin, said there was no prescribed process for presidential portraits. “It’s really up to the current president in the White House and the former president that is portrayed in the portrait to determine the right moment, but there is no set timeline,” he said. Obama hosted former president George W Bush and his wife, Laura, for their portrait unveilings in 2012, during Obama’s first term. The Obamas and Bidens became close during Obama’s presidency, going through the ups and downs of their political and personal lives, including the death of Biden’s son, Beau, from cancer. The former deputy director of the FBI says federal agents “absolutely had to go in” to retrieve highly classified documents from Donald Trump’s private residence relating to the nuclear secrets of a foreign power. Andrew McCabe, whom Trump fired in 2018 before the justice department reversed the decision last year, also said the reported discovery dispelled claims from the former president’s legal team that it had been openly negotiating the return of hoarded documents to the National Archives. McCabe told CNN on Wednesday: The seriousness of the documents eliminates any question about whether or not the department and the FBI actually had to go in with a search, which at the time was perceived as this overly aggressive move taken out of the blue, without any sort of appropriate wind up. Of course, we now know that that’s not true. We know that the parties were not negotiating in good faith. We know that the folks on the Trump team were misleading the government… [and] resisted the return of these documents for basically a year and a half. Knowing what was in there, they absolutely have to go in and recover this material. It’s essential to national security. Top former Trump strategist Steve Bannon is expected to be indicted on Thursday on state fraud charges connected to his role in a fundraising scheme to build a border wall, according to two sources familiar with the matter, years after he received a presidential pardon in the federal case. The expected move by the Manhattan district attorney’s office was quietly communicated to Bannon in recent days, the sources said of the sealed indictment, and indicated the state charges will likely mirror the federal case in which he was pardoned. Bannon and three others were charged in that case by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with falsely claiming that they would not take compensation in the private “We Build the Wall” fundraising effort to underwrite part of the construction of the wall on the US-Mexico border. The architect of Trump’s 2016 election campaign and later White House adviser was accused of personally taking more than $1m from what people had donated to the fundraising push that promised to secure funding in order to ensure the completion of the border wall. Bannon – alongside disabled veteran Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea – raised more than $25m in the online crowdfunding effort, which also promised donors that all of the proceeds would go towards constructing the wall. Though Bannon pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in August 2020, two others, Kolfage and Badolato, pleaded guilty to siphoning off money from the scheme and defrauding others for their own gain. Bannon received a last-minute pardon in the final days of the Trump administration that expunged the federal indictment. But presidential pardons do not apply to state-level charges. The Manhattan district attorney’s office started examining whether to pursue a case against Bannon almost immediately after he received the pardon, one source with knowledge of the matter said, and several close Bannon allies were subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury in recent months. Read the full story: Donald Trump’s legal jeopardy could be heightened by the reported discovery of a foreign nation’s nuclear secrets among his hoard of improperly retained classified materials, some experts believe. Michael Moore, former US attorney for Georgia, was asked on CNN if the finding could provide the justice department – which is conducting a criminal investigation into the former president’s handling of secret documents – with more evidence to bring charges: I really think that’s probably the case. The documents that they had dealing with national defense may have been enough as it was under the Espionage Act, [which] doesn’t really require classified materials to be held and stolen. It [only] required defense information. This information about nuclear capabilities and defense is particularly troubling to me, and there’s no good way to spin it for the [ex]-president. The three blind mice would say that he’s in trouble with this at this point. Conversely, Moore added, the apparent leaking to the media about the content of the papers seized by the FBI in their search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida last month had “justified” one aspect of his legal defense: I’m worried about is how the news is getting information about what the documents are. It seems to me that Trump’s request for a special master is justified, because somebody somewhere is leaking information about the specifics of these highly classified, highly sensitive documents. That may change the dynamics, not just on the criminal side, but also the legal side. Senior Democrats, intelligence experts and retired senior military officers are among those offering thoughts this morning on the alleged discovery of a foreign power’s nuclear secrets at Donald Trump’s Florida residence. Adam Schiff, representative for California and chair of the House intelligence committee: Mark Hertling, retired US Army lieutenant general and national security analyst: Democratic congressman for California, Ted Lieu: John W Dean, White House counsel for Richard Nixon during Watergate crisis: Donald Trump doesn’t seem too concerned that information about a foreign nation’s nuclear capabilities was reportedly found at his Florida mansion. The former president, according to a post on his troubled Truth Social network this morning, would seem to indicate he’s more worried by federal agents having sight of his medical records. “At least they’ll see that I’m very healthy, an absolutely perfect physical specimen!” wrote Trump, who has a questionable history at best over claims about his weight and overall health. “Not only did the FBI steal my Passports in the FBI Raid and Break-In of my home, Mar-a-Lago, but it has just been learned through court filings that they also improperly took my complete and highly confidential medical file and history, with all the bells and whistles. “Plus personal Tax Records (Illegal to take), and lawyer/client/privileged information, a definite NO, NO. Days of the Soviet Union! The reported discovery of information about a foreign nation’s nuclear secrets in materials found at Donald Trump’s private residence is horrifying intelligence experts. Federal agents seized the document during their search of Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s Palm Beach mansion in Florida, last month, the Washington Post reported. It appears to confirm officials’ worst fears about the nature of the intelligence he should have returned to the National Archives. Shawn Turner, former director of communications for US national intelligence, was searing in his criticism during an interview Wednesday on CNN’s New Day: The fact we now know there were highly classified, restricted access documents about another country’s nuclear defense capabilities stored at Mar-a-Lago is a gamechanger with regard to the risk it poses to our national security. That these documents may have been seen by unauthorized personnel … tells individuals what our capabilities are with regard to intelligence collection related to nuclear programs. More important is it identifies or exposes our gaps with regard to intelligence collection. The bottom line is others are going to look at this information and determine what we know and don’t know, and they’re going to make decisions about their nuclear programs based on that information. And that is an extremely dangerous thing. The Post’s reporting is only the latest twist in a weeks-long saga over the justice department’s investigation into his handling of classified materials after he left office in January 2021. Trump, who is mulling another run for the presidency in 2024, attacked the department at a weekend rally where he called the FBI and DoJ “vicious monsters”. Many others, including Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have defended the investigation into his retention of government records, saying that it posed a major national security risk. Read more: Good morning US politics blog readers! Wednesday begins with another extraordinary development in the saga of Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Florida residence. Among the papers found by the FBI during a search last month was one describing a foreign government’s nuclear capabilities, the Washington Post reported. It would appear to confirm security officials’ worst fears about the nature of the material the former president refused to hand back to the National Archives. We’ll be watching for reaction. There’s also increasing scrutiny and growing criticism of the judge in the case, Trump appointee Aileen Cannon, who made the decision to appoint an independent special master to review the evidence in the justice department’s inquiry. Some legal scholars question the legitimacy of the unprecedented decision, saying it places Trump above the law. Bill Barr, Trump’s former attorney general, was more succinct, telling the New York Times: “It’s a crock of shit.” Here’s what else we’re watching today: Steve Bannon, Trump’s former senior strategist who is already awaiting sentencing for contempt of Congress after refusing to cooperate with the January 6 trial, is expected to be indicted on fraud charges relating to a fundraising scheme. Barack and Michelle Obama return to the White House at 1.30pm for the unveiling of their official portraits, hosted by Joe and Jill Biden.

It’s hard to say just yet what exact impact artifical intelligence might have on our lives but it’s already causing a headache for the government. Our smart data experts have figured out that the voice identification systems used by the agencies such as Centrelink and the ATO to control phone access to accounts can be duped by AI-generated audio. We’ve got the full exclusive story, plus the latest on the Aukus controversy, and why this Friday the Cure are not in love with ticket rorts. Australia Covid spike | New South Wales is experiencing a rise in Covid-19 cases, with one expert warning the data indicates early signs of a new wave with a “patchwork quilt” of variants. Exclusive | A voice identification system used by the government has a serious security flaw, a Guardian Australia investigation has found. Centrelink and the ATO both give people the option of using a “voiceprint” to verify their identity over the phone. But using just four minutes of audio, our reporter was able to generate a clone of their own voice and use it, combined with their customer reference number, to gain access to their own Centrelink self-service account. Aukus anger | Unions and business groups in Wollongong are angry about reports Port Kembla could be the east coast base for the subs, warning it could displace offshore wind and container terminal jobs. A Chinese embassy official asked Australian counterparts during an Aukus briefing whether the nuclear-powered submarines were intended for “sightseeing”, according to sources, causing confusion about whether it was meant sarcastically or not. Voice progress | The two bills needed for the Indigenous voice referendum are on track for the coming parliamentary fortnight, ministers insist, despite its expert group of Aboriginal leaders still finalising its crucial advice to cabinet. Spiritual cost? | A Liberal party candidate in the NSW election has shared a post online saying Christian parents who sent their children to public schools were making “the most costly spiritual decision they’ve ever made”. World Borne ultimatum | The French government has used special powers to force through a rise in the pension age to 64 amid chaotic scenes in parliament in which leftwing MPs sang the Marseillaise to stop the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, from speaking. The reforms are seen as a decisive moment for President Emmanuel Macron. Drone collision | A video released by the Pentagon shows the moments before a Russian fighter crashed into a $32m US Reaper drone after spraying it with jet fuel on Tuesday morning over the Black Sea. Air power | Poland will deliver fighter jets to Ukraine in the next few days, marking a significant upward step in military backing for Kyiv in the lead-up to an expected counter-offensive. It comes as a UN-backed inquiry finds Russia has committed a wide range of war crimes in its attack on Ukraine. Euro hike | The European Central Bank has raised interest rates across the eurozone by 0.5 percentage points, despite fears that higher borrowing costs could destabilise the financial system amid fears about Credit Suisse. ‘Sickened’ Cure | Robert Smith of the Cure has told fans he is “sickened” after fans complained of Ticketmaster’s additional fees on sales of tickets for the band’s US tour – which reportedly exceeded the face value of the ticket.

Perhaps the BBC’s archive will now include the pre-production papers for last weekend’s Match of the Day shows, which would have been prepared before Gary Lineker was taken off air and his colleagues refused to appear. Those shows don’t strictly belong in a history of unseen TV as they did go out, more or less (mainly less). The nearest equivalent is the live MotD from 1977 in which the great commentator John Motson, who died last month, got his big chance – a debut FA Cup Final commentary – because David Coleman, the Lineker of his day, had been taken off air in a dispute with BBC Sport over his contract. Some of the most controversial TV shows in history were actually transmitted unaltered. Real Lives (BBC One, 1985), a documentary about Northern Irish rivals Gregory Campbell and Martin McGuinness, was delayed but shown intact after a BBC staff protest. In 1988, ITV’s Death on the Rock overcame attempts at suppression by the Thatcher government to suggest that three IRA members who were shot by the SAS during a Gibraltar mission had been unlawfully killed. But though the shows went out, so did the producers. Alasdair Milne, the BBC director general, was forced out in 1987 by the Tory-appointed chairman, Marmaduke Hussey, due to board concerns including the Real Lives documentary. Thames Television, the company behind Death on the Rock, lost its ITV licence in October 1991, in a bidding process constructed by the Thatcher government. Here is a timeline of shows that were dumped or significantly disrupted. Shows that went on (sort of) Match of the Day/Match of the Day 2 (BBC One/Two, 2023) This weekend’s Match of the Days – much shortened and shorn of the theme tune, commentary, presenter and pundits – have been described as unprecedented. They were certainly striking, but actually sit in a long line of schedule disruption caused by industrial action (of which the walk-out in support of Lineker is the latest example). During previous union disputes, a retired newsreader hosted Breakfast News for one day, while BBC managers falteringly operated cameras. This is never a good look and usually leads to swift restoration of normal broadcasting, as it has in the Lineker case. Sunday Grandstand (BBC Two, 1997) Hosted by Sue Barker, the Sunday edition of the magazine sports show was scheduled to start at noon on 31 August 1997 on BBC Two, including live action from the deciding round of the cricket Sunday League. But following the death of Princess Diana, the BBC screened the same live news service on both its TV channels, judging that any other coverage would be inappropriate. At lunchtime, as viewers realised they were being denied Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott reporting on Lancashire v Yorkshire and Kent v Hampshire, copious calls and emails to the BBC led them – neither for the first nor last time overestimating interest in a royal story – to rapidly reinstate sport from 3pm, although Barker was warned to be “solemn and respectful”. It is not yet clear if the make-do MotDs have replaced this as the most complained about BBC sports scheduling. Yesterday’s Men (BBC One, 1971) On his last day in Number 10, after losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath’s Conservatives, the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, gave an interview to David Dimbleby, then a 32-year-old BBC reporter. Dimbleby had the idea for a documentary about the sudden loss of political power. But Wilson was not told the provocative title, Yesterday’s Men, or that his finances and property purchases would be explored. After the film was previewed, the Labour leader threatened a legal injunction. The BBC eventually showed the film, though it omitted a section in which Dimbleby asked about the money received for his memoirs and the politician demanded that the cameras be stopped. The incident caused long-term problems for the corporation because Wilson turned out to be tomorrow’s man, becoming PM again in 1974. TV Eye: A Bitter Harvest (ITV, 1984) At a time of especially intense rivalry between the BBC and ITV, both current affairs operations urgently worked on stories about the devastating Ethiopian famine. Peter Gill, a film-maker with expertise in international development, made a documentary that was meant to go out ahead of an equivalent BBC film. When an ITV technicians’ strike halted work, unions refused to make an exception even for such subject matter. Eventually, unpaid volunteers were allowed to edit an emergency version, but transmission slipped. The BBC’s film, by Michael Buerk, alerted the world to the crisis, which led to mass charity efforts including Live Aid. Shows that didn’t go on The War Game (1965, BBC) On the first Thursday in September 1965, the BBC director general, Hugh Greene, and chairman, Lord Normanbrook, sat together to watch a drama-documentary about the imagined aftermath of a nuclear attack, made by a 29-year-old production assistant called Peter Watkins. It was highly unusual for the corporation’s top two to preview shows, but they had followed the project from outline stage, given its potential to appal with images of people’s eyeballs melting in an incinerated Britain. Normanbrook, a former cabinet secretary, was officially politically neutral, but behaved, the official history of the BBC notes, “like a government official”, organising a screening for the Home Office and Ministry of Defence, after which the BBC board banned the film. Though it was given limited cinematic screenings from 1966, The War Game was not shown by the BBC until 1985. There is a popular narrative that editorial interference in the BBC is essentially Tory, but that is partly because Conservative governments are more common; it was under the Labour administration of Wilson that The War Game was banned. Brimstone and Treacle (BBC, 1976) In the late 70s, several of BBC One’s Play for Today dramas were dumped due to “sex and violence” (or both), the taboos popularised by morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Dennis Potter’s Brimstone and Treacle – in which a stranger who may be Satan rapes a tetraplegic young woman and appears to improve her condition – was written, filmed and scheduled for 6 April 1976. But a worried manager “referred upwards” and Alasdair Milne, then director of programmes (television), who found the play “repugnant”, banned it. After private screenings, both the Guardian and Daily Telegraph acclaimed the play as a complex fable about faith and evil, but the BBC would not resile, and Brimstone and Treacle was not screened until 1987. A film adaptation starring Sting was released in 1982. Scum (BBC, 1977) The Brimstone and Treacle debacle encouraged an “early warning synopsis system”, in which bosses were advised of contentious content. It next led Milne to bin Scum, a play about the brutal borstal system for young offenders, with David Threlfall, Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels in early roles. Scum wasn’t screened by the BBC until 1991, although its writer, Roy Minton, and director, Alan Clarke, remade it as a movie in 1979. Solid Geometry (BBC, 1979) A triple bill of deletions was completed by the “halting of production” on Solid Geometry, Ian McEwan’s adaptation of his short story featuring nude sex scenes and a man whose great-grandfather bought at auction a prodigious penis preserved in formaldehyde. The producer, W Stephen Gilbert, was sacked for speaking to the press, then reinstated but demoted. As McEwan wrote in a preface to the published text, Gilbert “ascended to headlines as TV SEX BOSS (ON CARPET). I sped in taxis to urgent conferences.” These three cancellations occurred under the Labour government of James Callaghan. But it is clear that the killed scripts of this era reflect an apprehension about the impending premiership of Margaret Thatcher, whose first term began two months after Solid Geometry’s cancellation. The legend is that a BBC manager yelled: “Margaret Thatcher is about to become prime minister and you’re trying to make a play with a fucking 12-inch pickled penis in a bottle!” Sin on Saturday (1982, BBC One) Bernard Falk, a perky reporter, sold himself as the host of a “summer replacement” late-Saturday-night studio show, in which one of the seven deadly sins would be discussed each week by studio guests, with an eighth edition debating the modern concept of transgression. Songs and sketches about temptation featured a young comedian called Robbie Coltrane. Editions on lust, covetousness and envy notably failed to rouse those feelings in viewers or reviewers, who saw the show as vulgar and cheap, and, after pushing back envy as close to closedown as possible, the BBC – where Milne was now director general – pulled the plug on gluttony, ending the series five shows short. Secret Society: The Secret Constitution (BBC One, 1986) The government was alarmed to discover that a BBC Scotland series made by the reporter Duncan Campbell included details of a secret satellite surveillance project called Zircon. Thatcher ordered a police raid on BBC Scotland to seize the films. After the dispute contributed to Milne’s removal, the BBC eventually screened the Zircon film in 1988, but an episode about cabinet committees – called The Secret Constitution – remains in a deep BBC vault, 36 years after it was made. Hardwicke House (ITV, 1987) This seven-part sitcom was set in a comprehensive school with a paedophile deputy head and a pupil who was a serial killer. Two episodes ran in February 1987, but viewer, media and political fury about such strong content in a comedy made this another victim of the Thatcherite culture wars. The final five episodes have never been shown. Gerry Adams (BBC, 1988-94) In an attempt to switch off what Thatcher called the “oxygen of publicity”, the British government banned from being broadcast the voices of allegedly pro-terrorist nationalist leaders in Northern Ireland. The BBC got round this by using actors to dub the words of Gerry Adams and others, bringing a usefully lucrative income stream for soundalike actors including Stephen Rea. Shows that went on … digitally Viewpoint (ITV Hub, 2021) Starring Noel Clarke as a surveillance detective, this five-parter was scheduled to fill ITV primetime from Monday to Friday, starting on 26 April 2021. But after the Guardian reported multiple allegations of sexual assault and intimidation against Clarke (which he denied), ITV pulled the fifth episode from the schedules, although made it available on the catch-up service ITV Hub – a pioneering use of having your censorship and cheating it. David Attenborough documentary (BBC iPlayer, 2023) Another use of this “split screen” approach will see Sir David Attenborough’s five-part series Wild Isles supplemented by a documentary about “re-wilding” that will only be available on iPlayer. Some BBC staff have suggested that a “sixth episode” was censored in case it upset rightwing anti-ecologists in government and elsewhere. But the film would irritate them just as much digitally, and the paper trail seems to show that the documentary was made separately and bought by the BBC as extra content for iPlayer, driving audiences there in line with its digital-first policy. • This article was amended on 14 March 2023. The caption of an image embedded in the story said it was Dennis Potter with Sting, “who co-starred in Brimstone and Treacle, in 1976”. Sting was not in the pulled television drama, but starred in the film version, released in 1982. The BBC documentary Real Lives was about Martin McGuinness and Gregory Campbell, not Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/29/first-thing-biden-hails-debt-ceiling-deal-prepares-congress-sell","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-29T10:28:51Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Biden hails debt ceiling deal, prepares Congress sell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/29/first-thing-biden-hails-debt-ceiling-deal-prepares-congress-sell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/29/first-thing-biden-hails-debt-ceiling-deal-prepares-congress-sell","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Joe Biden has said a bipartisan deal to raise the $31.4tn US debt ceiling and avoid a default is ready to move to Congress and urged lawmakers to pass the agreement he struck with Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the Republican-majority House. To reduce spending, as Republicans had insisted, the package includes a two-year budget deal that would hold spending flat for 2024 and impose limits for 2025. That’s in exchange for raising the debt limit for two years, until after the next election. But McCarthy’s far-right wing members are expected to balk at spending cuts that they deem not deep enough, while progressives may be more likely to choke down cuts and benefits restrictions that they loathe in order to pass the deal. Yesterday, McCarthy boasted on Fox News that “there’s not one thing in the bill for Democrats” even though Biden achieved his fundamental goal of persuading the Republican to agree to a debt ceiling increase. McCarthy predicted House GOP members will support the deal. “A deal that’s good news for the American people.” Biden hailed the agreement last night. “It takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table, protects our hard-earned and historic economic recovery,” he said. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wins Turkish presidential election Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has extended his two decades in power, securing victory over his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu after an unprecedented presidential runoff election, in a vote that reflected Turkey’s stark and persistent political polarisation. With 99.43% of the vote counted, Turkey’s supreme election authority announced late on Sunday that Erdoğan had won 52.14% of the votes, more than 2m more than his opponent, who received 47.86%. Even before the result was called, a triumphant Erdoğan stood on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul to once again sing a campaign song to his adherents and pronounce victory. “Look at this scene. It’s magnificent,” he said. “We have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our nation … Elections come and go, the flood goes away but the sand remains. The main thing is that our country does not deviate from its goals, and our nation takes care to remain united. This is the biggest message of today’s elections.” The victory for Turkey’s longest-serving leader affords him another term in office as president and an endorsement of his populist style of politics after he emerged victorious in an election that challenged his rule. Two decades in office. The Turkish leader has reshaped the country in his own image, concentrating power on his office, detaining opponents and instituting increasingly unorthodox economic policies. Despite this, he gained support in many of the areas of Turkey worst hit by the country’s financial troubles. Vacant skyscrapers, empty trains: can San Francisco once again reinvent itself? A newly built hub that was announced with great fanfare before the pandemic was supposed to ferry workers in from all over the region to downtown San Francisco. But it remains quiet, save for the metaphorical tumbleweeds. The city’s main public transport systems are collapsing under the weight of their own emptiness. The number of riders on the Bart system is about 30% of pre-pandemic levels for riders who exit in downtown San Francisco. Without a $5bn bailout, service cuts to some of the city’s transit lines could start as soon as this summer, writes Isabeau Doucet. Once home to some of the most expensive and sought-after office space in the world, San Francisco today is suffering from one of the most hollowed-out downtowns in North America. The emptiness has made some of the city’s other problems – an enduring homelessness emergency, open-air drug use in some neighborhoods and high rates of property crime – seem more visible. But part of the solution may lie in downtown’s emptiness. With high-rises full of empty office space, many artists and low- and middle-income residents priced out, and the most disadvantaged residents of the city housing themselves on its sidewalks, could this vacancy crisis be an opportunity to tackle this emergency in housing and homelessness? Working from home. A study comparing mobile phone data across 62 downtowns in North America found that San Francisco’s recovery was dead last, with only 31% of the activity it had pre-pandemic. In other news … Chinese courts prosecuted 8.3 million people in the five years to 2022, a 12% increase on the previous period. There was also a nearly 20% increase in the number of protests against court rulings. The figures give a glimpse of how China’s notoriously opaque justice system has operated in recent years, amid a tightening domestic security environment. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Guantánamo Bay prisoner tortured by the CIA after being alleged by the US to have plotted al-Qaida’s bombing of an American naval ship, has accused British intelligence agencies of complicity in his mistreatment in a case before one of UK’s most secretive courts. Japan’s military has said it will destroy any North Korean missile that violates its territory and is making preparations to do so, after Kim Jong-un’s regime told Tokyo it planned to launch what could be its first military satellite, which would enhance the country’s surveillance capability and improve its ability to strike targets in the event of war, between 31 May and 11 June. Stat of the day: Up to 70% of California beaches could disappear by end of the century California is known for golden sands and endless waves, but much of the state’s shoreline could vanish in the future. That’s according to a new study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed but echoes the findings of a previous investigation. It found that between 25% and 70% of California beaches might be washed away by the end of the century, leaving only cliffs or coastal infrastructure in their wake. The California Coastal Commission is already encouraging cities to harden their coastline by building seawalls or depositing large rocks that can help protect them from pounding waves, though sea walls can cause sand to erode faster from adjacent beaches. “Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,” wrote Sean Vitousek, the researcher who led the study. “Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.” Don’t miss this: Wave of lawsuits against US gun makers raises hope of end to mass shootings In New York, California, Delaware and other states, new laws aim to provide ways around a near 20-year immunity provided to gun manufacturers and distributors. In Indiana, a lawsuit brought by victims of the 2021 mass shooting at a FedEx facility aims to hold a gun manufacturer accountable for the horror wrought by one of its weapons. The emerging wave of lawsuits against gun makers echoes previous successes against the car industry, opioid companies and big tobacco, writes Adam Gabbatt. Huge financial penalties led companies to acknowledge the danger of their products and pushed them toward more responsible practices. The door was effectively opened for gun litigation last year, when the families of five adults and four children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting settled with Remington, which manufactured the AR-15 style rifle used in the massacre, for $73m. Other lawsuits like the Indianapolis action, brought by two survivors of the shooting and the family of a man killed, broadly argue that gun manufacturers, gun sellers and gun distributors bear responsibility for gun crimes because of the way they design, market and distribute their products and there is evidence the litigation could work to combat gun violence. … or this: Niger’s cycle of deadly violence raises questions over US counter-terror role When is a western security assistance deployment truly a success story? Niger, where jihadist groups have killed thousands in recent years, has been the largest recipient of state department military aid in west Africa and the second-largest in sub-Saharan Africa since 2002. The number of US personnel deployed to Niger has also jumped from 100 to 1,001 over the past 10 years. The US has also built a number of military or CIA outposts, including several bases to launch armed drones. But Elizabeth Shackelford, a former US state department foreign service officer who served in several posts in Africa, said that the steep rise in violent events in Niger – 43% over the past year – meant that hard questions must be asked. “At a minimum, more US security assistance isn’t leading to more security, and all signs suggest it plays a role in making matters worse,” she said. The US state department, making a mockery of the praise a US commander recently showered upon the Nigerien armed forces, recently said there had been numerous reports of arbitrary or unlawful executions by authorities or their agents. Climate check: Alberta’s party leaders are ignoring the climate crisis while the region burns Record-breaking wildfires have charred more than a million hectares of land in Alberta, pushing tens of thousands from their homes and choking the skies in a thick haze of smoke. But on the zigzagging campaign trail of the Canadian province’s general election, neither party leader has confronted the realities of climate change and how it will likely dramatically reshape life in the Canadian prairies. Instead, they’ve spent weeks sparring over taxation, healthcare – and one candidate’s deeply offensive remarks about transgender children. By all accounts, Alberta’s election on Monday is going to be a political nail-biter, a bitterly contested campaign filled with fears of party mutiny, allegations of judicial interference and an unprecedented political comeback. But for all the excitement of the race, political scientists are baffled that leaders have repeatedly shied away from confronting the realities of global heating. Last Thing: Inside the world’s longest-running mermaid gathering: ‘The first place I’ve truly belonged’ Hundreds gathered last weekend for the California Mermaid Convention: a three-day celebration of the increasingly popular practice of “mermaiding”. Part cosplay, part athletic endeavor, the hobby ranges from casual dress-up to certified divers who strap on “monofins” and swim together in a pool or the open ocean, writes Kari Paul. Above all, mermaids are an inclusive community working to maintain its magic as participation grows, thanks in part to easily accessible fins and excitement about Disney’s reboot of The Little Mermaid. Chè Monique, a mermaid based in the DC area, founded the Society of Fat Mermaids in 2018 and was drawn to a community where she said she always felt celebrated. She found the whimsical nature of mermaiding lends itself to expansive representations of many identities – and a desire to keep the space as safe as possible. “The mer-community is ultimately made up of adults doing very playful, creative stuff,” she said. “You’re already letting your personal vulnerability show, and letting your weird out, so it makes sense to want to protect your larger community,” she said.

Britain’s FTSE 100 index suffered its worst week since March 2020, falling 6.7%. Europe’s Euro Stoxx 600 index ended the week 7% lower, which was also the worst week since the coronavirus pandemic started. Germany’s Dax suffered a 10% weekly loss. The FTSE in London finished 251 points lower on Friday at 6,998, a 3.5% drop after the war in Ukraine escalated with a Russian attack on Europe’s biggest nuclear power station, Zaporizhzhia, which was then seized by Putin’s forces. The German and French stock markets fell more than 4%, taking the Dax in Frankfurt to its lowest levels since late 2020, while the Italian index tumbled 6.2% to its lowest level in more than a year. As stock markets slid, investors piled into investments regarded as safer – gold, currencies like the dollar and yen, and government bonds. British 10-year government bonds recorded their biggest weekly rise in more than a decade. As gilts were in demand, this pushed their yields, or returns to investors, down the most since November 2011 (when bond prices go up, yields go down). The Moscow stock exchange stayed closed all week, while the rouble fell to record lows amid wider sanctions on Russia. It hit an all-time low of 118.35 per dollar in Moscow on Thursday, and ended the week at 105 per dollar. Sterling lost 1% against the dollar to $1,3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments like the dollar and gold. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $1,965 an ounce. The euro slipped below the $1.10 level for the first time since May 2020, down 1.4%, after the Russian attack on the Ukrainian power station, Europe’s biggest. The single currency has also been hurt by growing risks to the European economy and the expectation the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates much faster than the European Central Bank. Fears of supply disruptions have sent commodity prices soaring. Aluminium has been hitting fresh record highs most days. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange touched a new all-time high of $3,850 on Friday and was on track for its biggest weekly gain ever, rising 13% so far. Nickel prices rose more than 13% over the week, the biggest weekly rise in August 2019. Wheat traded in Chicago, the global benchmark, has soared more than 50% since Russia invaded Ukraine over a week ago. Prices rose as high as $13.40 a bushel on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The global inflation shock has gained momentum this week with wheat prices rising to a 14-year high, corn prices to an 8-year high, and Brent crude prices hitting 10-year highs of $120 a barrel. The rise in agricultural commodity prices is particularly worrying given that the last time they were at these sorts of levels, we had the Arab Spring in 2012. Wholesale natural gas prices hit record highs. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) for delivery in April, a common benchmark for European gas, hit €200 for the first time, before settling back later in the day. Global food prices hit a record high in February, jumping 24% year-on-year, according to the UN food agency – even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here’s a selection of today’s top stories: Thank you for reading this week. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be back next week. Bye! – JK Here is our latest list of western sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Turning to the UK stock market, Hewson said: The FTSE 100 has also had a shocker of a week, posting its largest decline since March 2020, and below the 7,000 level to its lowest point since August last year. In terms of weekly performance, the best performers have been in defence, and commodities with weekly gains for BAE Systems, and the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta. Today’s sell-off has been broad based with travel and leisure getting hit hard as surging oil prices push up fuel costs for the airlines, as well as eroding consumers disposable incomes. While some airlines are partially hedged for rising fuel prices none of them are fully hedged. Eastern European based Wizz Air is once again on the receiving end of the heaviest losses. European banks are getting clobbered over concerns about the economic outlook for the European economy, rising inflation risk, and an ECB likely to remain behind the curve when it comes to raising rates. Amongst the worst performers French bank Société Générale is down over 25% this week, as is Italy’s UniCredit, while Deutsche Bank is down over 20%. UK banks have also been hit but their weekly losses have been more modest with Barclays down over 15% this week, the worst performer. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has looked at this week in stock markets. Investors have piled out of European stocks this week, accelerating a decline that began at the end of last month, and has accelerated over the last two days. This morning’s reckless shelling of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant by Russian forces, shows that Putin is becoming increasingly desperate to obtain a victory in the face of numerous setbacks, and with little sign that he is inclined to back down. If anything, the stubbornness of Ukrainian forces is enraging him further, in turn raising the uncertainty level further. These actions are a significant escalation and raise the question as to whether Putin could adopt a scorched earth policy in his attempts to crush Ukrainian resistance. Fears of further escalations, on top of rising inflationary risks putting pressure on European companies’ margins, as well as future profits, and has seen the Dax slide to its lowest levels since December 2020. While Boris Johnson has claimed that Britain has been at the forefront of action against Russia, this is the reality. Sainsbury’s is renaming its chicken kiev to chicken kyiv and pulling a Russian-made vodka from its shelves in the latest action by a British retailer to signal solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The UK’s second-biggest supermarket said the packaging for the poultry dish would change in the next few weeks, switching the Soviet-era name for the country’s capital for the Ukrainian one. The move comes after several smaller operators announced a switch to chicken kyiv, including the Better Naked brand and Essex-based Our Local Butcher. Marks &amp; Spencer, which popularised the dish in the UK after making chicken kiev one of the first ready meals in 1979, has also come under pressure to rename the dish. John Lewis has become the latest retailer to remove Russian-made products from sale. The John Lewis partnership is working with suppliers to review products of Russian origin. It will stop selling Russian-made vodka in Waitrose and Russian-made pizza oven pellets in John Lewis department stores. Prices for natural gas are surging, while crude oil prices have also picked up again. British wholesale gas for immediate delivery has hit a record, up 29% to 490p per therm. Brent crude is trading $4.8 higher at $115.34 a barrel, after rising to $120 earlier following the Russian shelling of a Ukrainian nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe. Russian forces have taken control of it but luckily there is no damage to its six reactors, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. US light crude has surged $5.69 to $113.37 a barrel. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM told Reuters: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that fears over supply will remain front and centre. He said there is a “new sense of urgency” for the west to try and strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Crude oil prices hit their highest level in a decade this week, rising to $120 a barrel for Brent. Prices are set to post their strongest weekly gains since the middle of 2020, with Brent up 17% and the US benchmark 21% higher. On the currency markets, sterling has lost 1% against the dollar to $1,3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments like the dollar and gold. Spot gold is up 1% higher on the day, at $1,954 an ounce. Wall Street has opened lower, as worries over the escalating war in Ukraine outweighed the strong US non-farm payrolls report. The Nasdaq has extended its losses to 1% while the Dow Jones opened almost 140 point lower, or 0.4% and the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.6% at the opening bell. Over here, the sell-off on stock markets continues. The UK’s FTSE 100 has lost 191 points to 7,047, a 2.6% drop, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC have slid more than 3% and Italy’s FTSE MiB has tumbled 5%. James Knightly, chief international economist at ING, echoed those comments: The US labour market continues to tighten with unemployment now firmly below 4%. Given strong hiring intentions, this will keep upward pressure on pay with the Federal Reserve set to respond with higher interest rates despite uncertainty created by Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The stronger than expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February and upward revisions to previous months gains is another sign that the real economy has considerable momentum, with the Omicron wave having had surprisingly little impact. That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now levelling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months. US employers took on 678,000 more workers in February, far more than expected. The latest non-farm payrolls report from the US Labor Department painted a strong picture of the labour market. Economists had pencilled in a rise of 400,000. The increase in jobs in January was revised higher to 481,000 from 467,000 and December was revised to 588,000 from 510,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8%, the lowest since February 2020, from 4% in January. British wholesale gas for April delivery has jumped 30% to a record 455.04p per therm. If gas prices stay at the current high levels, UK energy household bills – which are rising by 54% in April to an average £2,000 per year under the regulator’s price cap – are likely to go up even more at the next review in October. JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sportswear chain, has announced that it has ceased all trading in Russia across its brand websites and wholesale channels. It doesn’t have any stores or employees in either Russia or Ukraine. It is one of a number of companies that have temporarily suspended operations in those countries, including Ikea and the Smirnoff maker Diageo. It’s not just wheat that is going up in price. The price of pork and other food is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. The Co-op became the first supermarket yesterday to stop selling Russian-made vodka, followed by Morrisons. Here is a video showing the Ukrainian nuclear power station under attack earlier today. The operator of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany has not filed for insolvency, the Russian TASS news agency cited the company as saying on Friday. There are reports that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project has filed for insolvency. This comes after the German chancellor Olaf Scholz halted certification of the controversial project a week and a half ago, the day after Vladimir Putin recognised the self-proclaimed separatist republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine and ordered troops into the area. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east. It would have doubled the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and kept 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. As reported earlier, Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, Britain’s deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Here is our full story on the London Stock Exchange suspending the remainder of Russian-linked firms, and a British independent director resigning from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The travel giant Tui has announced that Vladimir Lukin has resigned from its board. Lukin has also terminated his relationship with Russia’s Severgroup, where he acted as special adviser to the chief executive. Lukin is a Russian politician, a former Human Rights Commissioner of Russia and a former president of the Russian Paralympic Committee, and served as the Russian Ambassador to the United States from 1992 to 1994. Severgroup is owned by Alexey Mordashov, a Russian oligarch who quit Tui’s board earlier this week. Mordashov, a metals magnate and one of Russia’s richest men, is the chairman of Severstal, one of Russia’s biggest steel producers. Mordashov is also Tui’s single largest shareholder with a 34% stake, and this stake has been frozen as he is under sanctions from the EU, targeting individuals with close ties to the Russian president Vladimir Putin. European shares are sliding deeper into the red, after Russian shelling at a Ukrainian nuclear plant – Europe’s biggest nuclear power station – led to a fire that burned for several hours, before being extinguished. The reactors are fine, according to the Ukrainian authorities, but this illustrates the dangers to a nuclear plant in a military conflict and has caused deep unease at the International Atomic Energy Agency. Putin’s forces have seized the power station. UK’s FTSE 100 down 109 points, or 1.5%, at 7,129 Germany’s Dax down 273 points or 2%, at 13,423 France’s CAC down 125 points, or 2%, at 6,249 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 606 points, or 2.5%, at 23,357 The Moscow stock exchange has been shut all week. The Russian rouble has weakened 2.35% to 108.70 per dollar, after hitting 116p per dollar, near a record low. This video clip went viral last night: On the commodities markets, Brent crude is trading at $110.84 a barrel, up 0.3%, while US light crude is at $108.44 a barrel. Oil prices are set for their strongest weekly gain since mid-2020. British wholesale natural gas for next-day delivery is nearly 3% higher at 395p per therm, after approaching December’s record high of above 450p earlier this week. The Dutch futures contract has hit record highs in recent days above €185 per megawatt hour and is currently nearly 4% higher at €167. Commodity markets are on track for their biggest weekly gains in years after the shuttering of Ukrainian ports, fighting in several major cities and widening sanctions against Russia led buyers of oil and gas, crops and metals to look for alternatives. Russia and Ukraine together account for just under 30% of global wheat supplies, and Russia is a major exporter of oil, gas, aluminium, nickel and other metals. The Chicago Board of Trade’s most-active wheat futures contract has climbed 40% this week, the biggest weekly gain on record, while corn is 16% ahead and soybeans have added 5%. Analysts at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets said: We are seeing the commodity ‘melt-up continue with no sign of a let-up. This is obviously grim news for people around the world, who are likely to have to pay more for their household energy and food in coming months. Higher oil and prices will translate into higher transport and production costs, pushing up all goods prices. Richard Hunter, head of markets at the investment firm interactive investor, said Risk assets lurched lower once more following reports of an attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine, while commodities continued their rise amid the inflationary impacts of the conflict. Oil spiked to almost $120 per barrel on the news before settling back to around $112 – but still up by 44% in the year to date – as news emerged that an increase in output following a deal between the US and Iran is not close to materialising. Meanwhile, there were further spikes in commodities such as nickel, copper and aluminium as the escalation of sanctions on Russia threatened general supply chains. The current turmoil leaves central banks somewhere between a rock and a hard place. The Federal Reserve , for example, needs to weigh the likely economic damage to growth against the inflationary pressure of commodities. Chairman Powell indicated earlier in the week that an interest rate rise of 0.25% rather than 0.5% was imminent, which was initially of comfort to investors, but has added that it was “too early to say if Russia changes the rate path.” Further confirmation of a recovering US economy is expected later in the form of the monthly non-farm payrolls report, although this lagging indicator does not encompass the current impacts of the tensions. The limited appetite for risk assets is clearly shown by the performance of the major indices. In the year to date, the Dow Jones is now down by 7%, the S&amp;P 500 by 8.5% and the Nasdaq by 13.5%. The FTSE 100 is certainly not immune from the global uncertainty, but the latest round of tensions has sent the index into negative territory for the year. The UK’s premier index had steadfastly been clinging to small gains, propelled by its defensive nature, peppering of inflation-proof stocks, and a large exposure to the oil and mining sectors. However, after another weak opening in early exchanges, the FTSE100 now stands down by 2.7% in the year to date. British deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said that Britain will seize the properties of Russian oligarchs if there is the legal basis to do so. Speaking on LBC Radio, Raab said: If we’ve got the evidence and there is the legal basis, we’ll do it. Asked if he would support using such properties to Ukrainian refugees, he said: Yes, absolutely, we’re looking at everything in the round. Britain has been criticised for being slow to apply sanctions to pro-Putin Russian oligarchs, while Germany and France seized two yachts owned by Russian billionaires in recent days. Here’s a round-up of today’s other main stories so far. Britain’s economic growth will halve this year as a result of soaring inflation, hefty tax rises and the destabilising shock from the war in Ukraine, a leading business lobby group has warned. In the first major forecast of the UK economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it expected an inflation rate of 8% to cut disposable incomes in 2022, putting the brakes on the recovery from the pandemic. The UK has sanctioned two new billionaire allies of Vladimir Putin, amid growing pressure to speed up the crackdown on Russian oligarchs, with delays blamed on legal issues and poor preparation. Amid widespread criticism of the delays to sanctioning more Kremlin allies, the Guardian understands ministers are set to reform “intimidation lawsuits” to crack down on multimillion legal bills from oligarchs. The oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov were added to the UK sanctions list on Thursday night, a week after it was announced there would be a “hitlist” of more than 100 oligarchs. Both will be cut off from their multimillion pound British mansions, with a full asset freeze and travel ban. Sajid Javid has said the NHS in England must stop using energy supplied by the Russian-owned firm Gazprom. European stocks have slid at the open. UK’s FTSE 100 down 46 points, or 0.67%, at 7,191 Germany’s Dax down 1.4% France’s CAC down 1% Italy’s FTSE MiB down 1.35% at 23,632 Spain’s Ibex down 0.3% The LSE’s move to suspend eight more stock listings means that all 36 companies with strong Russian links are now suspended from the London market. It suspended global depositary receipts, which represent shares in a foreign company. It said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. The LSE added state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares have tumbled after a fire burned for several hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, following shelling from Russian forces. It was later put out and Ukrainian authorities said the reactors were safe. The International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. However, the incident underlined the dangers to a nuclear plant in the midst of a conflict. Reuters reported that Russian forces have seized the power station, citing Ukrainian authorities. Major stock indices in Asia fell sharply, with Japan’s Nikkei closing 2.2% lower and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng losing 2.7%. European markets are expected to open lower again, after heavy losses in recent days. The Moscow stock exchange will stay shut for a fifth day. The international benchmark Brent crude jumped above $114 a barrel but later retreated to just under $112 a barrel, up 1.3% on the day. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he was “deeply concerned” about the situation at the nuclear plant. Russia’s week-long invasion of Ukraine has sparked a rally in commodities prices amid fears of supply disruption. Wheat prices hit a fresh 14-year high yesterday, with Chicago futures closing almost 22% higher at $12.89 a bushel. In Asia today, Chinese wheat prices jumped 6% to an all-time high of 3,595 renminbi a metric tonne. Aluminium, which has hit several fresh record peaks this week, is heading for the biggest weekly gain on record, up more than 13% so far, as fears of supply disruption deepened. The metal touched an all-time peak of $3,850 a tonne this morning. Benchmark nickel rose 2.7% and hovered close to a seven-year high of $27,976 a tonne touched on Thursday. Russia is a major producer of both metals, wheat and other commodities. James Rutherford has resigned from the board of Evraz, the London-listed steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The news comes a day after the Institute of Directors urged British directors to stand down from the boards of Russian companies. The London Stock Exchange has suspended the stock listings of several more Russian-based companies, including Sistema and Magnit, after suspending 27 yesterday.

She had been repeatedly arrested since early 2021, on specious charges – “violation of sanitary and epidemiological rules”, social media activity, attending a demonstration in support of the imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny. She is no longer in Iceland, and speaks to me, as her fellow Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova did earlier this year, from an unnamed location. But she resists any phrases that dramatise her situation – persecution, flight, exile, escape – preferring a hard-boiled statement of the facts. “I was arrested, many times – and not just arrests. I was under a travel ban, I had a red flag on the border for two years, I had to find a way to tour. The heads of the political Moscow police were quite often trying to go to my house, speak with my mother, catch me there.” She describes the trigger event for her departure: the news that she was about to be moved from house arrest to a prison. So she hasn’t fled; she has found a way to go on tour, living in a van, raising money any which way, through spoken word, performance art, merchandise, NFTs. “I understand there was a big noise about my so-called escape, but I don’t have any plans for emigration. I just want to help Ukraine and that’s it.” She made €10,000 selling T-shirts and sent the money to a Ukrainian children’s hospital. Alyokhina and her girlfriend, Lucy Shtein, also from Pussy Riot, have made an NFT using the ankle tags from their house arrest, melted and turned into digital art: “They’re our trophies from the fight with the Russian government. We believe those fetters will be gone.” The proceeds from that – whether you understand NFTs or not, they can raise vast amounts of money – will be split between Ukrainian charities and Russian political prisoners. “We cannot balance the nightmare which the Russian army and Vladimir Putin have created. But I believe, as Russians, we can do something good. As a human, and especially as an artist, it’s very important to raise up our solidarity with Ukraine and our call to stop this war.” There is something instructive and depressing about the story of Pussy Riot and the world’s reaction. When they started in 2011, they were a loose collection of female artists, writers, activists and anarchists. Alyokhina was a student at the Institute of Journalism and Creative Writing in Moscow. As well as writing protest songs, the band wore neon balaclavas and taped their mouths closed. Alyokhina’s targets are wide-ranging – the oppression of women, the savage homophobia of the Russian state, the climate crisis, Putin’s kleptocracy – but boil down to one cause: anti-authoritarianism. To the global media, they were just fun, racy rebels. So, when three of them, including Alyokhina, were arrested for hooliganism in 2012 and sentenced to two years in jail, it didn’t leave much of a mark on Putin’s reputation, even though human rights organisations such as Amnesty International designated them political prisoners. The protest was deadly serious: it was against Orthodox Church leaders’ support for Putin and the blind eye they were turning to his corruption and creeping totalitarianism. Yet the substance of that, and the harsh consequences it had, was ignored in the service of everyone playing nice at international summits. Alyokhina rolls her eyes, as if to say that is not the half of it: “We were released on 23 December 2013. A month after our release, we made an action [demonstrated]: ‘Putin will teach you how to love the motherland.’ That was at Sochi, the Olympic Games, and that was the first time we were beaten physically. That was the first moment that I understood: Russia was already worse than when we were imprisoned.” Two weeks later, Putin annexed Crimea – “the first point of no way back”, she says. “Especially shocking was the very weak reaction of the west. There were slight sanctions, but nations continued to deal with Russian businesses. Germany was selling weapons to Putin’s regime, evading the weapon embargo. A lot of capital from oligarchs went to Britain, especially to London. I spoke at the European parliament, in your parliament, in the US Senate. Everyone was ‘deeply concerned’, but nothing happened. In Russian activist circles, there are a lot of jokes about the west being deeply concerned: it means they are not going to do anything.” If there had been the sanctions there are now after Crimea and the subsequent invasion of the Donbas, Alyokhina is certain that we would not be in this mess today. “We were calling for a full embargo in 2014 and again in 2015. We were doing street actions. I was arrested 100 times. I hear a lot of discussion in the west that it’s very hard and painful to stop buying oil and gas – well, you guys had eight years. In eight years, it would have been possible. In one month, it’s hard. Maybe politicians were afraid of their voters protesting that their houses were cold. Now Ukrainians don’t have houses at all.” She lays out in brutal terms what this combination of inertia and self-interest has created. “Money from the west is the basis of our imprisonment, of our poisoning, of political murders and, now, of the war in Ukraine. I really want people to understand this and stop it.” You can trace Putin’s growing sense of impunity through the totalitarian acts he got away with. And it does bear reflection: how did he manage it with so little censure? The marked, even absolute, absence of women in Russian political life has tended to pass without comment, as a historical or cultural quirk. “All this Russian criminal culture, which dates from the Soviet Union, is very misogynistic,” says Alyokhina. “There is no place for women at the decision-making table. No first ladies, no role for women. Even western journalists trying to write about Russian feminism – who do they name? Alexandra Kollontai. She was living in the 1920s.” Feminist anti-war resistance is stifled within Russia and unobserved outside it. “Propaganda is working like in the Third Reich,” Alyokhina says. Most chillingly, the persecution of LGBTQ+ people has moved at speed, from intimidatory arrests – you can be prosecuted for holding a rainbow flag – to the creation of what the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta in 2017 referred to as “concentration camps” for gay men in Chechnya. “Russia was protesting all these years – there were streets, squares, full of people, beaten, arrested, imprisoned for five, six, seven years – and nobody cared because it was within her borders,” says Alyokhina. “It has always been this way.” Even if the west has now woken up, or rather been awakened, have we fully grasped the seriousness of the situation? There is an overwhelming consensus about Putin – that he is a warmonger and tyrant – but still, Alyokhina feels, there remains a reluctance to take his utterances seriously. “He gave interviews 10 years ago and started to talk about his role models. One is Joseph Stalin. The biggest tyrant, who repressed, raped our people, killed our culture, killed all my favourite artists, some of them personally. This is a grave warning. If you listen carefully, you can understand where it will go.” Commentators desperately cling to the hope that Putin is just one wild man, that around him are people who will eventually find the spine to overthrow him. Remarks were made recently by a representative of Rosneft, Russia’s largest state oil company. “You must have heard it,” Alyokhina says, with frustration, but no, I have not. “He promoted Adolf Hitler. He said that, of all the decisions in the west, the Anglo-Saxons are the most guilty people. The first nuclear bomb must be dropped on Great Britain. This is what we have, in our so-called news. They are speaking about nuclear bombs almost every day.” The news that does percolate from inside Russia is that the state propaganda machine is extremely effective on the older generation, who take its news as truth, and that this has created irrevocable social and family rifts. Alyokhina describes one member of her collective whose father called her a Nazi for supporting Ukraine. “There are examples of parents reporting it to the police when their twentysomething children go on demonstrations. This is very Soviet Union, teaching people to call the police or the KGB if there is a political difference of opinion. Now, it’s again rising up.” Alyokhina’s mother, a programmer who raised her alone (she didn’t meet her father until she was 21), isn’t like that at all. “My mum is amazing. She understands that we have a new Hitler in Russia.” The central propaganda line is “to provide the message that everything is complicated” for long enough that the war slips out of the western media “and then they will attack more”. But there is another strand to the state media’s message – that Putin is fighting nazism in Ukraine. This is “very hard for old people, whose parents fought the Nazis. There is almost no family in Russia who didn’t lose their relatives in the second world war. But my mother is very clear, and very sad, about what’s happening.” She is absolutely trenchant on one point, which she returns to often and has said on stage, in interviews, online: Putin must be tried as a war criminal. “Without an international trial for Putin, it is just unfair to pretend that Russia can exist like before. There has to be an international judgment for this. Without the understanding that Putin is a terrorist and a criminal, it will just be more blood. More dead bodies. More raped women.” Alyokhina starts rolling a cigarette, underscoring her nervous intensity. She lights up. The image recalls the smoke-hazed faces of resistance fighters since nazism began. She has never lost faith in resistance movements within Russia, especially from Russian women – “a great power, probably the biggest power in the country”. Totalitarianism – probably all of it, not just Putin’s – thrives on “this concept of women sitting at home, feeding the children and going to church. It’s very dangerous if the women rise up. That’s another revolution.” Nor has she ever wavered in her belief that activism counts. “I really believe that each gesture, each word, each action is important. All these small impacts are the basis for building something different.” International fellowship is powerful, even when it is expressing itself in despair. “Sometimes, there is huge hope. For example, we were performing in Hamburg and there were two Ukrainian artists singing a hymn after us. We stood on the stage, hugging each other. For several seconds, everyone was crying. I was so shocked that this fellow feeling can exist after all this tragedy.” I wonder, then, at the immense sadness of being exiled from your country, yet feeling its acts so keenly as your responsibility; of watching brutality unfold when you have warned of it for a decade and paid for those warnings time and again with your freedom. “I will not talk about my sadness when, even today, there have been two bomb attacks against Ukraine,” she says. “Emotions are not important. We should continue, all of us, because it’s a war.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Philips Hue Go table lamp review: battery-powered smart light for indoors or out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/17/philips-hue-go-table-lamp-review-battery-powered-smart-light-for-indoors-or-out","fields":{"bodyText":"The latest Philips Hue Go smart light aims to be a great indoor table lamp that you can just pick up and head out into the garden with for impromptu illumination wherever you need it. It costs £140 ($160), which makes it fairly expensive for a rechargeable lamp, although in line with fancier designs. It joins the smaller, dish-shaped £80 Hue Go in the company’s portable lineup. What sets the Go table lamp apart is its integration with the rest of the Hue smart light system, behaving like a small regular table lamp until you pick it up from its charging base. It has a minimalist aesthetic, made of metal with a reassuring heft. It has a removable rubber grip on the shaft and is splash-resistant in case it rains. The lamp has a colour-changing LED that shines downwards from the solid shade, providing a nice ambient or accent light. It shines at 370 lumens when turned on, which is the equivalent of a 4W LED or 25W tungsten bulb, but hits 530 lumens (6W LED, 35W tungsten) at its brightest setting. That’s enough to illuminate a small table, making it ideal for alfresco dining. Full controls including brightness and a spectrum of colours are available through the Hue Android or iPhone app. The lamp can be used on its own, controlled via Bluetooth from the phone. But it is best when connected to the Hue Bridge and grouped with other smart lights for various fancy features such as schedules and automations, party modes and voice control via smart speakers. Specifications Dimensions 35 x 14.2cm Weight 973g Water resistance IP54 (splash) Connectivity Hue bridge and Bluetooth Max brightness 530 lumens Battery life 5-48 hours, depending on brightness When used on its little circular power base, the lamp draws electricity straight from the mains, bypassing the battery to avoid it wearing out. Pick the lamp up and it switches to battery power, lasting up to 48 hours at its dimmest setting or about five at its brightest. That’s long enough for most outdoor evenings in the summer, but it isn’t the kind of lamp you’d take on a camping trip. I put it in the middle of the table for a dinner party in winter, synced it to Spotify for some music-linked lighting effects, and used it to light a night of cards, all of which worked very well. The one thing you can’t do is see how long is left on the battery, which seems like an oversight. A full charge of the battery takes about four hours. Sustainability Philips Hue’s parent company, Signify, rates the battery in the lamp for at least 800 full charge cycles, with at least 80% of its original capacity and the bulb for at least 20,000 hours or at least five years of typical use. The battery can be removed, but replacement options are not yet available. When used on the base, the lamp is lit directly from the mains, bypassing the battery and prolonging its life. The company commits to a minimum of five years of software support, but has a track record of much longer. Signify publishes annual sustainability reports. Price The Philips Hue Go portable table lamp costs £139.99 ($159.99) and is available in black or white with different-coloured grips. For comparison, the Philips Hue Go 2 costs £79.99, rechargeable camping lights of a similar brightness start about £40, and rechargeable table lamps typically cost from £80. Verdict The Philips Hue Go portable table lamp is a good example of a dual-use product: one that works equally well indoors and out, potentially replacing two devices with a multi-purpose one. It is a good small indoor table lamp, ideal for mood lighting when used on its base. It is very handy to be able to pick it up and add impromptu light to a table or carry it outdoors for summer evenings. It feels well made, but its minimalist design might not fit with everyone’s decor, and the inability to tell how much charge is left in the battery is irritating. It could do with more onboard controls, too. Its integration with the Hue smart light system and all its trappings is the killer feature, for which privilege you are paying roughly £40 extra. If you’ve ever wanted to take a fancy smart light outdoors, this is it. There isn’t anything else quite like it. But if you are not already a Hue user, it is an expensive colour-changing lamp and far less appealing. Pros Dual-use indoor/outdoor product, multicolour, integration with full Hue smart system, control via Hue app, smart design saves battery when docked, splash-resistant. Cons Expensive, battery life could be longer at brightest settings, can’t check battery life in app, top button can’t dim light or be customised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/oct/20/colorado-latinos-our-vote-is-important-historic-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"In this new congressional district, Latinos hold the power: ‘I tell my kids, vote’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/20/colorado-latinos-our-vote-is-important-historic-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/20/colorado-latinos-our-vote-is-important-historic-vote","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s cold for an early October afternoon at Glad Tidings Assembly of God Church in Greeley, Colorado. Kids in puffy jackets are running around on the front lawn while the pastor and his volunteers grill food for the high schoolers who show up after football practice. “Last Friday we cooked up 240 hamburgers and 176 hot dogs,” Linda Gonzales says proudly. Gonzales grew up in Greeley on the cattle farm her family has lived on for 70 years. The church events provide children in the neighborhood with somewhere to go after school, she explains. But today, the barbecue is also hosting organizers who are telling the parishioners of Glad Tidings about voting, and their voice in the 8 November midterm elections. Greeley is part of CD-8, a new congressional district drawn after the 2020 census to include a slice of Larimer county, the agricultural Weld county that includes Greeley, and Adams county, which includes the northern suburbs of Denver. Weld county has traditionally been run by conservatives and Adams county leans Democrat, making the new district a toss-up. Most analysts and local polls have been predicting it’ll send a Republican to Congress, though by very slim margins. Who wins in CD-8 may all come down to who shows up at the polls, analysts say. And with Latinos making up 38.8% of the district’s residents, the community could play a huge role in deciding the balance of Congress. For organizers from both parties and nonpartisan organizations, that dynamic has presented an opportunity for Latinos to make their priorities heard. It’s part of the message Stacy Suniga and Sonny Subia are sharing with parishioners at Glad Tidings Assembly of God. “Now that we have a new district that is balanced and fair, our work is to re-engage Latinos into the political process, or perhaps invite them if they’ve never been before,” says Suniga, a longtime Greeley resident and president of the Latino Coalition of Weld county, which supports Latinos running for office. Suniga is walking around the barbecue with a clipboard of voter registration forms. Showing up at events like this is part of a strategy to use “trusted voices” to get out the vote. Success has been intermittent. “There’s a lot of fear to participate,” Suniga says. Most of the folks at the church told her they’re registered to vote already, she says, leaving Subia, her colleague, wondering whether they were just looking for a way out of the conversation. Subia is the volunteer Colorado state director for the League of United Latin American Citizens. He is also a school expulsion officer, and a longtime Greeley resident; he reminisces about mentoring one of the parents at a nearby table when he was a kid. Latinos in the area are afraid of sharing information with the government, he says, especially when they feel they need to protect relatives who are undocumented. “It was the same thing with the census,” he notes. He insists more needs to be done to educate voters. “They don’t know that there’s a new congressional district. A lot of these people don’t know where they’re voting.” “We’re behind the eight ball right now,” he concludes. ‘I don’t see a way I can use my voice’ Many Latinos in Weld county work at the JBS meatpacking plant that was the site of a Covid outbreak in 2020, Subia says. They care about family, and providing for their kids. “They take two steps forward and one step back and it’s a struggle … They don’t always realize that the vote is important to how rough the struggle is going to be for them.” Others are simply not allowed to vote. At a bakery on the west side of Greeley, where the line of people getting pastries for their families stretched around the shop on Sunday afternoon, many people shrug when asked about the midterms. Roughly a third of Colorado’s immigrant population is undocumented, barring community members from the polls or making them wary of authorities. It’s a response Javier Luna, a paid canvasser for the Colorado Democratic party over in Thornton, a Denver suburb, frequently encounters as well. On the hour-long drive from Greeley to Thornton, sprawling farms dotted with occasional oil rigs have made way for American suburbia, with the Denver skyline in the hazy distance. Luna has been assigned to knock on the doors of a mobile home community near the party’s campaign office in Thornton. He’s speaking mostly Spanish and is getting lost looking for the addresses among the tightly packed manufactured houses. Oscar Salgado Hernandez is running a garage sale outside his home; he’s a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, with temporary legal status because he was brought to the US as a child. He says he pays attention to immigration policy as a result, but not to elections, since he can’t vote. “I don’t see a way that I can use my voice.” Laura Villalobos also can’t vote, but says she talks to her children about the importance of voting. “I tell my kids, vote for this one, for the one I think is going to help us, as Hispanics.” Other residents tell Luna they’re cynical about the process. Politicians ask for their vote as a Latino, they say, but then don’t prioritize the community’s needs once they’re in office. Luna is a no-nonsense communicator, quickly informing voters about the new district and their chance to elect the Democratic candidate, Yadira Caraveo, a Latina pediatrician and representative in the state legislature. When he can squeeze it in, he adds that her opponent is like “Trump with a different name”. “It’s about delivering the information accurately in a way that gives them a sense of urgency, a sense of importance,” he says. “When we are talking to voters, this might be the only interaction that we have before the election, before they get their ballot.” ‘The power of the Hispanic vote’ Angel Merlos is talking to folks with a sense of urgency as well. Merlos is Colorado’s strategic director for the LIBRE Initiative, a conservative nonprofit that advocates for economic freedom as a way to empower Hispanic Americans. “A lot of people talk about how politicians need to start realizing the power the Hispanic vote has, which I agree with 100%,” Merlos says. But he thinks the onus is also on the community to make themselves heard. “We can do much more. We are not voting like we can.” LIBRE Initiative’s political action committee has endorsed the Republican state senator, Barbara Kirkmeyer. Merlos says the group focuses on Kirkmeyer’s proposals to strengthen the economy when talking to voters, rather than some of her other stances, including her opposition to abortion access. “I’m not saying she’s perfect, I wouldn’t say we would agree with her a hundred percent, even me personally. But I think in general, the issues she talks about – inflation and the economy – are something that really impact our community. And we need to see a fix for that.” A national poll of Latino voters in Colorado conducted in July and August 2022 by UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, found voters’ top priorities were inflation, crime and gun violence, and jobs and the economy. Abortion remains a topic of conversation in the district, however. On the same day as the church gathering, two dozen protesters are holding an anti-abortion rally outside the strip mall where Greeley’s Planned Parenthood clinic is located. A few feet away six people hold “my body, my choice” posters. ‘This could be historic’ In a well-kept suburban neighborhood in southern Greeley, Letty Manzo opens the door to talk to a Democratic canvasser. She knows the midterms are coming up next month, but it’s the first she’s heard of the new district. “I know it’s coming up and coming quickly, but I have other things on my mind,” says Manzo, 37, who works in retail to support her family of six. “I’m trying to support my family, especially with everything going up: health payments, the car payment. I’m focused on putting food on the table for my kids.” She compares rising housing prices with the canvasser, who lives nearby. She takes the pamphlets, and promises to read up on the candidates. She seems interested, and the canvasser marks the encounter as a success. Despite the challenges to get out the vote just weeks before the election, Rhonda Solís, a former member of the local school board who is now running for a new seat on the state board of education, feels encouraged. She recalls not learning until she was an adult that Latinos were such an important part of the historic make-up of Greeley, where she’s canvassing on a Saturday morning. “Growing up here, I was very quiet. I didn’t feel like I was really part of the community.” Through participation in Latino organizations, she came to see elected office as a way to benefit her community. She is one of three Latinas, including Caraveo, who are on the ballot to represent this district at some level. “This could be historic if we all three get elected. And I want to make sure that people in CD-8 understand and know that if they ever felt like their vote didn’t count or like it didn’t matter, it does. And it’s going to be right now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-22T14:16:40Z","webTitle":"‘It’s half of what was shot at us’: Kharkiv’s Russian missile cemetery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","fields":{"bodyText":"During the first few months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the cruise missiles fired by Moscow at its neighbour remained embedded for days at a time in the buildings and streets of the north-eastern province Kharkiv. Then, one by one, officials working for Ukrainian prosecutors recovered, registered and catalogued them, before moving them to a fenced-off area in an industrial district of Kharkiv city that has become known as the “missile cemetery”. More than 1,000 explosives and the debris of rockets are lined up in rows, covering an area half the size of a football field. Ukraine’s army calculates that Russia has fired more than 5,000 cruise missiles, in addition to countless artillery rockets, since the war began. A large number have fallen on Kharkiv. Local authorities say that one day the devices could become part of a museum to remember the atrocities of war. In the meantime, though, they hope the debris can provide information to help bring prosecutions against Russian authorities and soldiers. “This place was created for collecting evidence of war crimes,” said Dmytro Chubenko, the spokesperson for the Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office. “These devices were all found in Kharkiv city. But it is approximately only half of what they shot at us. These are pieces of evidence that we hope will be used in the international criminal court.” About 95% of all the devices stored in the missile cemetery are parts of multiple launch rocket systems, including Smerch systems that can be used to carry cluster bombs, which were banned by most of the world under a 2008 treaty and have been used by Russia in areas of Ukraine where there were neither military personnel nor military infrastructure. By analysing the types of devices fired, their flight paths and the GPS locations of where they landed, prosecutors in Kharkiv have placed dozens of Russian soldiers and officials under investigation, including Col Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov, who also took part in Russia’s 2016 bombing campaign against Syria. According to multiple reports, Zhuravlyov was the only senior Russian officer who could sign off an order to launch a Smerch rocket attack on Kharkiv. Chubenko said the study and analysis of munitions was crucial to investigating responsibility for alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. Munitions are marked with a series of codes denoting the manufacturer, details of refurbishment if applicable, and more rarely the military unit that handled maintenance. “You can see the digits and letters which these missiles are marked with,” Chubenko said. “With the help of those we could identify which plant produced them and sometimes which military unit stored and maintained them.” Neil Corney is a research associate at the Omega Research Foundation, an independent organisation based in the UK dedicated to providing evidence-based information about the manufacture, trade and use of military, security and police technologies. He said identifying the unit that stored missiles and rockets was key to investigating potential war crimes. “Ideally, if you want to link the use of the munition to a crime then you need to show its chain of custody,” said Corney. This chain includes where the munition was stored and maintained, its distribution to a military unit, its use, its location at the site of a potential crime, and the secure storage of its remains. In the Kharkiv missile cemetery, prosecutors have stored some of the missiles that hit residential areas in north Saltivka and Oleksiyivka. They have singled out a Russian general, whose name cannot be disclosed due to an ongoing investigation, who allegedly gave an order to launch at least 100 missiles from Russian-occupied northern Ukraine into the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a hotbed of early nuclear research in the former Soviet Union. Although the facility does not present a radiation threat, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has said that the scale and intensity of attacks on the institute “violates all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars I outlined at the beginning of the conflict”. Chubenko said the consequences of the missile attacks could have been drastic. “Of course the Russians were aware of the nuclear research reactor being located there since it was built in the Soviet times and Rosatom [the Russian state nuclear power company] has got all the blueprints,” he added. Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief prosecutor for Kharkiv, said thousands of potential war crime and other criminal proceedings had been opened against Russian soldiers and officials in his province alone. Authorities estimate that more than 1,700 people have been killed by Russian shelling, including 44 children, in Kharkiv city and its surroundings. Nationwide, the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has recorded 21,965 civilian casualties since the beginning of the Russian invasion, including 8,231 deaths. The OHCHR has noted that the actual casualty figures are much higher due to a delay in receiving information from locations experiencing intense hostilities. Reports are still pending corroboration in places including Mariupol, Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/29/first-thing-more-than-2m-without-power-as-florida-hit-by-hurricane-ian","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T10:13:38Z","webTitle":"More than 2m without power as Florida hit by hurricane Ian | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/29/first-thing-more-than-2m-without-power-as-florida-hit-by-hurricane-ian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/29/first-thing-more-than-2m-without-power-as-florida-hit-by-hurricane-ian","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the US mainland, has battered south-west Florida with high winds, rain and storm surges as it weakened and moved inland. More than 2m homes and businesses were left without power as the storm swept ashore in south-west Florida on Wednesday afternoon, bringing “catastrophic” 150mph winds and a deadly storm surge of up to 18ft. Hours later, the storm – estimated to be about 140 miles wide – was downgraded from a category 4 to a category 1 storm as it moved slowly north-east, causing major flooding. The true scale of the damage remained unclear as darkness fell, with power and communications networks down, and emergency services workers forced to take shelter from the worst of the storm. Residential areas in Fort Myers Beach and several other coastal cities were almost submerged, buildings were damaged, and trees and power lines brought down. The utility company Florida Power and Light warned people in Ian’s path to brace for days without power. What’s the latest? The full extent of damage from Hurricane Ian is likely to remain unknown for some hours, with power and communications disrupted in many areas and some emergency responders forced to wait for the return of daylight and safer conditions before beginning a full search and rescue operation. Millions of Florida residents remain directly in the crosshairs of the storm. Ukraine calls for Russia to be declared ‘terrorist state’ after damning report The head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency has called for sweeping American and European sanctions targeting Moscow after an official report drawn up by an international working group concluded Russia should now be declared a “state sponsor of terrorism”. The call from Andriy Yermak, the second most powerful Ukrainian government official after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, came after Ukraine accused Russia of sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, an accusation that adds to its claim that Russia has shown all the characteristics of a terrorist state under US and international law. Such a designation, resisted so far by the US, would allow for secondary sanctions to be imposed on any entity or individual trading or supporting Russia government bodies, including state-owned banks. It would also allow US nationals and employees to sue Russia for money damages or material compensation for personal injury or death caused by the Russian state’s terrorism. Russians seeking to enter the US would face heightened restrictions. Meanwhile, Sweden’s coastguard earlier this week discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a coastguard spokesperson told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. The EU suspects sabotage was behind the gas leaks on the subsea Russian pipelines to Europe and has promised a “robust” response to any intentional disruption of its energy infrastructure. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 218 of the invasion. Shooting at California school campus injures at least six people At least six people were injured in a shooting at a school campus in Oakland on Wednesday, authorities in the northern California city said. The shooting occurred at Rudsdale Newcomer high school, said Darren Allison, the Oakland assistant police chief. The school teaches students at risk of not graduating who have recently immigrated to the US after fleeing their home countries “because of violence and instability”, according to the school’s website. It is one of four adjacent schools serving middle and high school students on Fontaine Street in east Oakland. “The victims were affiliated with the school and we are determining the affiliation at this time,” Allison said, although he declined to say whether any students or teachers were involved. Paramedics transported six patients to hospitals, all with gunshot wounds, according to a Oakland fire department spokesperson Michael Hunt. Three of the wounded were admitted in critical condition at Highland hospital. The condition of the other three was unknown, officials said. Who are the injured? Their names have not been released but the Oakland mayor, Libby Schaaf, tweeted that all of the wounded people were adults.

Stat of the day: More than 1,700 environmental activists murdered in the past decade – report More than 1,700 murders of environmental activists were recorded over the past decade, an average of one killed nearly every two days, according to a new report. Hitmen, organised crime groups, and their own governments murdered at least 1,733 land and environmental defenders between 2012 and 2021, figures from Global Witness show, with Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico and Honduras the deadliest countries. The killings have disproportionately affected lower-income countries and Indigenous communities.

Last Thing: Tom Hanks thinks he’s only made four ‘pretty good’ movies. Which are they? Tom Hanks has written a novel. To accompany the announcement, Hanks released a brief statement – and it is quite profoundly Hanksy. Not only does Hanks use the statement as proof that he knows his literary beans – at one point he literally quotes Hamlet – but he also pulls off the mother of all aw-shucks America’s Dad moves. “I’ve made a ton of movies (and four of them are pretty good, I think),” he writes, in what is almost definitely a demonstration of his famed everyman understatement.

The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. The UN’s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. Hospital patients are being evacuated from Kherson city because of bombardment by Russian forces, the governor of the region, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. The recently recaptured city in the south of the country faced heavy shelling last night. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said. In a statement following a phone call with President Zelenskiy, she said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European Union governments remained split over at what level to cap Russian oil prices to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has met with a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine for a carefully staged meeting meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. Zelenskiy said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” He also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Seven people were killed and 21 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needs through the winter, during a visit to Ukraine. Cleverly is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine. Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.” The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Half of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, is still without power. Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to take out the country’s power infrastructure. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there would be “no lasting piece” if Russia wins in Ukraine. He said Nato will continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and conservative opposition leaders, aims to serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021.

Cold Enough for Snow by Melbourne writer Jessica Au also won the fiction category at the Victorian premier’s literary awards on Thursday night, bringing her total winnings to $125,000 for a book the Guardian’s critic Imogen Dewey described as “graceful and precise”. The judges praised Au’s novella, which follows the finely nuanced relationship between mother and daughter as they travel through Japan, as “quietly powerful” and a “deftly woven novel from a writer in command of her craft”. The book has already exposed Au to an international audience, having won the inaugural biennial Novel prize in 2020, an international award that guarantees publication in the UK, Ireland, US, Australia and New Zealand. The slim volume was unanimously selected from some 1,500 entries to win the Novel prize, with the New York Times comparing Au’s talent to that of Albert Camus. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Cold Enough for Snow is the second book from Au, who works as an editor and bookseller. Her first book, Cargo, was published 12 years ago. Among the categories of nonfiction, Indigenous writing, poetry and young adult categories, new writers dominate this year’s Victorian premier’s literary awards. Turkish-Australian essayist Eda Gunaydin, a University of Wollongong lecturer, won the nonfiction prize for her debut collection, Root &amp; Branch: Essays on Inheritance. Lystra Rose, a writer of the Guugu Yimithirr, Birri Gubba and Erub nations and Scottish descent, won the Indigenous writing prize for her debut young adult fantasy fiction novel The Upwelling, which weaves the language and practices of the Yugambeh people into the narrative. The young adult prize was won by New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based writer Kate Murray for her debut novel We Who Hunt the Hollow, also a fantasy novel. A collection of poems about family, loss, heartbreak, history and erasure, collectively titled At the Altar of Touch, won Beijing-born Brisbane writer Gavin Yuan Gao the poetry category. The play The Return, by Saibai Island (Torres Strait) dramatist John Harvey, won the drama prize. The work attracted highly positive reviews when it debuted at Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre during last year’s Rising festival. All of the category winners collect $25,000 each. The $15,000 Unpublished Manuscript award was won by Melbourne writer Mick Cummins for One Divine Night which “explores homelessness, social systems and family complexities”, while the $2,000 People’s Choice award went to Karlie Noon and Krystal De Napoli’s Astronomy: Sky Country, which explores the long history of astronomy in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Victoria’s creative industries minister, Steve Dimopoulos said this year’s winners reflect the diversity of literary talent from across the country. “Writers play a vital role in our creative industries and cultural life, telling the stories that shape and reflect who we are,” he said. Caro Llewellyn, the chief executive of the Wheeler Centre, which administers the awards on behalf of the Victorian premier, said the fact that debut works accounted for five of the eight winning works were a sign that “fresh perspectives and compelling new voices are being amplified in the Australian literary community”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T15:47:19Z","webTitle":"Trump: I would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines if still president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"If Donald Trump were still president, he told Fox Business on Monday, he would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines. Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, who is therefore dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s status as a nuclear-armed power has shaped the US response, particularly in Biden’s reluctance to take steps, such as a Nato-implemented no-fly zone over Ukraine, that might lead to direct armed confrontation with Russia. Such caution cuts little ice with Trump. “I listened to him constantly using the N-word, that’s the N-word, and he’s constantly using it: the nuclear word,” Trump told Fox Business on Monday. In US usage, the “N-word” typically refers to a racist epithet for Black people. “We say, ‘Oh, he’s a nuclear power,’” Trump said. “But we’re a greater nuclear power. We have the greatest submarines in the world, the most powerful machines ever built … “You should say, ‘Look, if you mention that word one more time, we’re going to send them over and we’ll be coasting back and forth, up and down your coast. You can’t let this tragedy continue. You can’t let these, these thousands of people die.” Hundreds of thousands of people would die in any nuclear exchange with Russia. Trump has already said Biden should threaten Russia with nuclear attack. He has also said the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia”, and then “say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch”. He has also praised Putin as “smart” and declined invitations to call him “evil”, stoking speculation about relations between the two men and particularly what was agreed when they met in private in Helsinki in 2018. Trump has also condemned Putin’s war in Ukraine as a crime against humanity. Biden has called Putin a war criminal. When Trump was in power, in 2018, he announced that the US would withdraw from a cold war nuclear weapons treaty which kept US and Russian nuclear weapons out of Europe. It duly did so. New Start, an Obama-era nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, remains in place. Analysts have warned that Putin could use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Russian leader has put his nuclear arsenal on high alert. In office, Trump also demonstrated a cavalier attitude to diplomacy regarding North Korea, another nuclear power. Though he courted the dictator in Pyongyang, Trump also told Kim Jong-un he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button and would answer any threats “with fire and fury like the world has never seen”. He also asked the rapper Kid Rock and rocker Ted Nugent what he should do about North Korea. Writing for the Guardian this month, the former US labor secretary Robert Reich said he like many had thought nuclear powers would “never risk war against each other because of the certainty of mutually assured destruction”. “I bought the conventional wisdom that nuclear war was unthinkable,” Reich wrote. “I fear I was wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/mar/01/powerful-evidence-of-online-gambling-harm-federal-parliamentary-inquiry-head-says","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-01T07:27:18Z","webTitle":"‘Powerful evidence’ of online gambling harm, federal parliamentary inquiry head says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/01/powerful-evidence-of-online-gambling-harm-federal-parliamentary-inquiry-head-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/mar/01/powerful-evidence-of-online-gambling-harm-federal-parliamentary-inquiry-head-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Broadcasters, sporting codes and betting companies should expect more restrictions on gambling advertisements and promotions, after the head of parliamentary inquiry cited “powerful evidence” of harmful practices. The inquiry into online gambling harm, led by Labor MP Peta Murphy, has now received almost 150 submissions from organisations involved in sports betting and held multiple hearings. It will inform any regulatory action taken by the federal government, amid concerns the $50bn industry is causing undue harm. “It is absolutely clear that it is not just community members who are concerned about the proliferation of sports betting advertisements and the increasing engagement of young people in sports betting,” Murphy, the chair of standing committee on social policy and legal affairs, said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “We have heard from a lot of public health experts, academics, researchers and support services and the evidence is pointing to harm from gambling being something that exists for online betting as well as the more traditional, land-based gambling that we’re all aware of.” The peak bodies for free-to-air TV and radio broadcasters have argued current advertising restrictions are appropriate and that further regulation could lead to a reduction in free sport coverage, due to a decline in revenue from gambling contracts. The peak body for major sporting groups has issued a similar warning, saying funding to grassroots sport could decline. Those claims were rejected by Murphy, who questioned why broadcasters would not cut other expenses and why sporting codes would not invest in the development of their games. “I have invited those organisation to familiarise themselves with the other evidence that we are receiving from experts and to take into account community views and expectations around advertising,” Murphy said. “The suggestion that the current regime is absolutely perfect is not supported by what we are hearing from community members or experts in the gambling space.” Last year, the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation reported an average of 148 gambling ads were broadcast between 6pm and 8.30pm every weeknight on free-to-air TV. That figure is disputed by Free TV Australia. Complaints to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) almost doubled last financial year, with the regulator warning current restrictions are failing to meet community expectations. This week, the ACT attorney general, Shane Rattenbury, added to growing calls for regulation, telling the inquiry he would support a near complete ban on sports betting advertising. The South Australian government has also called for a ban to be considered while the NSW, Queensland and Tasmanian governments believe the current rules are too weak. Murphy said she was distressed by evidence from one addict on the self-exclusion register, who told the inquiry that he was targeted with promotional material including “matched bet offers” to encourage him back to gambling. “The evidence from people who have a gambling addiction or have experienced harm from gambling and the impact that’s had on them and their families, it has been impossible to listen to them and not be disturbed but also impressed by their courage in coming forward,” Murphy said. “When you hear someone say how that has affected them, as someone who is trying to stop gambling, it’s pretty powerful evidence.” The inquiry will make recommendations to government in coming months and, while Murphy would not pre-empt that process, she said it was clear the committee would look at improving the gambling industry. Murphy also said the current Northern Territory-led self-exclusion scheme was not working, citing recent examples of companies sending promotions to gambling addicts who wanted to be left alone. “Betting companies are obtaining the details of people who have never opened accounts with those companies,” Murphy said. • In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858.

Uniper received a €15bn lifeline from the German state in return for a 30% equity stake in a deal agreed in July. The energy company has been left stranded by the drop in gas deliveries from Russia in the fallout from the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday, it said the huge loss included a €6.5bn hit related to anticipated future gas shortages. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has turned the screw on western Europe by limiting gas supplies, including through the crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline into northern Germany. Uniper, which has seen its share price collapse by 80% this year, also took a €2.7bn charge relating to various activities including a loan to Nord Stream 2, another pipeline project, which was abandoned after the start of the war. Germany and other EU nations have rushed to fill up gas storage facilities before a potential cut in Russian gas supplies this winter. About 50% of Uniper’s profit margin used to come from Russian-generated gas, leaving it exposed when supplies were curbed. Germany has set a target of filling 90% of its gas storage by November, with ministers attempting to avoid blackouts that could affect production in powerhouse industries. Stockpiles are 77% full, two weeks ahead of schedule. Investors are now more pessimistic about the German economy than they have been since the eurozone debt crisis more than a decade ago, according to research body the ZEW Institute. Economists fear runaway energy prices and cuts in Russian gas could tip the country into recession, causing knock-on effects for trading partners including Britain. Klaus Müller, president of Bundesnetzagentur, Germany’s energy regulator, said on Wednesday that refilling gas inventories to 95% full by November would cover less than three months of heating, industrial and power demand if Russia cuts off supplies. Müller said: “We are a little bit faster in terms of filling up storage, but it is not a sign we can relax. It should be understood as a push, instead. Let’s keep it going.” Uniper’s chief executive, Klaus-Dieter Maubach, said: “Uniper has for months been playing a crucial role in stabilising Germany’s gas supply – at the cost of billions in losses resulting from the sharp drop in gas deliveries from Russia.” Uniper owns the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station as well as a string of UK gas plants. A representative of the company attended the high-profile meeting between energy executives and Boris Johnson last week, the government looking for solutions to the cost of living crisis. Allegra Dawes, analyst for industrials, materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge, said: “On a positive note, Uniper should be more financially stable due to the cost-absorption mechanism and that it is now allowed to pass through costs to customers through the renegotiation of its current long-term contracts. “The German government will use all its means to stop Uniper from touching its gas reserves to ensure energy security and prepare for the winter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/04/till-review-a-powerful-portrait-of-courage-in-the-face-of-barbaric-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Till review – a powerful portrait of courage in the face of barbaric racism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/04/till-review-a-powerful-portrait-of-courage-in-the-face-of-barbaric-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/04/till-review-a-powerful-portrait-of-courage-in-the-face-of-barbaric-racism","fields":{"bodyText":"A sick feeling of dread propels Chinonye Chukwu’s powerful movie: dread at the racist violence about to happen, dread at the racist violence that is then threatened against those standing up against it. This film is about Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, whose testimony at the subsequent murder trial was disputed. (The closing credits icily remind us that this woman is still alive.) It is also about the boy’s mother Mamie Till, and her courageous campaign for justice, which began with a laceratingly painful decision to have an open casket at her son’s funeral to show everyone the shocking truth. Danielle Deadwyler plays Mamie Till, a calm, determined professional woman and single parent; Whoopi Goldberg has a cameo as her mother, Alma. Jalyn Hall plays Emmett as a smart, extrovert kid with an irrepressible puppyish enthusiasm: cheeky, but no more cheeky than many other teenagers, and mostly just naive. He is sent from his home town of Chicago to stay with family in Mississippi for the summer, with a stern warning from his mother to be careful around white people. Some of the film’s purest nausea resides in the trial itself, with the swaggeringly open racism of the court officials and police. Quite clearly, the fact that any trial was possible at all was down to Mamie Till and the NAACP who took up her cause; it was virtually a private prosecution, the terrible burden for this being placed entirely on Mamie Till herself. Chukwu contrives a stunning coup for the scene in which she arrives at the courthouse, surrounded by NAACP officials and is about to make a quiet, dignified statement to reporters, whose attitude is not obviously different from the jeering crowd behind them; what happens next is best not revealed here, but it is a heartstopping lurch of ironised fear, a bathos of horror. Till is a fierce portrait of courage and a sombre study of the human cost involved in resisting this kind of barbarity. • Till is released on 6 January in cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2023/may/05/fake-books-charles-dickens-got-there-first","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T16:25:14Z","webTitle":"Fake books?

Russia’s president summoned the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and military chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, to a public meeting on Sunday and ordered them to “transfer the deterrence forces” – a reference to nuclear weapons – “of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty”. Do Putin’s words have any specific military meaning? Although the diplomatic threat was clear enough, the exact phrasing confused nuclear experts and defence ministries, who did not recognise what a “special mode of combat duty” might specifically entail. But there was agreement that the threat, though it had gone up a notch, remained at a low level. Pavel Podvig, widely considered a leading expert on Russian nuclear forces, tweeted that that Putin’s order “most likely” meant “the nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command”. This would turn the system on, in effect, allowing “a launch order” to “go through if issued”. It would also allow, he wrote, for the nuclear weapons to be launched “if the president is taken out or can not be reached”, but he added, only in the case “it detects actual nuclear detonations on the Russian territory”. David Cullen, of the Nuclear Information Service, said this was, in a way, “analogous to the British system”, where the commanders of Trident nuclear submarines are given letters of last resort, signed by the prime minister, of instructions on how to act if it is believed that the UK has been destroyed by an all-out nuclear attack. Both Podvig and other experts, such as James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment, said Putin’s order could also entail further operational changes. That could include sending further nuclear armed submarines to sea or dispersing long range nuclear missiles around Russian territory, from where they could theoretically be used. But that may not necessarily be the case, Podvig added, given Putin’s phrasing was deliberately ambiguous. What is the thinking of western governments? Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, said the UK did not recognise the terms Putin used. “That is not a term that is in their doctrine,” the minister told the BBC on Monday morning. The move was, he said, designed to scare the west and “remind the world he’s got a deterrent” and that it was a distraction designed to ensure that the west was “talking about it rather than the lack of success they are having in Ukraine”. The defence secretary also warned Russia could, in theory, use so-called tactical nuclear weapons in the fight against Ukraine. But this would amount to a massive – and still unlikely – escalation against what Putin has described as “one people” with Russians. “They could be every bit as powerful as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs; most people say there is no such thing as a non-strategic nuclear weapon,” said Sebastian Brixey-Williams, a co-director of the Basic thinktank. Has Russia said anything more since Sunday to explain itself? There was a signal, from the Kremlin itself, on Monday that its statement was primarily a form of high stakes diplomacy. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the decision came in response to various western warnings there could be “collisions and clashes between Nato and Russia”. He added: “I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister.” Matthew Harries, a nuclear specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said the statements were a warning of a different sort. It was, in the first instance, simple intimidation – “we can hurt you, and fighting us is dangerous” – and a reminder to the west, which is increasingly arming the Ukrainians, not to go too far. “It could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a ‘keep out’ warning to the west,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/24/european-countries-pledge-huge-expansion-of-north-sea-wind-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T14:48:41Z","webTitle":"European countries pledge huge expansion of North Sea wind farms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/24/european-countries-pledge-huge-expansion-of-north-sea-wind-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/24/european-countries-pledge-huge-expansion-of-north-sea-wind-farms","fields":{"bodyText":"Nine European countries have pledged to multiply the capacity of offshore wind farms in the North Sea by eight times current levels before 2050, turning it into what Belgium’s energy minister called “Europe’s biggest green power plant”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the plan with the prime ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg. Norway’s prime minister and Britain’s energy security minister, Grant Shapps, also committed at the summit in Ostend, Belgium, on Monday to build more wind farms, develop “energy islands” – connected renewable generation sites at sea – and work on carbon capture projects. “We are unlocking our offshore energy ambitions,” the Belgian energy minister, Tinne van der Straeten, said. “Coordination is absolutely essential. If each of the nine countries acts alone, we’ll collectively fail. Planning is at the core of everything.” Aiming to both curb reliance on Russian gas and radically reduce the use of CO2-emitting fossil fuels, the nine countries aim to boost their combined North Sea offshore wind capacity to 120GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050. All the leaders recognised the scale of the task, which will require massive investment. Macron also said it was also important that the infrastructure was produced in Europe and the jobs created were European jobs. “We don’t want to repeat the errors we’ve committed in the past, deploying equipment made on the other side of the world,” he said. Scholz described the summit as “very important” and Von der Leyen said the North Sea would soon be “the powerhouse of Europe”. Several leaders also stressed the need to protect Europe’s offshore wind farms and their interconnectors from sabotage and espionage following reports of Russian spy ships in the North Sea and last year’s sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. The capacity targets represent a further doubling of goals announced at a similar four-country summit in Esbjerg, Denmark, in May 2022, three months after European energy markets were plunged into turmoil by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander de Croo, said developments since then meant energy was “more than ever a geopolitical topic” and the countries would standardise infrastructure to ensure North Sea wind farms could be built faster and cheaper. The Netherlands and Britain announced plans for Europe’s biggest cross-border electricity link connected to an offshore wind farm, while the EU and Norway pledged to develop infrastructure to capture and store CO2 from depleted North Sea gas fields. Britain has 45 offshore wind farms producing 14GW, with plans to expand capacity to 50GW by 2030. Germany has 30 producing 8GW, followed by the Netherlands with 2.8GW and Denmark and Belgium, both with 2.3GW. France aims to expand massively to 40GW by 2050, an official said. They added: “Offshore wind energy will probably be the main source of renewable energy production between 2030 and 2050, far ahead of solar energy and land wind farms.” The investment required to ensure the North Sea wind energy targets are met is huge – the EU recently calculated €800bn would be needed to reach 300GW by 2050 – and wind energy companies have said significant state funding will be essential. Industry association WindEurope said Europe should be building the offshore infrastructure to add 20GW in output a year, but is creating capacity for only 7GW annually because of supply problems with key turbine parts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-363-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T14:25:06Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 363 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-363-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-363-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Russian Preisdent Vladimir Putin has given a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine, announced Russia would suspend the New Start nuclear treaty with the US, and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin claimed the Ukrainian people had become “hostages of their western masters” who occupied the country in political, economic and military terms. He said “the regime is not serving their national interest. They are serving the interests of foreign powers”. He claimed the west is trying to turn a local conflict into a global conflict and “we will react in an appropriate way. We are talking about the existence of our country.” Referring to the sham referendums held late last year, Putin praised the citizens of occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, saying “You yourself determined your future. You made your choice despite the threats of terror of the Nazis. Next to you there were military actions taking place, and you made the choice to be together with Russia. To be together with your motherland.” Putin said the west had begun “not just a military, but an economic aggression” against Russia. “They have not achieved success in either of these areas,” he said, boasting that Russia’s economy had restructured and that “the initiators of the sanctions are punishing themselves.” Ukrainian responses to the speech were scathing. “He is in a completely different reality, where there is no opportunity to conduct a dialogue about justice and international law,” political adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Another adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, said “The insolent thief said that Russian farmers harvested a “record harvest” last year. And he shyly kept silent about the fact that it was stolen Ukrainian grain, which was transported to the Russian Federation by freight trains”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Austria called Putin a liar. Russian state media websites broadcasting Putin’s address suffered an outage during his speech. The state-run RIA Novosti news agency said the outage was the result of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday Russia’s decision to suspend participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty made the world a more dangerous place, and he urged Moscow to reconsider. The impact of Russia’s statement that it is suspending nuclear arms control talks is unclear and the US nuclear posture remains unchanged, state department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday. Russians forces shelled civilian areas of the southern city of Kherson, killing six people and injuring 12 more, at the same time that the Russian president was speaking. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy over what it called Washington’s increasingly “aggressive course”, accusing it of widening its involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Joe Biden had visited Kyiv on Monday to announce a new package of additional US aid to Ukraine worth $500m (£415m) including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems, and air surveillance radars. The timing of his visit – before Putin’s address – was seen as a deliberate rebuke of the Russian president. The US president then arrived in Warsaw late on Monday evening where he is set to meet with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, along with other leaders of countries on Nato’s eastern flank. The US president will make a speech later today outside Warsaw’s royal castle. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he and Biden spoke about “long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine, even though it wasn’t supplied before”. But no new commitments were detailed. There have been at least 18,955 civilian casualties since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR released the report citing the number of casualties as being 7,199 killed and 11,756 injured, but believes the actual figures are considerably higher. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said on Tuesday that the country’s defence minister and chief of general staff were depriving his fighters of munitions, accusing them of trying to destroy Wagner. “There is simply direct opposition going on,” Prigozhin said in a voice message posted on his Telegram channel. He said it was “an attempt to destroy Wagner” and equated it to treason. Eighteen Russian MPs are expected to attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Friday, the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has already said it will boycott the winter session of the OSCE’s parliamentary assembly at the organisation’s headquarters on 23 and 24 February, saying Russia would use the event to “justify its aggression” and “whitewash war crimes”. Belarus said on Tuesday that there was a significant grouping of Ukrainian troops massed near its border and warned that this posed a threat to its security. “At present, a significant grouping of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the Belarusian-Ukrainian section of the state border,” the defence ministry said in a post on Telegram. “The probability of armed provocations, which can escalate into border incidents, has been high for a long time,” it said, adding that it would take “measures to adequately respond.” Japan is to provide $5.5 billion in financial aid to Ukraine, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said, ahead of a G7 video conference on Friday that will include the Ukrainian president. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is in Kyiv to meet with Zelenskiy, and reiterate Italy’s support for the war-torn country. Tuesday’s trip is seen as one of the most significant made by Meloni since she came to power in October and comes a week after her coalition partner Silvio Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader, blamed Zelenskiy for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. EU foreign ministers on Monday discussed jointly procuring ammunition to provide to Ukraine during a meeting in Brussels. “It is the most urgent issue. If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger,” the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said before the meeting. Borrell said the EU needs to ensure that Ukraine has enough ammunition to continue its fight against the Russian invasion, regarding the advance payments scheme as a vital medium-term solution, but wants ammunition delivered from national stocks now. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Moscow with proposals for a political settlement to the war. Over the weekend, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned against Beijing providing material support to Moscow’s invasion, prompting China to tell the US to keep out of its relationship with Russia. “We would like a political solution to provide a peaceful and sustainable framework to Europe,” Wang Yi said ahead of his visit during a stop in Hungary. Former UK prime minister’s Boris Johnson and Liz Truss urged Rishi Sunak to send fighter jets to Ukraine during a debate on Monday in the House of Commons. Truss said she “could not wait to see fighter jets over Ukraine” while Johnson urged the government to “cut to the chase” and “give them the planes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jun/05/trump-criticis-doj-rule-of-law-second-term","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T10:00:36Z","webTitle":"Trump critics warn of ‘deep decline of rule of law’ if he wins second term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/05/trump-criticis-doj-rule-of-law-second-term","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/05/trump-criticis-doj-rule-of-law-second-term","fields":{"bodyText":"As Donald Trump begins another campaign for the presidency, his extremist rhetoric and lies about the 2020 election signal that in a second term, Trump would attempt to thwart the rule of law at the justice department and other agencies in an effort to expand his power and attack critics. Former DoJ officials, some Republicans and academics say that if Trump becomes the Republican nominee and is elected again in 2024, he would most likely appoint officials who would reflexively do his bidding, target dissenters he deems part of the “deep state” and mount zealous drives to rein in independent agencies. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general during the George HW Bush administration, told the Guardian: “Of all the many reasons Donald Trump’s candidacy should be rejected out of hand, none is more important than his utter disdain for the rule of law – the idea that we are a society governed by rules and not by the will of one person.” Ayer said: “It’s hard to imagine what would become of our legal system if Trump became president again. “In his first term, aided by attorney general William Barr, who made a pretense of believing in even-handed justice, Trump was still able to grossly misuse the Department of Justice as a political campaign tool, to do favors for his friends, and to seriously undermine the separation of powers. “There would be no arguable adults in the room in a second Trump DoJ. Beyond pardons for the January 6 criminals and politically motivated prosecutions, one can expect a broader pattern of abuses aimed at securing his autocratic power.” Trump has given plenty of hints about what he would do in a second term, many of which suggest he would become more extreme than during his previous four years in office. In the wake of his loss to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump falsely claimed the election was rigged and, with help from key allies, he tried to overturn the results in several states Biden won. Separately, after leaving office Trump retained classified documents. These Trump moves have sparked federal and state criminal investigations, which could result in charges against him and others in coming months. Trump has vehemently denied any wrongdoing in all these matters. At campaign stops in Texas, New Hampshire and elsewhere, Trump has demonized critics, including the prosecutors leading these criminal inquiries, and spoken of the inquiries in conspiratorial terms. During a March rally in Waco, Texas, Trump lashed out at the “thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system” before denouncing prosecutors and investigators. Ominously, he warned the crowd: “When they go after me, they’re going after you.” He said: “Together, we are taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents our people have ever seen, some of them from within.” As part of his dark Waco messaging, Trump added: “Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state.” One of the targets of Trump’s ire has been the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who charged him earlier this year with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments he allegedly made to the porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2016. Similarly, at the CNN town hall in New Hampshire in early May, Trump doubled down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He also seemed to glorify the mob of loyalists who attacked the Capitol on 6 January 2021, which led to the deaths of nine police officers and others. In an appeal to his base, Trump said that if he gets re-elected, he will be “inclined” to pardon “many” of the protesters involved in the insurrection during Joe Biden’s certification by Congress. He even called January 6 “a beautiful day”. Given these comments on the campaign trail and his past performance in office, Trump’s critics say a second term would mean few, if any, checks on Trump’s impulsive behavior, and that he would surround himself with pliant allies. “Donald Trump has no regard for our institutions,” the ex-DoJ inspector general Michael Bromwich told the Guardian. “There is no better proof of this general truth than his attitude towards the Department of Justice. He believes it should be the political tool of the White House, which should target his enemies and go easy on his friends.” Bromwich noted that Trump’s choices of Barr and Jeff Sessions as attorneys general ultimately disappointed him, “because there came a point for both of them that they couldn’t go as far as Trump needed”. “If Trump were re-elected, we can look forward to a swift and deep decline in the rule of law,” Bromwich said. “Top levels of the DoJ would be staffed with election deniers; there would be a wholesale exodus of talented career personnel from every division of DoJ; and large numbers of January 6 insurrectionists would be pardoned. After four more years, the Department of Justice as we know it would be in tatters.” Bromwich stressed too that “Trump doesn’t believe in any type of oversight, whether conducted by Congress or inspectors general”, and that voters “should expect total resistance to any congressional oversight and the firing of IGs who dared to do their jobs of ferreting out waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct”. Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard and the co-author of How Democracies Die, said Trump was an even more extreme candidate now than he was in his previous campaign. “It’s pretty clear that Trump will come in as a more dangerous figure than in 2016. He had no inclination then to respect the rule of law. He saw the state as subordinate to his own will, much like a tinpot dictator. He came in as an authoritarian figure but with no plan,” Levitsky said. “Trump filled his government mostly with conservatives who cared about not breaking the law. They provided some resistance. Civil servants and people he appointed put the brakes on his wildest instincts. Now, he’s angrier and bent on revenge. Trump’s got people he wants to go after, as well as the so-called deep state. He’s going to be much more careful in the people who he appoints. Trump has a much more authoritarian plan.” The prospect of a more authoritarian President Trump is one that scares other critics who say his conduct in his first term was, at least in part, checked by conservative figures such as his ex-chief of staff John Kelly, and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Notably, both have voiced their opposition to Trump since they left their posts. Kelly told the Washington Post that Trump’s pardon pledges for the January 6 rioters were not surprising: “All those people who tried to overturn the election, that’s exactly what he wanted them to do. He can’t be turning his back on the people who tried to save him in the election,” he said. Trump has displayed other troubling signs, including allying himself with some of the most extremist Republican figures. One such person is Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who tried to help Trump reverse his loss to Biden. In late May, Trump used his media platform Truth Social to attack the GOP-controlled Texas House for impeaching Paxton over bribery and other alleged misconduct. The ex-president labeled Paxton’s impeachment the work of “radical left Democrats” and “Rinos” [Republicans in name only]. In another radical Truth Social post shared in late May, Trump pledged that on his first day in office he would issue an executive order to overturn birthright US citizenship – a right guaranteed in the 14th amendment. Former GOP House member Charlie Dent told the Guardian he believed that “Trump would engage in more conduct through” executive orders upon re-election, and would “use his powers to do executive actions and ignore congressional powers and prerogatives”. Dent predicted that in a second term, “Trump would load up his administration with sycophants, unlike in the first term”, adding that the kinds of conservatives who Trump tapped before, such as the defense secretary James Mattis and Kelly, “will be gone”. “Trump will surround himself with people who would be disinclined to offer any restraints on his worst impulses,” he said. The conservative lawyer George Conway also issued dire warnings about a second Trump presidency. “He’s going to manipulate the levers of government to help himself personally and to go after his enemies,” Conway said. “He’s going to turn our government into a third world government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/29/gas-fired-plants-uk-lights-on-cost-profits-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T14:00:51Z","webTitle":"The gas-fired plants tasked with keeping UK lights on – but at what cost?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/29/gas-fired-plants-uk-lights-on-cost-profits-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/29/gas-fired-plants-uk-lights-on-cost-profits-energy-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"At the entrance to the old munitions factory, a pair of ornamental lions stand guard, each with a stone paw resting on a cannonball. The Coryton complex in Essex dates back to 1895, and its use has changed over the years. Behind the lions loom the grey girders of a gas-fired power plant capable of generating electricity for up to 800,000 homes – and substantial profits for its owner. Debate is raging over the role of gas-fired electricity in the energy crisis. Coryton is one of a fleet of UK peaking plants, so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times, a backstop when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform. But they also attract some of the highest rates per megawatt hour (MWh) of any power source, and those rates have jumped with the gas price since the invasion of Ukraine,leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Another source of controversy is that unlike oil and gas extraction, peaking plant income is not subject to the government’s windfall tax. The design of Britain’s energy market is under scrutiny as never before, as efforts to decarbonise collide with a need to keep the lights on during the Russian-inflicted gas shortage. Ofgem will soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Supporters argue they are an essential rapid source of electricity supplies, and cannot be relied upon to produce reliable profits; detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. Last month National Grid paid a record £27m on a single day to get power stations to crank up supply at short notice, including £6,000 a MWh to fire up Rye House power station in Hertfordshire. Rye House belongs to VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol. Like many other peaking plants, it has passed into the hands of overseas investors as some of the biggest UK operators have exited the market. Coryton was owned by InterGen until last week. It now belongs to the Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group, which bought it from another Czech businessman and China Huaneng and Guangdong Energy. Yet another Czech billionaire, Daniel Křetínský, owns EP UK Investments, which has a power plant collection that includes South Humber Bank and Langage – formerly owned by Centrica. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, Křetínský has varied UK interests, including stakes in Sainsbury’s and Royal Mail. Prices paid for gas-powered electricity this winter are unprecedented. The average offer price for “balancing actions” – to align supply and demand – between the start of September and early January was £287 a MWh. Data from Elexon, which oversees the market, shows Rye House submitted the 20 highest winter bids – between £5,000 and £6,000 a MWh – for varying volumes of power on 12 December, setting new records. That day, VPI earned more than £11m, while InterGen received an estimated £12.6m from Coryton, according to figures from the market data platform EnAppSys. InterGen said a rise in demand had produced a “particularly pronounced spike” on 12 December, and that it always acted “in line with regulations and guidance issued to the market, to provide energy to balance the grid and keep the lights on across the UK”. Among the other plants bidding above-average winter prices were Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired plant in Nottinghamshire and its gas power station Killingholme in north Lincolnshire, as well as Dinorwig, a pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales that is majority-owned by the French multinational Engie and is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Cowes power station on the Isle of Wight and the Didcot plant in Oxfordshire both bid at £1,500 for small volumes in October. Controversially, none of these profits have been subject to the windfall tax introduced by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor and expanded under Jeremy Hunt. Companies House records showed VPI Holding’s pre-tax profits surged from £44m in 2020 to £204m in 2021, on turnover that more than doubled to £2.1bn. Reuters reported in September that Vitol made more profit in the first half of 2022 than in the whole of 2021 – close to $4.5bn (£3.6bn), compared with a net record of just over $4.2bn in the 12 months before. The ‘electricity penalty shootout’ The country’s electricity supply industry is a complex jigsaw puzzle designed to encourage the generation of everything from wind, solar and nuclear power to biomass and gas-fired. Underpinning this is the “balancing market”, operated in effect by National Grid, which relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Last winter, the network operator tripled its spend on balancing the grid to £1.5bn. The system is designed to prioritise renewable electricity ahead of nuclear, coal and gas. The electricity price in every half-hour period is set by the marginal cost of the last generating unit to be turned off to meet demand – usually gas-fired plants, which have the highest costs. While gas prices were low, there were few objections to this system, but the energy crisis has triggered repeated calls for gas and electricity pricing to be delinked. The supplier Good Energy draws the analogy with a penalty shootout in football: the best players (renewables) are selected first “but it’s the individual who steps up last who has the final say, deciding the fate of the result” – in this case, the cost. Gas-fired power still plays a significant role in Britain’s electricity makeup, accounting for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power and well ahead of a record 25.6% for wind. If peaking plants are used regularly, their role could be seen more as “baseload” than backup power. There are concerns about the tactics used by some generators. The energy regulator Ofgem said in November that last winter some generators had declared their plants unavailable to the grid, before later offering power at much higher prices. In 2020, Ofgem required InterGen to pay £37m after concluding that it “sent misleading signals to National Grid in 2016 about how much energy it would supply during peak winter hours to make a substantial profit”. The regulator found InterGen made £12.8m through “manipulation of the market”. At the time, the company said: “We deeply regret and sincerely apologise for the behaviour of former traders.” VPI said any suggestion it had made excessive profits was “not accurate” and that it operated “within the rules of the energy market”. It said peaking plants operated “less frequently, with costs to generate and pricing dependent on market conditions”. A spokesperson added: “VPI has invested to almost triple its generation capacity in the last two years and revenue has grown as a result.” Left out from the levy When Hunt extended the windfall tax last year from oil and gas producers to the excess profits from nuclear, solar and wind, he exempted gas peaking plants, warning of “unintended impacts” amid fears European gas supplies could fall short of demand, leading to blackouts. ScottishPower’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, condemned the decision. “The crisis has been made by gas and paid for by renewables,” he said, adding that it was “strange” for government to “cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave gas generation untouched”. But Tom Glover, the UK country chair of RWE, which owns several gas-fired stations, said they could go for many years without making enough profit. “It’s important that when prices improve and allow them to make higher returns they are able to keep that profit so that they are incentivised to keep these power stations open during lower priced periods.

Under existing laws – which were controversial when introduced by the former Coalition government – the Australian Signals Directorate has the ability to “step in” as a “last resort” in some emergency situations, but only for critical infrastructure assets. A discussion paper released by the government on Monday proposes expanding the definition of critical assets to include customer data and “systems”. That option would “ensure the powers afforded to government … extend to major data breaches such as those experienced by Medibank and Optus, not just operational disruptions”. But the Coalition and the Greens – which together hold more than half of the seats in the Senate – have expressed reservations about changes that could dramatically expand the reach of the “step in” powers. The shadow minister for cybersecurity, James Paterson, said the critical infrastructure laws and emergency step-in powers “were never intended to guard against data breaches but even more catastrophic attacks on our most systemically important businesses like telco companies and energy suppliers”. “It would be a significant departure from the philosophy of those laws and the government would need to make the case it was justified and that ASD had the resources required for what would be a major task,” he said. The Greens senator David Shoebridge, who is responsible for the party’s policy on digital rights, said the government had “not made a case to justify the expansion of these extraordinary takeover powers”. Shoebridge said the existing laws were designed for critical infrastructure “and can’t simply be copy-pasted to solve another problem”. He said the nation could not “keep relying on reactive measures and god-like takeover powers”. “Any powers must be strictly limited in scope and subject to close scrutiny and review, including full transparency in the way the powers are used to ensure people’s personal data is safe.” While the Labor government has not yet drafted a bill outlining specific changes, it has opened a public debate by declaring it is “having a big look” at cyber laws. The minister for home affairs and cybersecurity, Clare O’Neil, said the existing laws envisaged that in “limited circumstances it will sometimes be necessary for government to come in and assist an Australian company or organisation to help manage a cybersecurity incident”. “The problem today is that those powers are very, very narrowly defined,” O’Neil told reporters in Sydney. “The question Australians need to ask is when we look to 2030 and understand the growing, relentless, huge nature of the threat that we confront, do we want to equip government to be better able to support businesses and organisations when they are under that really serious cyber risk?” O’Neil said the government was also considering making it illegal to pay ransoms to hackers in a bid to “reduce the fruits of ransomware for cyber criminals” and signal that “we are not a soft target”. The discussion paper, written by the government’s expert advisory board, said the Optus and Medibank incidents had exposed “gaps” in Australia’s existing incident response functions. “It is clear that a package of regulatory reform is necessary,” wrote the former Telstra boss Andrew Penn, the former air force chief Mel Hupfeld and the cybersecurity expert Rachael Falk. Another option they suggested was a new cybersecurity act “drawing together cyber-specific legislative obligations and standards across industry and government”. The paper said business owners “often do not feel their cyber security obligations are clear or easy to follow” and clearer standards would “increase our national cyber resilience and keep Australians and their data safe”. Penn told the ABC’s 7.30 program the definition of critical infrastructure should remain under review because “the amount of things we’re doing online today has increased dramatically and that will only continue to increase in the future”. “The more we do things online, the more they do potentially become vulnerable to malicious cyber activity,” Penn said. Earlier, Anthony Albanese told a cybersecurity roundtable event that his government was concerned about increasingly prevalent “state-sponsored attacks” and other criminal acts seeking a profit, such as ransomware. “Clearly as it stands, government policies and regulations, business sector systems and measures and our general awareness and capacity as a nation are simply not at the level that we need them to be,” the prime minister said. “This is an ever-evolving threat and it will need adaptation from us and from business and government to make sure that we keep on top of this.” The government also announced it would appoint a new coordinator for cybersecurity, supported by a national office for cybersecurity within the Department of Home Affairs, “to ensure a centrally coordinated approach”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T17:55:45Z","webTitle":"Russian forces in Bakhmut pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, claims Ukraine military commander – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain","fields":{"bodyText":"As the time is approaching 9pm in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, here is a roundup of today’s news. A Ukrainian military commander has said that Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, after counteroffensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers.” Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in a border area between Russia and Ukraine had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters. It comes as Ukraine’s military said its forces have seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, made up of thousands of troops. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut but Moscow was increasingly forced to use regular army units because of heavy losses among the Wagner private army group. The Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner group is fighting in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the brigade had abandoned its positions. Russia has not commented. Prigozhin has complained that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry – which has promised to ensure all combat units have the resources they need – had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters. The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Wagner group terrorists. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. Britain is also set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organisation to increase pressure on Russia, the Times reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported, citing a government source. Russian forces are planning to “evacuate” more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a “catastrophic lack” of personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company claimed on Wednesday. Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory. However, Ukraine has said that Russia is now blocking the exit of the thousands it had organised to leave Enerhodar. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been criticised again for his links to Russia after attending a Victory Day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Schröder was seen at the reception on Tuesday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the far-left Linke party. Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe that it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The decree formally appoints the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to represent Putin during parliamentary proceedings on denouncing the treaty, which aimed to regulate the number of forces deployed by Warsaw Pact and Nato countries. Russia announced in 2015 that it was completely halting its participation in the treaty, having already suspended cooperation in 2007. Russia argues that the treaty, which was intended to balance conventional forces towards the end of the cold war, was de facto in breach because former Soviet republics such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Warsaw Pact nations such as Bulgaria, had become members of Nato by the early 2000s. The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region, but failed. Tass reports that the Russian Federation security service, the FSB, has claimed to have prevented an assassination attempt on a police chief in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, has spoken in Brussels at a meeting of Nato’s military committee. He said the alliance needs to “redouble our efforts” in order to provide security to the 1 billion people in Nato countries, citing what he claimed was a range of rising threats. More news on the killing of Arman Soldin on Tuesday. French judges have launched a war crimes investigation into the journalist’s death in Ukraine, anti-terror prosecutors said Wednesday. Soldin, 32, died when he and his Agence France-Presse colleagues came under fire by Grad rockets on Tuesday while they were with Ukrainian troops near Chasiv Yar, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The French inquiry will be handled by the OCLCH, an investigating unit specialising in crimes against humanity and hate crimes, and will seek to determine the exact circumstances of Soldin’s death, the prosecutors said, according to AFP. Soldin’s death brings to at least 11 the number of journalists, fixers or drivers for media teams killed since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, according to advocacy groups. Russian shelling has killed a woman in Kherson oblast’s Kakhovskyi district on the Dnipro river, the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office reported on Wednesday. Russian forces reportedly shelled the district at about 5pm. The attack also damaged residential buildings and farms in the area. An investigation is under way and the prosecutor general’s office said that a war crimes inquiry had been launched. The UN’s special rapporteur on torture has called on Russia to provide jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny with “urgent and comprehensive” medical care following reports that his health is deteriorating. Navalny’s supporters have said he was suffering from significant stomach pain in jail, which they said could be a sign of some sort of slow-acting poison. “I am distressed by the deteriorating state of Navalny’s health and the apparent lack of satisfactory diagnosis and medical treatment,” Alice Edwards said in a statement. Russia’s penitentiary service has previously denied allegations that its employees have mistreated Navalny and has said he has always been granted medical treatment when needed. Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated for what western laboratory tests showed was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia in 2020. “He must immediately and continuously be provided with adequate care, including comprehensive medical check-ups, treatment and monitoring of his health situation in a civil hospital,” Edwards said. Navalny, 46, is serving combined sentences of 11 and a half years for fraud and contempt of court on charges he says were trumped up to silence him. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder is in trouble again for his links to Russia after attending a victory day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Schröder, who has previously been criticised for his links to Russia, was seen at the reception on Tuesday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the far-left Linke party. The two parties have been critical of the sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The former Social Democrat chancellor is seen at the event in a photo published by the German daily Bild. Schroeder has not yet commented on his presence at the reception. Schröder, who held a number of positions in Russian energy companies, has seen many of the privileges normally given to ex-chancellors taken away for his ties to the Kremlin. Schröder no longer has a publicly funded private office, but members of current chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats have so far failed to expel his predecessor from the party. “I find it incomprehensible,” senior Social Democrat MP Katja Mast said in response to Schröder’s attendance. “Gerhard Schröder’s behaviour can hardly be surpassed in its tastelessness,” said senior conservative (CDU) politician Thorsten Frei. “On the day the former chancellor was entertained by Russian diplomats, innocent people in Ukraine died as a result of the Russian war of aggression,” Frei said. Scholz’s spokesperson declined to comment on the reception at a regular press conference Wednesday. Also seen at the embassy party was the former East German leader Egon Krenz. A Ukrainian military commander has said that Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, after counteroffensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. It comes as Ukrainian forces claim to have routed a brigade of thousands of Russian troops in Bakhmut. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers. ”It was the competent conduct of the defensive operation that exhausted the trained forces of the ‘Wagner’ PvC and forced them to be replaced in certain directions by less well-prepared units of the Russian regular troops, which were defeated and left.” Tributes have been paid to an Agence France-Presse journalist who has been killed in Ukraine. Arman Soldin was killed when an AFP team came under fire by Grad rockets while they were with a group of Ukrainian soldiers near Bakhmut, the epicentre of the fighting for months. His death brings to at least 11 the number of journalists, fixers or drivers for media teams killed since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, according to advocacy groups. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, paid tribute to Soldin’s “courage” and described his work as “essential” to understanding the facts around the war in Ukraine. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “Arman was a talented and courageous journalist and his death is obviously devastating for those who knew him.” “Journalism continues to shine a light in the darkness of this war, and Arman’s work was vital to that. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk region where Bakhmut lies and which has been partially controlled by Kremlin-backed forces for years, offered his condolences to Soldin’s friends and family. “I thank everyone who – risking their own lives – continues to tell the truth about our war,” he said. Some more on the claims earlier that the Ukrainian army has partially destroyed a Russian brigade that has been fighting in Bakhmut. Moscow has not commented on the reports that its 72nd separate motor rifle brigade had abandoned its positions on the south-western outskirts of Bakhmut. Russia’s ministry of defence did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Reuters said it was unable to independently confirm the situation on the ground. A Russian brigade is typically formed of several thousand troops. The eastern Ukrainian city has been the primary target of Moscow’s huge winter offensive and scene of the bloodiest ground combat in Europe since the second world war. Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has repeatedly accused Moscow’s regular armed forces of failing to adequately support his private army leading the fight in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the Russian brigade had abandoned its positions. “Our army is fleeing. The 72nd Brigade pissed away three square km this morning, where I had lost around 500 men,” Prigozhin said. In a statement overnight, Ukraine’s Third Separate Assault Brigade said: “It’s official. Prigozhin’s report about the flight of Russia’s 72nd Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade from near Bakhmut and the ‘500 corpses’ of Russians left behind is true.” “The Third Assault Brigade is grateful for the publicity about our success at the front.” Early on Wednesday the Ukrainian unit, which was formed last year from the nationalist Azov battalion, reposted a video of one of Azov’s founders, Andriy Biletsky, who said his forces had “defeated” the Russian brigade. “In fact, the 6th and 7th squadrons of this brigade were almost entirely destroyed, brigade intelligence was destroyed, a large number of fighting vehicles were destroyed a considerable number of prisoners were taken,” he said. Canada and Latvia will become the latest countries to help train Ukrainian troops. They will jointly lead Ukrainian soldiers on Latvian soil from 15 May, the Canadian defence minister, Anita Anand, said on Wednesday. The training programme will complement other Canadian efforts to train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK and in Poland, said Anand, speaking to reporters alongside her Latvian counterpart, Ināra Mūrniece, in Ottawa. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree calling up military reservists for training in 2023, according to a document published on Wednesday on a government website. The training of these Russian citizens, who are in the armed forces reserve, is a planned annual event. Reservists were partially mobilised in September last year, as the Kremlin looked to bolster its forces in the midst of a swift counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin complained on Wednesday that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry to underpin what he claimed was their advance in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry – which has promised to ensure that all combat units have the resources they need – had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but that there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters. “We’re scraping by with a minimal quantity of shells,” he said, adding his mercenaries were nonetheless continuing to advance in Bakhmut. Prigozhin said the Russian leadership had asked the defence ministry to check the status of Wagner’s shell request, but that bureaucracy meant the process was a slow one. Late last week Prigozhin posted a video of an expletive-laden tirade addressed at senior Russian army officials while standing in what appeared to be a field of Russian corpses. He accused officials of “getting fat” in their offices while his troops died. He subsequently threatened in public to withdraw Wagner forces from Bakhmut, a Ukrainian city Russia has spent ten months trying to take. Germany will buy an additional 50 Puma fighting vehicles worth €1.5bn (£1.3bn/$1.65bn) for its armed forces, two participants in the parliamentary budget committee which approved the purchase on Wednesday have told Reuters. Berlin has ramped up defence spending after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, both sending weapons to Kyiv and replenishing its own military stocks. Ukraine’s military has said its forces have seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, and that the eastern city remained Moscow’s main target. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut but that Moscow was increasingly forced to use regular army units because of heavy losses among the Wagner private army group. The Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose private Wagner group is fighting in Bakhmut, said on Tuesday that the brigade had abandoned its positions. “Unfortunately they have not destroyed the whole [Russian] brigade yet, two companies have been seriously damaged there,” Cherevatyi said in televised comments. “The situation [in Bakhmut] remains difficult because for the enemy, despite all the white noise Prigozhin is trying to create, it [Bakhmut] is the main direction of attack, the main coveted target.” France has asked China to make clear to Russia that Moscow is in an “impasse” in its war with Ukraine, as Beijing seeks to mediate in the conflict. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, told a cabinet meeting that Beijing should urge Russia to “return to peace”, according to a post-cabinet press briefing Reuters has reported. “It is necessary for China to use its relations with Russia to make Russia understand better that it is at an impasse, and to tell Russia to come back to its senses,” she said. The request comes after French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited China last month and sparked controversy by saying that Europe should not be a “follower” of either Washington or Beijing or get caught up in any escalation over the future of Taiwan. The remarks sparked much comment, including from the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, who called them “unfortunate”, adding: “We have never been in danger of becoming or being a vassal of the United States.” The Ukrainian army has claimed that Russia is stopping workers and their relatives from leaving Zaporizhzhia, despite organising their evacuation from the area near the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant. On Wednesday Ukraine’s state-owned energy company, Energoatom, said it had been told that about 3,100 people were to be withdrawn from the southern city from Enerhodar, including 2,700 who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. Warnings have frequently been issued over how dangerous the situation at the power plant has been since the invasion last year. However the situation looks murkier than first thought. In its daily update on Wednesday morning, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said: In Enerhodar, the Russian occupiers organised a so-called “evacuation” for family members of Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant] employees. Yet the employees of the power plant are not allowed to leave the city. The so-called “authorities” put in office by the occupation forces announced the evacuation to recreation centres and hotels of Berdiansk and Kyrylivka. However, those who agreed were taken to Rostov oblast [in Russia] and placed in tent camps. Two Ukrainian civilians were killed and five were wounded in Russian attacks on Tuesday. The preliminary figures come from the country’s military media centre. Russian forces used shells in attacks on 126 settlements across Ukraine, it said. In a statement on Telegram, it said: “According to the information provided by the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russian troops shelled nine regions of Ukraine in the past day. “In total, 126 settlements were shelled with various types of weapons (mortars, tanks, artillery, MLRS, air defense systems, UAVs and tactical aircraft) and 153 infrastructure facilities were hit. According to preliminary reports, two people were killed and five were wounded,” the report said. Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in an border area between Russia and Ukraine had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters. “Yes, indeed, early this morning there was an attempt to commit a terrorist act against the Druzhba oil pipeline system at the Bryansk filling station,” Transneft’s spokesman told Tass. “As a result, no one was hurt. The competent authorities are investigating the circumstances of the incident.” Early on Wednesday, Baza, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s law enforcement agencies, reported that three empty oil reservoirs at the Druzhba pipeline’s filling station came under attack. It said there were no leaks following the attacks. Russian oil supplies via the Soviet-built pipeline have not been sanctioned, however, European countries are scaling back usage of the route amid wider sanctions against Moscow. The Druzhba pipeline was attacked several times after the start of what Kremlin casts as a special military operation in Ukraine last February. The Kremlin has declined to comment on the progress of talks aimed at extending the Black Sea grain deal, which facilitates the export of grain from Ukrainian ports. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement when it ends on 18 May unless what it calls obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports are lifted. Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian Tass news agency suggested that an agreement was close (see 9.46am). Ukraine has sought a longer term extension, and suggested that it would like to see additional ports included in the deal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia’s position was well known and that work on the deal was under way. Two Russian soldiers from Kamchatka in the far east of Russia have been jailed for two and a half years in prison for refusing to fight in Ukraine, human rights group OVD-Info said on Wednesday. In separate rulings, the men, identified in military court documents as Alexander Stepanov and Andrei Mikhailov, were found guilty of refusing orders to go into combat during wartime, Reuters reports. Russian president Vladimir Putin amended the criminal code last year to include prison sentences of up to three years for refusing to fight. Putin ordered the mobilisation of an extra 300,000 troops last September to bolster Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, where the army has sustained heavy losses in nearly 15 months of war. The move, unprecedented since the second world war, prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being called up. The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Russian mercenary group Wagner as terrorists, as the UK reportedly prepares to do the same. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. Britain is also set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organization to increase pressure on Russia, the Times of London newspaper reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported citing a government source.

Ukraine’s Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company. “The Russian occupiers are proving their inability to ensure the operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as there is now a catastrophic lack of qualified personnel,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging service. “Even those Ukrainian workers who, having signed shameful contracts, … are going to be ‘evacuated’ soon. And this will exacerbate the already extremely urgent issue of having a sufficient number of personnel to ensure the safety of operation of the NPP (nuclear power plant) even in the current shutdown state.” Last week, the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said the situation around the Russian-held nuclear station had become “potentially dangerous” after Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas. Russia’s Tass state news agency said on Monday the Moscow-installed governor of the Russia-controlled part of the surrounding region had suspended operations at the plant. Reuters said it was not able to independently verify the reports, and Russia did not immediately comment. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe, and has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused the other side of endangering nuclear safety by firing at the plant. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory. Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe that it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.

Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carry a report from a source in Ankara hinting that the Black Sea grain initiative may be closer to an extension. Moscow has insisted the deal expires on 18 May, claiming that western sanctions in areas such as banking and insurance are preventing it exporting its own agricultural products. Ukraine has sought a longer term extension, and suggested that it would like to see additional ports included in the deal. Tass quotes its source saying: There is information that the deal will eventually be extended after May 18. That’s why I’m talking about it as a fact. And there are expectations that the export of Russian products will be included in it. For President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the extension of the deal is a signal to the west that Turkey can be trusted. Therefore, the authorities will do everything possible to continue the grain initiative The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region, but failed. “As a result of intervention measures, one of them veered off course and went down, while the second was destroyed by gunfire,” Reuters reports governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram. Voronezh is to the east of Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, which both border Ukraine, and it shares a border with Luhansk, one of the occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Tass reports that the Russian Federation security service, the FSB, has claimed to have prevented an assassination attempt on a police chief in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. It reports the FSB said in a statement: The FSB … prevented an attempt on the life of one of the leaders of the law enforcement agencies of the Zaporizhzhia region. The first victim of the attacker was to be the head of the police department in the village of Kirillovka [which is on the Sea of Azov coast, south of Melitopol]. When trying to detain the criminal, he offered armed resistance, but thanks to the professional actions of the special forces of the FSB of Russia, he was disarmed. Tass reports that “components for the manufacture of an improvised explosive device were found at the detainee’s place of residence” and that the man was “a citizen of Ukraine, aged 31, who arrived in the Zaporizhzhia region to carry out sabotage and terrorist activities. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this round-up of the latest developments overnight. It writes on its official Telegram channel: In Bakhmut, fighters of the 3rd brigade of the armed forces of Ukraine advanced 2.6km during the storming of Russian positions for two days and defeated two companies of the 72nd brigade of the Russian Federation, said the commander of the “Azov” regiment. Air defence forces destroyed three Russian drones over Dnipropetrovsk region on the night of 10 May. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Kherson heavily. More than 350 projectiles were fired in Kherson oblast during the day: one person was injured. In Zaporizhzhia, the Russian army shelled 19 settlements yesterday: a resident of the village of Mykilske was seriously injured. The claims have not been independently verified. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, has been speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato’s military committee. He has said the alliance needs to “redouble our efforts” in order to provide security to the 1 billion people in Nato countries, citing what he claimed was a range of rising threats. He told military leaders: The transformation of our alliance over the last decade has been nothing short of remarkable. Since Russia illegally annexed Crimea and entered into eastern Ukraine in 2014, we have increased the readiness of our forces. We have deployed combat troops to the east of the alliance for the first time in our history, and European allies and Canada have spent an additional $350bn extra on defence. When President Putin launched his full fledge invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we were therefore ready. Within hours, we activated all our defence plans. We put 40,000 troops under Nato command, backed by significant air and maritime power, and we strengthened our forward defences from the Baltic to the Black Sea. These actions reduce the risk of miscalculation and escalation beyond Ukraine, by making crystal clear that we will defend every inch of Nato territory. Stoltenberg went on to say: As we prepare for a more dangerous future, we must redouble our efforts to keep our one billion citizens safe, and to uphold the rules-based international order. High intensity warfare is back in Europe, global competition is rising, authoritarian regimes are challenging our values, interests and security, and other threats are also multiplying – from terrorism to cyber-attacks, from nuclear proliferation to climate change. So we need to step up for this new era of strategic competition. Nato’s military committee is meeting in Brussels, and the session has just opened. We will bring you any key lines that emerge. One session is dedicated specifically to discussing Russia and Ukraine. Finland is participating in person as a member for the first times. Adm Rob Bauer, chair of the Nato military committee, has said in his opening remarks that Russia is in the fifteenth month of its planned three day war, and that the committee will be hearing directly from Ukrainian military voices. Here is a little more detail from the Times of London in its report that the UK government may be planning to designate the Wagner mercenary group as a terrorist organisation, following the lead of Estonia, France and Lithuania. The paper writes: [Wagner founder Yevgeny] Prigozhin, 61, was able to use British courts to bring a libel case against Eliot Higgins, a British journalist, after revelations by his website Bellingcat about the group’s shadowy operations. The case collapsed in March last year after the outbreak of war in Ukraine and personal sanctions imposed on Prigozhin, but government sources said it was an example of how proscription could help to prevent Wagner’s influence and operations in the UK. There has not been evidence that Wagner or individuals linked to it are operating in the UK since the war in Ukraine started and proscription is largely seen as a symbolic move. However, a government source said there had been “suspicions” that the group had helped launder money out of the UK along with organised crime groups after financial sanctions were imposed against Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in the wake of the war. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily intelligence update, saying yesterday’s Victory Day parades in Russia, “highlighted the materiel and strategic communications challenges the military is facing 15 months into the war in Ukraine”. The full update reads: On 09 May 2023, the make-up of Russia’s annual Victory Day Parade in Red Square highlighted the materiel and strategic communications challenges the military is facing 15 months into the war in Ukraine. Over 8,000 personnel reportedly took part in the parade, but the majority were auxiliary, paramilitary forces, and cadets from military training establishments. The only personnel from deployable formations of regular forces were contingents of Railway Troops and military police. A vintage T-34 from a ceremonial unit was the sole tank on parade. Despite heavy losses in Ukraine, Russia could have fielded more armoured vehicles. The authorities likely refrained from doing so because they want to avoid domestic criticism about prioritising parades over combat operations. Being listed as a terrorist organisation means EU members could freeze assets of the Wagner group and its members, with European companies and citizens barred from dealing with the group. Prigozhin had his assets in the European Union frozen in 2020 and was placed on a visa blacklist over the deployment of Wagner fighters to war-torn Libya, a decision he unsuccessfully appealed. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, conceded to lawmakers on Tuesday that legally the EU terrorist label would not have any “direct supplemental effect” on the group. But “we should not underestimate the symbolic importance of such a designation, nor the dissuasive effect that it could have on states tempted to turn” to Wagner. In the UK, the blacklisting would make it a criminal offence to belong to Wagner, attend its meetings, encourage support for it, or carry its logo in public, the Times said. It would impose financial sanctions on the group and there would be implications for Wagner’s ability to raise money if any funds went through British financial institutions. On Tuesday, the Times newspaper reported that after two months of building a legal case, Britain would also formally list Wagner as a terrorist organisation to increase pressure on Russia. Citing a government source, the Times said the blacklisting was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks. Britain’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters reports that Russia’s air defence forces shot down an “enemy” drone in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, its governor said on Wednesday, adding that falling debris damaged a gas pipeline and a house. “Debris fell in the village of Tolmachevo. No one was hurt,” the regional governor, Roman Starovoyt, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia and on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. However, Kyiv has recently said that undermining Russia’s logistics is part of preparation for a planned counteroffensive The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Russian mercenary group Wagner as terrorists, as the UK reportedly prepares to do the same. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. “Wherever they work, Wagner members spread instability and violence,” MP Benjamin Haddad told parliament on Tuesday. “They kill and torture. They massacre and pillage. They intimidate and manipulate with almost total impunity.” He said they were not simple mercenaries driven by an “appetite for money” but they “follow a broad strategy, from Mali to Ukraine, of supporting the aggressive policies of President [Vladimir] Putin’s regime towards our democracies”. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: the French parliament has unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. And Russia’s air defence forces shot down an “enemy” drone in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, its governor said on Wednesday, adding that falling debris damaged a gas pipeline and a house. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner force said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions. Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so. Arman Soldin, a 32-year-old video journalist for Agence France Presse in Ukraine, was killed by Grad rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, in eastern Ukraine, AFP said on Twitter, citing AFP colleagues who witnessed the incident. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war, as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue. Ukraine said its air defences shot down 23 of 25 missiles, fired overnight by Russia, chiefly at Kyiv, and there were no reported casualties. It was the second night in a row of major Russian airstrikes and fifth so far this month. Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hailed Ukraine as “the beating heart of today’s European values”. Zelenskiy discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with Von der Leyen in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine. Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/04/volodymyr-zelenskiy-calls-for-war-crimes-tribunal-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-04T13:19:08Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy strengthens calls for a new war crimes tribunal to try Putin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/volodymyr-zelenskiy-calls-for-war-crimes-tribunal-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/04/volodymyr-zelenskiy-calls-for-war-crimes-tribunal-vladimir-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin must face justice for his invasion of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said during a visit to The Hague, as he strengthened calls for a new war crimes tribunal to try the Russian leader. The Ukrainian president said: “We all want to see a different Vladimir here in The Hague, the one who deserves to be sanctioned for his criminal actions here, in the capital of international law. The aggressor must feel the full power of justice. This is our historical responsibility.” In a speech on Thursday, Zelenskiy said only one institution was capable of responding “to the original crime, the crime of aggression” and that was a tribunal. “Not some compromise that will allow politicians to say that the case is allegedly done, but a true, really true, full-fledged tribunal.” The international criminal court, which Zelenskiy visited during his trip, has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and other senior Russian officials over the abduction of Ukrainian children. But it does not have the power to try crimes of aggression, because Russia has not ratified the ICC treaty. Zelenskiy, backed by several EU countries and the European Commission, has called for a special tribunal to try Russian political and military leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine. Creating a special tribunal is fraught with political difficulties and it remains unclear how it would be created. The ICC was negotiated through the UN, but is now an independent judicial body. Supporters of a special tribunal already know that Russia, a permanent member of the UN security council, will block any move to create a new court. The commission hopes to eventually win the backing of the UN general assembly to establish the tribunal. However, some scholars doubt that such backing would be an adequate legal basis to create a tribunal to try the crime of aggression. During his visit to the Netherlands, Zelenskiy also met Vera Bergkamp, the speaker of the Dutch House of Representatives, and Jan Anthonie Bruijn, the Senate president. The Ukrainian leader praised the Netherlands as “one of our key allies in protecting the values of freedom”, according to a transcript on the presidential website. Zelenskiy voiced “special gratitude” to the Dutch parliament for supporting Ukraine’s candidate status for EU membership and stressed the importance of starting accession talks by the end of the year, according to the transcript. The Netherlands was initially sceptical about Ukraine’s quest to become an EU member state, launched just days after the Russian invasion. But once France, Germany and Italy swung behind candidate status for Ukraine last summer, Mark Rutte’s government quickly fell in behind the idea. The European Commission is due to inform the EU’s 27 member states in October on Ukraine’s progress in carrying out reforms, including the fight against corruption. A positive report could pave the way for opening membership talks, although their duration and final outcome remain uncertain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/18/first-thing-west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T10:19:18Z","webTitle":"West prepares for Putin to use ‘whatever tools he’s got left’ in Ukraine | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/first-thing-west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/first-thing-west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Western leaders are preparing for Vladimir Putin to use “whatever tools he has got left” including nuclear threats and cyber-attacks in response to an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russia. British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces could soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting yesterday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. What needs to happen to end the war? A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said yesterday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support. The group said “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. Police charge white man for shooting Black teen boy who had wrong address A white homeowner in Kansas City, Missouri, has been charged with armed assault after he shot a Black teenager who rang his doorbell by mistake, authorities announced yesterday. Andrew Lester, 85, also faces a charge of armed criminal action after shooting Ralph Yarl, 16, twice on Thursday. The teenager, a high school junior, was going to pick up his younger twin brothers from a play date when he went to the wrong address. Zachary Thompson, the prosecuting attorney, announced the charges late on Monday after intense local protests and widespread outrage over the police’s decision to briefly detain Lester before releasing him without charges. Lester was not in custody early yesterday evening, but there was a warrant out for his arrest, Thompson said. Charging documents said that Lester came to the door when the doorbell rang and then shot the boy in the head, before shooting him again, and that no words were exchanged before he opened fire. Yarl was recovering at home after being released from a Kansas City hospital on Sunday, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to his head and chest, his family said. Lee Merritt, an attorney for the family, told the Guardian that Yarl suffered a fractured skull, a traumatic brain injury involving swelling, post-concussive syndrome and injuries to his arm. Why wasn’t he charged sooner? Kansas City police said they could not take further action until they spoke to the seriously injured boy. What have Yarl’s lawyer’s said? The prominent civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump is also representing the family, and earlier told CNN: “It is inescapable not to observe the racial dynamics here … We can only imagine if the roles were reversed, and you have a Black man shooting a 16-year-old white child who was simply ringing his doorbell, and the police took him in for questioning and let him come home and sleep in his bed at night.” ‘It avoids a public grilling’ – why Murdoch could settle Dominion’s Fox News lawsuit Rupert Murdoch’s push to try to bury a landmark defamation case against Fox News aims to avoid further damage to his media empire’s reputation – and protect the 92-year-old from a gruelling court appearance as he formulates succession plans, writes Mark Sweney. Judge Eric M Davis moved on Sunday to delay the start of the $1.6bn defamation trial between Fox Corporation and Dominion, which has alleged Fox News repeatedly broadcast false claims that its voting machines were rigged, amid reports of a settlement. However, the following day Davis confirmed the six-week trial would begin a day later than planned, with jury selection starting on Tuesday, after talks between the parties failed – for now at least. Nevertheless, a settlement deal could yet be brokered at any time, with a possible price tag mooted at about $500m less of a thorny issue than Dominion’s demand for a public apology from Fox. “Any settlement will be very generous but the [Murdoch] empire can take and absorb such a shock; it has paid out more than $1bn over the last decade relating to phone hacking,” says Claire Enders, a co-founder of Enders Analysis and a longtime Murdoch watcher. What else did Enders say? “Murdoch is someone who settles, quickly, efficiently and is extremely pragmatic in his settlements. Shareholders would find it a relief [but] it also spares a desire to put Mr Murdoch and others on the stand, de-risking any potential embarrassment from a public grilling.” In other news … Ron DeSantis has annouunced the latest act of retaliation against Disney for speaking out against his “don’t say gay” law: he’s threatening to build a state prison next to the company’s central Florida theme park. The governor dropped the suggestion at a hastily convened press conference yesterday. The FBI has arrested two men accused of running a covert station for China’s police force in New York and using it as a base to track Chinese dissidents living in the US. The station, in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was allegedly set up in February 2022 and operated by Beijing’s ministry of public security (MPS). A US diplomatic convoy came under fire in Sudan in an apparent attack by fighters associated with Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in an incident he described as “reckless” and “irresponsible”. A woman looking for a friend’s house in upstate New York was shot dead after the car she was riding in was met with gunfire in the driveway, authorities have said. Kaylin Gillis, 20, was travelling through the rural town of Hebron with three people. Don’t miss this: ‘A gamechanger’ – this simple device could help fight the war on abortion rights in the US Dr Joan Fleischman has always had people flying in from across the world to her private abortion practice in Manhattan. Often they are from Texas, sometimes Ohio, or Florida. Some with links to the city, others with none. There’s a reason people fly to see Fleischman, writes Poppy Noor. She provides abortions through manual uterine aspiration – using a small, handheld device to remove pregnancy tissue. The device is gentle enough that the tissue often comes out almost completely intact. It is also a quick and discreet procedure where a patient can be in and out of the door in less than an hour. Fleischman is the co-founder of the MYA Network of primary care clinics and clinicians in 16 states. They believe the tool could be radical in the hands of more primary care clinicians. … or this: Photographer admits prize-winning image was AI-generated A photographer is refusing a prestigious award after admitting to being a “cheeky monkey” and generating the prize-winning image using artificial intelligence. The German artist Boris Eldagsen revealed on his website that he was not accepting the prize for the creative open category, which he won at last week’s Sony world photography awards. The winning photograph depicted two women from different generations in black and white. Eldagsen said he had “applied as a cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions would be prepared for AI images to enter. “They are not,” he added. “We, the photo world, need an open discussion,” said Eldagsen. “A discussion about what we want to consider photography and what not. Is the umbrella of photography large enough to invite AI images to enter – or would this be a mistake?” Climate check: Colorado River snaking through Grand Canyon is most endangered US waterway – report A 277-mile stretch of the Colorado River that snakes through the iconic Grand Canyon is the US’s most endangered waterway, a report has found. The unique ecosystem and cultural heritage of the Grand Canyon is on the brink of collapse as a result of prolonged drought, rising temperatures and outdated river management, according to American Rivers, the conservation group that compiles the annual endangered list. Its future hangs in the balance as the Biden administration is poised to impose changes to the way the Colorado River’s dwindling water is divided. Further restrictions to the flow risks turning the Grand Canyon into an ecological sacrifice zone, causing irreparable damage to wildlife, fish stocks and sacred sites, the report warns. Last Thing: The disgusting food of TikTok – is it designed to eat, provoke or arouse? I have just ironed my husband a toasted sandwich like some kind of tradwife and to be honest, I’m disappointed with his reaction. Unless you are a particularly online person, you are probably asking why, at this point. It’s a question I have asked myself repeatedly, in a rising pitch of incredulity and distress as I dived deep into TikTok food – or FoodTok, if you will. Because that is where the ironed toastie comes from: it’s part of a new generation of TikTok recipe hacks that embody a provocative, frankly deranged “why not?” philosophy. You can watch people boil up crisps to make mashed potato or unholy tacos made by boiling beef, eggs and cheese in a bag of Doritos. At the risk of sounding like Grampa Simpson yelling at clouds – which is exactly how I feel exploring FoodTok – what is going on?

Final results gave the coalition control of both houses of parliament with 44% of the vote and confirmed a swing in the balance of power in the Italian far right towards Meloni as her party made spectacular gains in the League’s northern strongholds of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia. Meloni is expected to be given a mandate from the president, Sergio Mattarella, to form a government after 13 October, meaning she could take office by the end of next month. Brothers of Italy, a party with neo-fascist origins, scored 26% of the vote, while the League took 9%, an abysmal result for a party that in 2019 was polling at almost 40%. The third member of the coalition is Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. The outcome nonetheless makes Salvini, who enacted tough anti-migrant measures during his stint as interior minister in 2018-19, a key protagonist in a government that will be hostile towards immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and women seeking to access safe abortions. “There is a lot to be worried about, as for Meloni to respond to her electorate she will maintain her promises on things that will hit the weakest communities hard, such as immigrants,” said Paolo Branchesi, an activist for Refugees Welcome. Early in the election campaign, Meloni called for the navy to turn migrants back to Africa, while Salvini, eager to return to the interior ministry, said last week that he “can’t wait” to resume a policy of blocking migrant rescue ships from entering Italian ports. “They will bring many difficulties for migrants – in the phase of their migration and the conditions they find upon arrival in Italy,” Branchesi said. The League and Brothers of Italy blocked a law in parliament last year that would have criminalised homophobia, arguing that it would have eroded freedom of speech. Meloni and Salvini have repeatedly made it clear that they are against gay adoption and surrogacy. “We are facing an extreme right that is really worrying, especially if you look at their closeness with Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, Poland and Russia,” said Mario Colamarino, the president of the Mario Mieli Circle of Homosexual Culture. “We need to be better, more vigilant and unite against this nationalism and to protect civil rights. Meloni is not a phenomenon built in a day but a dark cloud that has been hovering over us these last 10 years, and now she’s in power.” Given that Meloni, 45, is calling the shots in the coalition, one of the biggest threats to the stability of her government could come from Salvini, a political chameleon who will not only have to renounce his desire to become prime minister but could be stopped from returning to the interior ministry. “He is arrogant, and you never know if what he says today he will repeat tomorrow,” said Sofia Ventura, a politics professor at the University of Bologna. “It will be a difficult relationship, but they need to stay in power, and so maybe their negotiations will be contained.” Luisa Rizzitelli, a spokesperson for Rebel Network, a women’s group, said she was more angry with the leftwing alliance led by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) over its lacklustre campaign and failure to come up with a strong enough opposition to the right. The PD leader, Enrico Letta, said on Monday that he would step down at the party’s next congress, which he said would be held soon. “It’s shocking for me that we’ve once again managed to vote for a political formation that doesn’t take a distance from those who deny human rights, like the Vox party [in Spain] and Orbán,” Rizzitelli said. “But if you analyse it from the Italian political reality, it’s not so surprising because the PD is so far removed from civil society, and has distanced itself so much from part of a population that needed another response. Italy is not only made up of a cultural elite that sides with the PD, but of ordinary working people who more easily understood what Meloni had to offer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/05/climate-change-carbon-budget-emissions-payment-usa-uk-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T17:02:37Z","webTitle":"Rich countries with high greenhouse gas emissions could pay $170tn in climate reparations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/climate-change-carbon-budget-emissions-payment-usa-uk-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/05/climate-change-carbon-budget-emissions-payment-usa-uk-germany","fields":{"bodyText":"Rich industrialised countries responsible for excessive levels of greenhouse gas emissions could be liable to pay $170tn in climate reparations by 2050 to ensure targets to curtail climate breakdown are met, a new study calculates. The proposed compensation, which amounts to almost $6tn annually, would be paid to historically low-polluting developing countries that must transition away from fossil fuels despite not having yet used their “fair share” of the global carbon budget, according to the analysis published in the journal Nature Sustainability. The compensation system is based on the idea that the atmosphere is a commons, a natural resource for everyone which has not been used equitably. It is the first scheme where wealthy countries historically responsible for excessive or unjust greenhouse emissions including the UK, US, Germany, Japan and Russia, are held liable to compensate countries which have contributed the least to global heating – but must decarbonise their economies by 2050 if we are to keep global heating below 1.5C and avert the most catastrophic climate breakdown. In this ambitious scenario, the study found that 55 countries including most of sub-Saharan Africa and India would have to sacrifice more than 75% of their fair share of the carbon budget. On the other hand, the UK has used 2.5 times its fair allocation, and would be liable to pay $7.7tn for its excessive emissions by 2050. The US has used more than four times its fair share to become the richest country in the world, and would be responsible for $80tn in reparations under this scheme. “It is a matter of climate justice that if we are asking nations to rapidly decarbonise their economies, even though they hold no responsibility for the excess emissions that are destabilising the climate, then they should be compensated for this unfair burden,” said Andrew Fanning, lead author and visiting research fellow at the University of Leeds’s Sustainability Research Institute. In order to keep global heating to below 1.5C, the total global carbon budget starting from 1960 is 1.8tn tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) figures. Using population size, researchers calculated how much 168 countries have over- or under-used their fair share of the global carbon budget since 1960. Some countries were within their fair share allocation, while the global north (the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Israel) have already massively overshot their fair share of the atmospheric commons. Almost 90% of the excess emissions are down to the wealthy global north, while the remainder are from high-emitting countries in the global south, especially oil-rich states such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Five low-emitting countries with large populations – India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria and China (currently the world’s largest emitter) – would be entitled to receive $102tn, for sacrificing their fair share of the carbon budget in the zero emissions scenario. “Climate change reflects clear patterns of atmospheric colonisation,” said Jason Hickel, co-author and professor at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. “Responsibility for excess emissions is largely held by the wealthy classes [within nations] who have very high consumption and who wield disproportionate power over production and national policy. They are the ones who must bear the costs of compensation.” Demands are mounting to compensate climate-vulnerable countries for the threats they face due to the excessive greenhouse gas emissions of others, as part of a broader climate justice movement to make polluters pay for the climate crisis and green energy transition. Last year at the UN’s Cop27 summit, states agreed to establish a “loss and damage” financing fund to provide funds to poor countries for the irreparable and unavoidable economic and non-economic costs of extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters such as sea level rise and melting glaciers. According to research published last month, the world’s top oil, gas and coal companies are responsible for $5.4tn (£4.3tn) in drought, wildfires, sea level rise and melting glaciers among other climate catastrophes expected between 2025 and 2050. This was the first study quantifying the economic burden caused by individual companies that have extracted – and continue to extract – wealth from planet-heating fossil fuels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/apr/11/worlds-deepest-offshore-wind-turbine-scottish-coast-sse-seagreen","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-11T14:32:49Z","webTitle":"World’s deepest offshore wind turbine installed off Scottish coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/worlds-deepest-offshore-wind-turbine-scottish-coast-sse-seagreen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/apr/11/worlds-deepest-offshore-wind-turbine-scottish-coast-sse-seagreen","fields":{"bodyText":"The world’s deepest offshore wind turbine has been installed almost 17 miles off the coast of Angus as part of Scotland’s biggest offshore windfarm. The Scottish energy company SSE installed the 2,000-tonne turbine foundation at a depth of more than 58 metres (192ft) in the early hours of Easter Sunday as part of the £3bn Seagreen offshore windfarm, which it is developing in partnership with the French oil supermajor TotalEnergies. The record-breaking foundation will be Seagreen’s 112th turbine, of a total of 114; the project will power the equivalent of 1.6m homes. The 1GW windfarm began generating electricity in August last year and will be fully operational by the summer. Alistair Phillips-Davies, the SSE chief executive, said the installation was a significant step towards completing the project and also showed how the company has been able to “innovate and push the boundaries of technology to power change”. The Seagreen windfarm is part of SSE’s plan to invest £12.5bn by 2026 in projects that can accelerate the UK’s path towards becoming a net zero economy. By the end of the decade SSE, which is developing the world’s largest offshore windfarm at Dogger Bank in the North Sea, plans to invest a total of £24bn in the UK alone. SSE is one of the UK’s biggest renewable energy generators, but has raised its full-year profit forecasts twice for the financial year ending 31 March thanks to the lucrative revenues earned by its gas power plants. “The UK has established itself as the world leader on offshore wind and SSE Renewables is building more offshore wind than anyone on the planet,” Phillips-Davies said. “But we want to do more and now is the time to accelerate if we are to achieve the UK’s target of 50GW of offshore wind by 2030.” Graham Stuart, the minister of state for energy security and net zero, added: “This is another terrific milestone for both Scotland and the UK’s world-leading offshore wind industry. As I saw first-hand last week, Seagreen is making history with the world’s deepest wind turbine foundation which, once operational, will play an invaluable role in powering more of Britain from Britain.” SSE was once one of the UK’s biggest domestic energy suppliers but the company sold its household retail business to Ovo Energy in a £500m deal so it could focus on developing renewable power projects. • This article was amended on 13 April 2023.

The rebuke, in the form of a motion to be voted on at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, will not lead to Iran’s non-compliance being referred to the UN security council, nor to an extension of sanctions on Iran. But it reflects growing anxiety that Iran is not providing the cooperation IAEA inspectors need to declare its nuclear programme is peaceful. Iran has progressively reduced the IAEA’s access in what it says is a graduated and reversible response to US sanctions. In a joint statement to the board, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal – the UK, France and Germany – also condemn Iran’s broader attitude to non-proliferation, saying: “Iran’s nuclear programme is now more advanced than at any point in the past,” and adding that Iran’s accumulation of enriched uranium has no “credible civilian justification”. The three countries say: “Iran’s nuclear advances are not only dangerous and illegal, they risk unravelling the deal that we have so carefully crafted together to restore the nuclear deal. The more Iran is advancing and accumulating knowledge with irreversible consequences, the more difficult it is to come back to the deal.” They add: “Neither the IAEA nor the international community know how many centrifuges Iran has in its inventory, how many were built where they are located precisely at the point it is expanding its programme and component manufacturing and centrifuge assembling capabilities.” On Wednesday, Iran disconnected some of the UN watchdog’s cameras monitoring its nuclear sites, its atomic energy agency said. The motion to the board, separate from the joint statement, is seen by the west as the minimum necessary to maintain the credibility of the nuclear inspectorate after its director general, Rafael Grossi, reported that his inspectorate had not been receiving the required cooperation from Iran. Grossi said Iran had not provided technically credible explanations about the presence of uranium particles at three undeclared sites, two years after the IAEA board adopted a resolution expressing serious concern about Iranian stonewalling. The new motion does not set a deadline for Iranian cooperation, and is relatively mildly worded, partly to ensure it secures the required two-thirds majority of the 35-member board. But Russian diplomats have joined Iran in criticising the motion, and said they will not be associated with it. China is likely to express opposition as well. Iran has not been specific about how it will respond. With the separate talks in Vienna about the US rejoining the 2015 nuclear agreement on life support, a motion at the IAEA board criticising Iran’s bona fides may make an agreement even more elusive. Negotiations on a new nuclear agreement began in April 2021 and the last round finished in March. Throughout the talks in Vienna the US delegation has been negotiating indirectly with Iran, but the talks have stalled over the US refusal to lift its designation of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation. In Washington, opposition to the Biden administration rejoining the agreement has been growing. Iran is also dubious about guarantees that US sanctions will be lifted. Iran claims Grossi, an experienced diplomat, is dancing to Israel’s tune by criticising the level of Iranian disclosures at the three sites, saying the information on which he is acting has been provided by Israel. Grossi visited Israel and not Iran before the board of governors meeting, as he did on the eve of the last two meetings, which some viewed as a sign that the agency was preparing to escalate its position towards Iran. Grossi has used his visits to Tehran to extract last-minute commitments that IAEA cameras will remain operating at Iran’s nuclear sites, and the footage, although not currently accessible to the IAEA, would be kept on memory cards. Grossi denied he had wanted to send a political message through his visit to Tel Aviv and his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. At a press conference this week, Grossi said the impasse would be a “reminder for Iran, and for us, and for everybody, that we really need to get down to work and clarify these issues that have been outstanding for too long”. The IAEA signed an agreement with Iran last March in which Tehran pledged to provide answers to the agency to questions related to the inspectors’ finding of uranium traces at secret sites. Iran says it has no obligation to respond to questions raised by the agency on the basis of forged or unreliable documents. It says it has provided the agency with all necessary information and supporting documents on a voluntary basis and provided the necessary access and answers to the agency’s questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jun/15/australia-news-live-updates-decision-due-on-lifting-minimum-wage-albanese-takes-cabinet-to-queensland-anthony-albanese-inflation-philip-lowe-rba-interest-rates-gladstone-electricity-blackouts-aemo","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-15T09:31:57Z","webTitle":"NSW residents urged to conserve power – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/15/australia-news-live-updates-decision-due-on-lifting-minimum-wage-albanese-takes-cabinet-to-queensland-anthony-albanese-inflation-philip-lowe-rba-interest-rates-gladstone-electricity-blackouts-aemo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/15/australia-news-live-updates-decision-due-on-lifting-minimum-wage-albanese-takes-cabinet-to-queensland-anthony-albanese-inflation-philip-lowe-rba-interest-rates-gladstone-electricity-blackouts-aemo","fields":{"bodyText":"OK that was a big day – and we are going to put this blog to bed now. But before we go, let’s recap the big stories: The Australian Energy Market Operator suspended the spot market for electricity nationally for the first time, and New South Wales residents were asked to reduce power in the evening if safe. The RBA boss, Philip Lowe, announced inflation could hit 7%. Sarah Hanson-Young said Australia was being “held hostage’ by energy companies. Bill Shorten highlighted the wider economic benefits of NDIS. Derryn Hinch confirmed he will run for parliament in Victoria. Brisbane says it will increase council rates on short-stay rental properties to help address housing crisis. The Fair Work Commission ruled on 5.2% increase to minimum wage, which was welcomed by the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, welcomed the increase while the chamber of commerce boss said wages should be flexible and “driven by the market”. Consumer sentiment plunged towards historic low, according to a Westpac survey. Blackstone’s takeover of Crown Resorts approved by federal court. Thank you for spending today with us – we will be back again tomorrow! Plans to rewild captive koalas in New South Wales A new project aims to “rewild” captive koalas by gently releasing them into larger sanctuaries, AAP reports. The plan is to house the endangered marsupials at a breeding site near a NSW national park before releasing them into a safe, 1,500-hectare wild sanctuary in the state’s north. The goal is to equip the animals with the necessary skills to flourish in a wild environment – called “wild translocation”. Conservation groups WildArk and Aussie Ark aim to launch the project in 2023 once facilities are built, predators and weeds are removed, and protective fencing is in place. The organisations are partnering with ice-cream brands Connoisseur and NUII to realise the project. The federal government in February uplisted the conservation status of koalas from vulnerable to endangered, as recommended by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. In May, the NSW government also listed koalas as endangered. Victorian energy minister says state has sufficient reserves After a big afternoon Peter Hannam has clocked off but he wanted me to share this last thought with you: “If Vivid Sydney goes dark, what do you get? Livid Sydney?” We also have a statement from the Victorian minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio. Aemo have advised that we continue to have sufficient energy reserves and that the suspension is to protect energy users and put certainty back into the market. We have been engaging very regularly with Aemo and understood they were considering a range of options, including suspending the National Energy Market. It is disappointing that energy generators were potentially gaming the system and not utilising the options available to them – this behaviour is unacceptable and will be investigated. We continue to push for reforms that put the needs of Victorians ahead of big company profits. Victorian households and businesses continue to be in a better position than those in the other eastern states due to our nation leading investments in renewables. This investment is delivering cheaper energy prices for Victorian households and businesses, while we work towards net zero emissions by 2050. Socceroos back on home soil The Socceroos have landed back home after securing a place in the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

Victorian Greens convener criticised for past comments about trans people The newly elected Victorian Greens convener, Linda Gale, co-authored a 2019 document which has been described as “inconsistent with Greens values”. Senator Janet Rice says Gale’s position is “untenable” unless she distances herself from the comments that have been labelled transphobic. Read the story here: Greater gliders get new homes after fires Greater gliders that lost their tree-trunk homes in the black summer bushfires have been given new hi-tech digs with great insulation, top-notch security and killer views, AAP reports. The world’s largest gliding marsupial was already considered vulnerable to extinction before ferocious bushfires wiped out almost a third of its habitat. Experts quickly realised they were facing a housing crisis, with the flames destroying mature, hollow trees the gliders use for shelter. Their minds turned to nesting boxes as a stop-gap measure. But standard models with their thin walls and lack of thermal protection were unsuitable for gliders, which won’t eat if they get too hot. That’s a recipe for death within days because gliders have low fat stores and rely on low-calorie eucalypt leaves for both food and water. “They are just like us,” Dr Kara Youngentob, from the Australian National University, said. “We don’t feel like a big meal when we’re hot and neither do they. But their food isn’t full of energy and fat. “They also get all of their water from their leaves. So when they’re not eating as much they get dehydrated.” The NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, has called on residents in his state to reduce their power consumption this evening to help the grid cope with a lack of supply. As it stands, the crunch time will come about 8.30pm, according to Aemo’s latest alert for NSW. If there is an opportunity to reduce their energy usage, like not using their dishwasher until they go to bed, that would help. A number of coal-fired power stations that were expected to be working tonight have not come online, Kean said. Vivid will still go ahead, he said. Earlier, Kean welcomed the decision to suspend the wholesale power market across the five eastern states and the ACT – the first time the proverbial plug has been pulled on the whole scheme. This decision will help prevent energy companies from putting energy reliability at risk by unnecessarily withdrawing supply. I expect power companies to do the right thing by their customers and the country. We will continue to work closely with the federal government and other states as well as the independent market operator to navigate the situation in the Nem. Richard Marles to attend Commonwealth meeting in Rwanda The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, confirmed he would be representing Australia at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda next week. He is also set to visit to India next week to reinforce ties with the country. Anthony Albanese meets Nadesalingam family On Twitter, the PM said he had met with the Nadesalingam family. Richard Marles speaks of greater cooperation between Australia and Japan in the Pacific The defence minister, Richard Marles, has also spoken about the potential for “greater cooperation between Australia and Japan in the Pacific”. Marles said the issue came up during the meeting with Japan’s defence minister, Nobuo Kishi, in Tokyo today. Marles told reporters: The Pacific is obviously a part of the world which is deeply critical for Australia, but it’s also a part of the world where Japan has had a long engagement. And I’ve seen that first-hand in the work that I’ve done in Pacific island countries. Japan’s reputation amongst Pacific Island countries for the provision of infrastructure is unsurpassed. They do a wonderful job. Today, they [Japan] talked about doing more port visits to countries in the Pacific, including Solomon Islands. That’s a really important initiative that we welcome. And earlier this year, Australia and Japan worked together in terms of the provision of assistance to Tonga after the tsunami. Asked about joint ventures on infrastructure in the Pacific, Marles said partnering with Japan was “fundamentally a good idea” and “the more we do that, the better”. When we combine resources, we can do so much more. Japan acknowledges Australia’s proximity to the Pacific, the fact that the Pacific is an area where we seek to lead in the context of other countries’ engagement in the Pacific. We talk in terms of earning the right that we seek to do to be the natural partner of choice of the countries in the Pacific. Japan supports that and welcomes that. But there are things that Japan can do in the Pacific which greatly add to our joint capability and one of those is infrastructure. Ahead of foreign minister Penny Wong’s visit to Honiara this Friday, Marles said the new Australian government wanted to send a message to Solomon Islands “that we intend to make the Pacific an absolute focus of our foreign policy”. We want to revitalise our relationships in the Pacific – we are going to do the work. Richard Marles asked about meeting with Chinese counterpart The defence minister, Richard Marles, was also asked about his meeting on Sunday with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in Singapore and whether the trade tensions had been part of that discussion. Marles confirmed that he had raised China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands in Sunday’s meeting. Marles said there were other discussions that he would not disclose publicly, but added: The meeting with Minister Wei began and more importantly ended with a desire on the part of both of us to try and put the bilateral relationship [between China and Australia] into a better place, not just in terms of the area of defence, but generally. Marles reiterated that it was “only the first step” and there was “a long way to go”. (The trade minister, Don Farrell, has not been able to secure a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of a World Trade Organization conference in Geneva this week.) Japan and Australia are the very best of friends, deputy PM says in Tokyo Richard Marles has spoken to reporters in Tokyo. The defence minister and deputy prime minister said the relationship with Japan was “front and centre in terms of our national interests”. He said today’s meeting with his counterpart, Nobuo Kishi, was “of real substance”. He said in the 1980s commerce was at the heart of the Australia-Japan relationship. That element remained, he said, but now the building of the defence and security relationship was “at the heart of the work we are doing together”. Marles said the pair had used today’s meeting to “put the meat on the bones” of a defence deal – the reciprocal access agreement – that was reached under the former Morrison government. That agreement sets up a legal framework for their forces to train in each other’s territory: It allows our defence forces to operate in each other’s countries and I think what we will see is more of that. We take this a step at a time. Marles said that Japan would, for the first time, send aircraft to participate in the Royal Australian Air Force’s Exercise Pitch Black in August. He said that was “emblematic of the kind of activity that we can both engage in going forward”. From the perspective of Australia, we obviously see Japan as being really important to our strategic future. But what’s been so gratifying about this visit is that that feeling is reciprocated. It’s very clear that from the perspective of Japan, they see their relationship with us in Australia as being one of the highest order. That presents such an enormous opportunity for us to take the relationship forward and we were very pleased to be able to take steps in doing that today. This all comes days after Marles met with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in Singapore on Sunday, ending a diplomatic freeze of more than two years. Marles’ trip to Japan appears to be designed, in part, to assert that Australia is not changing its fundamental foreign policy and defence settings. Marles said: It is really clear that when times are tough, friends come to the fore. And today, Japan and Australia are the very best of friends. NSW treasurer Matt Kean to speak on electricity market The NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, will address the media at 5.15pm following the decision to suspend the electricity market. We will bring you that when it comes. Union calls for review of ‘broken’ national electricity market The Electrical Trades Union is calling for an independent review of the entire national electricity market (Nem) following the unprecedented decision by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) to take over national energy supplies. The union’s acting national secretary, Michael Wright, said: The ETU has been sounding the alarm about the Nem for years. This vindicates our long-held concerns that the market is broken and beyond repair. The experiment in synthetic markets, trying to deliver essential public services through profit-motivated, tax-avoiding multinational energy corporations, has failed shockingly. Gas and coal companies prioritising the export market is just a symptom of a problem, not the cause. The cause is complete regulatory failure. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and energy minister Chris Bowen now have a clear mandate to step in and order an urgent review of the entire national electricity market. Even if Aemo’s unprecedented intervention gets us through this acute phase of the crisis, we cannot return to the status quo. There is a serious question of whether the Nem should ever be allowed to resume. A national review must consider how to remove the dead wood of rampant financialisation and short-termism that now dominates the Nem, which is placing a huge brake on the energy sector’s capacity to improve productivity and efficiency. The Australian Electoral Commission has confirmed the Senate results in South Australia, with three Liberals, two Labor and one Greens senator elected. As expected, Simon Birmingham, Andrew McLachlan and Kerrynne Liddle will represent the Liberals, with ministers Penny Wong and Don Farrell for the Labor government, and Barbara Pocock for the Greens. The first five senators on the AEC list were all expected to be elected for some time, but the only possible wildcard was the small possibility of One Nation grabbing the final seat – but that went to Liddle and the Liberals. It’s also now confirmed that former Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon has again missed out, after another unsuccessful bid for office. You might remember he quit the Senate in 2017, in a bid to run for the South Australian state parliament, but that didn’t pan out. He announced a late bid to return to the federal Senate shortly before the election, but that too has now been confirmed as unsuccessful. Xenophon congratulated the winners in a video posted to Twitter. Westerman says other states not affected by market suspension Westerman is asked if any other states are facing blackouts – he says they are mainly worried about New South Wales. Reporter: “Are there any other states that could be facing blackouts?” What I’m saying is that in NSW in particular, we are concerned about the supply and demand balance for this evening, potentially tomorrow we would urge consumers in NSW only, to conserve energy where it is safe to do so. We are doing everything we can to make sure we have sufficient generation on tap to meet supply. He said other factors adding to this include: “The effect of the international crisis on gas, coal, availability of coal plants.” Reporter: “How... do we not get into this situation in the future?” That is a question for policymakers. It is a policy question, what I’m focused on is making sure we have sufficient electricity to meet customer needs. Westerman: market will restart when generators co-operate Westerman says by suspending the market they are creating one simple place where generators can put all their availability and it can be dispatched in a methodical way. We will restart the market once we are confident the market will co-operate. What we are doing today is suspending the market because we see it is impossible to operate the market under current circumstances, and we will reassess that every day. Once we are confident we can operate it and not see generators withdrawing their availability then we will restart the market. Westerman: electricity prices won’t rise as result of market suspension A reporter has asked if prices will go up because of this – but Westerman says they won’t. Under market suspension rules we have worked off a pricing schedule reflective of prices over a trailing period, generators will be receiving compensation based on prices over the past month. We will have to check that. So, it’s not true to say that prices would go up under this market suspension mechanism. Westerman: NSW residents should conserve energy if safe to do so Westerman is asked if Australians can use normal heating tonight – he said he is asking NSW residents to conserve their energy where it is safe to do so. Reporter: “Is this the sign that the national electricity market is challenged?” We are seeing very challenging times, right now we see the market is not able to deal with all the factors thrown at it, frankly those factors are quite extreme, ranging from generators that are both planned and unplanned outages, very high demand, a confluence of factors at hand. Westerman: generators will have clear process to recover costs Reporter: “Is this the best possible option?” Westerman: We have seen a large amount of generators pull availability from the electricity market facing higher cost, we have faced high demand profiles due to the cold weather, input costs have increased due to the international factors, we have had a few transmission line outages which has resulted in a price rise. Reporter: “Will generators still be compensated?” Westerman: By suspending the market we are putting in a simple process to put in their input and have a clear process to recover their cost. Aemo boss: first time national market has been suspended Journalist: “How long do you envisage the suspension to last for?” Westerman: We will reinstate the market once we are confident we can operate it, we will reevaluate that on a daily basis. He is asked how unprecedented this move is: We suspended the market in Tasmania and South Australia last year so it is a process familiar to market participants. This is the first time it has been done nationally. Market suspension best for consumers, Aemo says Westerman says this will deliver the best outcome for Australian consumers. The suspension of the market is a temporary measure and will be reviewed daily. We will return the market to its normal state once Aemo is confident that we can operate the market again and not see generators withdraw their availability. Practically, this means we are creating one simple process where generators can put their availability and have a simple, clear process for them to recover their costs. Prior to suspending the market today, Aemo had issued over 5,000 megawatts of directions and that is roughly 20% of demand. And it is simply not possible to operate the market in this way. These actions today, we are confident will deliver the best outcome for Australian consumers. Daniel Westerman says today, Aemo has suspended the national electricity market. This decision was made because it was impossible to operate the system under current conditions while ensuring reliable, secure supply of electricity to Australian homes and businesses. By suspending the market, we are creating a simple process where Aemo has true visibility of which generators are available and when in advance, rather than relying on last minute interventions. That visibility will help us to manage the system in real-time as well as to understand the balance of supply and demand in the period ahead. Despite this, conditions remain tight in the coming days, in particular in New South Wales where we would urge consumers to conserve energy where it is safe to do so. We are going now to Adelaide where the chief executive of the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), Daniel Westerman, is speaking ... Peter Dutton says Chris Bowen has to fix electricity problem ... No word yet from the political leaders about the big energy story this afternoon. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the energy minister, Chris Bowen, are in Gladstone. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who’s in Perth, has got to the microphone first. “I worry it is going to be tough under Labor,” he says. Dutton says the Coalition kept electricity prices low – but that was for about a two-year period, and they left most of the mess facing Albanese, it would seem. “Bowen’s aged 20 years” since he’s been in the job, Dutton says. “Because he doesn’t know what to do.” “This a problem of Chris Bowen’s making, and he’s got to fix it.” That seems a tad tough on a minister who’s barely had a fortnight in the job, but there you go. As for energy, you can read more of our report here: Even though the market has been suspended, we’re still getting updated lack of reserve notices, which is slightly confusing. Will they keep sending these, showing the forecast shortfall for New South Wales? We are expecting the press conference from Aemo any time now ... Australia’s foreign affairs minister will meet the prime minister of Solomon Islands in Honiara on Friday, attempting to mend ties after the Pacific country signed a security agreement with China. Trade minister wants free trade agreement with EU by end of year The trade minister, Don Farrell, has spoken to Sky News from Geneva, where he has been attending a World Trade Organization conference. Farrell hasn’t had the opportunity to meet his Chinese counterpart but reiterated that Australia would be happy to meet any time to discuss the removal of trade sanctions against Australian export sectors. Farrell said he would meet the French trade minister later today – the latest sign of improving ties after the Aukus-fuelled rift under the former government. Farrell said he was hopeful for the early resumption of negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement. I’d like to think we could get a free trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year. Narrator voice: Farrell hereby joins the great tradition of politicians setting end-of-year deadlines for trade talks. Farrell adds: Relationships are being repaired, not just in Asia but right around the world with this new government. Backing the wage rise shows Labor is on the side of workers at a time when many are doing it tough, writes Sarah Martin. Electricity spot market suspension will bring stability, Aemo says With the Australian Energy Market Operator now suspending the wholesale spot market, people will be wondering what it all means, and what comes next. Firstly, Aemo will go into more detail in an hour’s time (so 4pm AEST), but basically the system of identifying market shortfalls had “become unsustainable”, a spokesperson said. The spokesperson confirmed it was the first time the entire market had been suspended. It was not caused by a single event but rather a build-up over the past few days when an ever-growing number of forecast shortfalls were emerging. The last main interruption was linked to the “SA black” event in 2016, when tornados knocked over key transmission lines and a bunch of windfarms exceeded their settings, and were turned off (but they were NOT the main problem). Suspending the market does not mean we’re about to get blackouts. “Hopefully, this [suspension] will bring more stability to operations,” the Aemo spokesperson said. The planned meeting of regulators with generators did NOT go ahead as planned, the Australian Energy Regulator has just let know. Aemo’s market suspension rendered such a meeting redundant, it seems. Traditional owners attempting to block the construction of a nuclear waste dump in South Australia have told a court the federal government has already approved plans to begin earthworks, despite an active legal challenge. We are expecting a press conference on the electricity market situation at 4pm AEST. NSW disaster agencies defend flood response New South Wales disaster management agencies have defended their rescue and recovery response to the record-breaking floods which claimed 13 lives earlier this year, AAP reports. The NSW resilience commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, the State Emergency Service boss, Carlene York, and the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Rob Rogers, appeared on the final day of hearings before an upper house committee on Wednesday. The inquiry is examining the authorities’ ability to save lives and property during the catastrophic floods and is separate to the government’s own investigation. The committee chairman, Labor MP Walt Secord, said communities in the state’s north were angry that Resilience NSW had treated the “fourth worst natural disaster” in modern Australian history as a “nine-to-five job”. But Fitzsimmons vigorously defended the agency’s conduct in reaching and supporting flood evacuees. We’re not a 24-hour organisation. We don’t have thousands of personnel. We’re active and engaged but we’re only a couple of hundred people. We don’t have the scale or resourcing during the response phase of these events. York said 13 lives were lost from late February until early April across the state, with the town of Lismore in the Northern Rivers region hit the hardest. The SES was dispatched to more than 2,200 flood rescues and responded to in excess of 33,400 requests for help. Minimum wage increase ‘pitiful’, Antipoverty Centre says The Antipoverty Centre has released a statement in relation to the wage increase – saying the daily pay rise would not even cover the cost of iceberg lettuce. Jay Coonan, an Antipoverty Centre spokesperson, said: The Antipoverty Centre is relieved that some low paid workers will soon get a pay rise, many of whom do not earn enough to get above the poverty line. But $1 an hour is a pitiful increase that maintains the status quo and does not meaningfully improve lives – it won’t even buy an iceberg lettuce for a day’s work. We are disturbed by the decision to delay the increase for workers in aviation, tourism and hospitality. There is no justification for prioritising businesses over the wellbeing of the workers they rely on. Announcing the wages decision the Fair Work Commission president said ‘low paid workers are particularly vulnerable’ – so what does that make the five million people who rely on poverty-level Centrelink payments? Our payments are becoming worth less with each day, and so far we’ve heard nothing but repeated commitments from the new government to keep it that way. After all those notices about shortfalls in the wholesale spot electricity market serving eastern Australia, it looks like the Australian Energy Market Operator has blown a whistle, and the game is suspended ... More on this soon. Energy generators meet to discuss electricity market Eastern Australia’s generators are sitting down with the members of the Energy Security Board to chat about how the electricity market is going. They will no doubt be discussing why generators are withdrawing capacity and then being asked to supply it by the regulators. And presumably they will discuss how to avoid worrying the public about possible electricity supply shortfalls. Take New South Wales, for instance, where the projected “lack of reserve level 3” (LOR 3) implies a lot of gaps need filling, particularly one at 8pm tomorrow evening with 4,000 megawatts needed. (At present, NSW as a whole is using about 6,100MW.) It can be hard to keep up, since Victoria also has a bunch of LOR 3s, including tomorrow at 6.30pm when 2,000MW of supply needs to be found. These gaps are being closed, but sometimes the regulator has to intervene and tell a lucky generator it’s time to switch on, as happened earlier today in Victoria. Queensland and South Australia have also been in the mix today as far as projected shortfalls. The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, this morning told RN Breakfast the market was an “embarrassment”. Given we might have a few weeks or longer to go before the supply risks subside, we might want to consider how the messaging can be tweaked. Otherwise we might not be ready when a real crisis looms ... Encrypted apps must be regulated to curb far-right extremism, inquiry told From AAP: The federal government needs to take action against encrypted messaging apps like Telegram to curb the rise of far-right extremism, a Victorian inquiry has been told. Far-right extremists initially shared hateful content on mainstream sites like Facebook and Twitter but are increasingly being deplatformed, Swinburne University’s Dr Belinda Barnet told Wednesday’s hearing. The groups are now moving to spaces like Telegram where they can share their ideas without censure or detection from the authorities, which is dangerous, Barnet said. These apps are also allowing the far right to draw in people from the “fringes of society”, Swinburne University’s Associate Prof Christine Agius told the parliamentary inquiry. They often share grievances around perceived entitlement – that society has changed too much, feminism has gone too far, and minority groups are taking what’s rightfully theirs. Erickson: ‘There’s a lot to reflect on’ about the media during the campaign Jumping back to the National Press Club, Erickson was asked about the media: Joel Fitzgibbon appointed to forest industry board From AAP: Former Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon says the forest industry has a strong role to play in climate mitigation and jobs provision. The former minister and MP for the New South Wales seat of Hunter has been appointed to the Australian Forest Products Association board as an independent non-executive director. “As the former minister and shadow minister for forestry, I have met many of AFPA’s members and have seen firsthand the countless benefits the industry provides to Australia’s economy and the livelihoods of Australians,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “[The] industry is passionate about the role it can play in climate mitigation, building our regional communities by providing meaningful and secure jobs and delivering the millions of fibre-based products we often take for granted – from timber for houses, to paper and tissue products. “I look forward to working with my board colleagues and AFPA management as we look to the future of forest industries.” The AFPA chair, Greg McCormack, said Fitzgibbon would bring to the board passionate support for forest industries. “[And he] understands intimately how we can assist the new Albanese government deliver both greater climate change initiatives and more timber for our builders and renovators,” McCormack said. “Joel’s vast experience in both strategic vision and policy development will provide valuable input for the AFPA board and in dealings with all levels of the government and the public service as we all try to deliver on the more than $300m in new initiatives Labor committed to during the election, along with key policy changes.” Labor not concerned about rise of independents and Greens, Erickson suggests Paul Karp: “I note the seats that you had climate swings to you – Bennelong, Chisholm, Higgins and Boothby. Only one of them had a high-profile independent and none of them were top-tier Greens targets. So my question is: how worried are you that those will be the next to fall to a growing crossbench if Labor doesn’t lift its ambition on climate?” Erickson: I’m confident of the four members that were elected in those seats that they’ll do an excellent job over the next three years. I think if we look at the teal seats, the issues that were in play in those seats were the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Mr Morrison’s performance as prime minister, and anger at the Liberal party over climate, over the treatment of women and over integrity. The 2022 election and the contest between the Liberals and the teals played out with those issues and on the terms that we saw. So I don’t think that you can extrapolate from that much, if anything, about what the next election might look like and what it means for the Labor government. Erickson: Greens ‘seek to divide Labor’s base in a manner that doesn’t help progressive politics’ On the Greens, Erickson says: I think there’s in doubt that the Greens are an effective campaign machine and they do have a very successful strategy that they have honed over 20 years, which is to always position yourself two steps to the left of Labor, minimise our successes, give zero credit for any of the progressive gains that Labor governments make, constantly criticise and seek to divide Labor’s base in a manner that doesn’t help progressive politics. That’s what Adam’s entire adult life has been about. Erickson: ‘The test is not whether you can run a mistake-free campaign. The test is how do you respond when new challenges emerge’ David Crowe from SMH and The Age: “What are your reflections on the mistakes, if any, in that campaign?” Erickson: No campaign is perfect. The experience of every campaign is the challenges are constantly thrown at you and things go wrong. The test is not whether you can run a mistake-free campaign. The test is how do you respond when new challenges emerge, when events throw unexpected dynamics at you, or when mistakes happen. It was even more so the case in this campaign because of Covid. We were constantly having people get sick. I missed a week, the leader missed a week, the president, the assistant national secretary, I think around half of the cabinet. So it was just constantly coming at us. And so the way I think to deal with that is as a campaigner is just to maintain that focus on what is your strategy, what are you trying to do? And that’s how we dealt with and grappled with challenges as they came along. Labor can continue to build support and lift primary vote, Erickson says Greg Brown from The Australian asks if the days of 40% primary votes are over. Erickson: No, no, I think there are lots of examples around the world and through Australia’s history of a government like this one coming into office in circumstances like this and then building its support and building its support through good government and by delivering on what it promised. I think we have seen, you know, the Ardern government in New Zealand is a good example in terms of looking at their result in 2017, and then their re-election, there have been examples at a state level here in Australia in the recent history of state Labor governments. And that’s the challenge that’s in front of us. ‘We did win in our right’: Labor national secretary Phil Coorey from the AFR: “What is it in your view that Labor needs to do over the next three years to get that primary vote up and to win it in your own right without the factors that helped you last time?” Erickson: We did win in our own right. And don’t agree with the proposition that my speech or my remarks have made an argument that we didn’t win it and they lost it. I think in my remarks I set out how we thought about the election and that we felt that we had two arguments we had to make. First, how would Australia be different under a Labor government led by Anthony Albanese? And we set that case out. We set it out in principle in terms of Anthony’s leadership style and we set it out in detail on issues like climate, childcare, health and wages and the cost of living. Erickson denies misleading voters on cashless debit card Labor national secretary Paul Erickson is now taking questions at the National Press Club. Anna Henderson from SBS: “Labor was accused during the election campaign of misleading voters in relation to the cashless debit card and paid advertising suggests it was going to be expanded to all age pensioners. On reflection, was that a lie?” Erickson: Absolutely it was not a lie. We campaigned against the cashless debit card and pointed to the Liberal government and Anne Ruston the former minister’s own words and we have now taken steps as we committed to abolish the cashless debit card. And with that, I will hand the blog over to the wonderful Cait Kelly for the rest of the day. Thanks for reading. Paul Erickson has summarised why the Coalition lost in eight key points: One, a pathological refusal to take responsibility for anything which comes from their small government mindset. Two, incompetent management of the Federal Government’s responsibilities during the pandemic. Three, cabinet-wide partisan attacks on state and territory governments throughout Covid which particularly alienated voters in Victoria and Western Australia. Four, incompetent budget management. Five, an incompetent and incoherent response to the cost of living crisis. Six, incoherent engagement with our allies in our region. Seven, a lack of awareness or interest in women’s experiences across the economy and society. Eight, a decades long failure to take climate change seriously. Scott Morrison may have come to personify these failures but they are institutional and collective, not individual. They’re actively prosecuted by senior cabinet ministers and all Coalition leaders, including the two men then seen as the only likely successors to Scott Morrison – Josh Frydenberg and Peter Dutton. Paul Erickson says Coalition’s ‘all out assault’ on states amid Covid was ‘galling’ Paul Erickson makes particular point of discussing the gendered approach the Morrison government often took to particular issues, including the response to Covid. Erickson first pointed out the Coalition’s “galling” choice to engaging in an “all out assault” on state and territory Labor governments: It was odd and then galling to watch the Liberals commence an all out assault on state and territory Labor governments in the second half of 2020 over the Covid response. This began with the passive cynicism of Morrison reducing his daily media appearances as second wave outbreaks in New South Wales and Victoria took off, leaving it to the premiers to front the bad news. It started at the top, but this strategy was pursued with enthusiasm by the entire Coalition led not just by Morrison but by the whole of the cabinet. This was followed by Morrison’s recklessly partisan [criticism] of the Andrew’s government roadmap back to normal, which the media establishment outside of Melbourne misunderstood in my judgement. Morrison’s cynical criticism of the Palaszczuk’s government border closure in the lead-up of the state election was beneath any prime minister. And of course the Liberals backed Clive Palmer’s failed high court challenge to the WA border closure. Morrison showed he had a ‘failure to understand women’, Erikson says Erickson then points out two interesting points: the first, that the Morrison government put forward its network of cabinet ministers and advisors “shaping government policy”, and 13 of the 14 were men. Next, Erickson points out the Morrison government ended free childcare, as well as going back over his response to Australia reckoning with “workplace culture and bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in parliamentary and political workplaces”. Women suffered the most during the pandemic, yet the Liberal response demonstrated either a lack of awareness or a lack of interest. Scott Morrison’s strange inability to comprehend life outside his own experiences had already been on display. . I’m not here to offer any partisan conclusions about the culture of Parliament House, but in the context of this year’s federal election I would make this observation: two of Scott Morrison’s comments from that period continued to come up in our research right up until the election day as indicative of his failure to understand women. First, that it wasn’t until he considered these issues as a husband and a father that he was able to reflect and listen. And secondly, that women who marched outside Parliament House were lucky not to be met with bullets. Labor national secretary says voters rejected Coalition and ‘more of the same’ Labor’s national secretary and election campaign director, Paul Erickson, is addressing the National Press Club now, discussing the context behind Labor’s victory at the federal election. Erickson credits Anthony Albanese’s offering of a “better future” as opposed to three more years of Scott Morrison as the “powerful argument” that secured the party victory. Labor won the election because we talked about the future and we offered the country an alternative to more of the same. After two years of Covid ... and nearly a decade of Coalition neglect, Labor offered Australians the chance to elect a prime minister who would show up, who would take responsibility and would work with people to solve problems – an opportunity that Australians took. The biggest barrier Labor had to overcome was not voters’ evaluation of our proposition or a counter offer from the Coalition. It was a widespread and deep sense of fatigue, anxiety and aversion to risk after some of the most difficult years that we have endured. Normally these sentiments would drive fence sitters decisively back to the government of the day and weigh heavily against an effort to build a majority for change. Yet we had a powerful argument – we assert that the alternatives of this election were not the devil you know or a leap into the unknown, instead it was a clear choice between a better future under Anthony Albanese or three more years of a Morrison government. In the 18 months leading up to polling day, the Coalition refused to talk about the future and refused to put forward anything resembling a positive case for their own re-election. Victorian government confident it has enough power supply Senior Victorian minister Jacinta Allan told reporters earlier today the state was not in danger of any blackouts, saying it has sufficient energy supply and that it has no plans to change its position on the permanent ban on coal seam gas exploration. There is undoubtedly pressure on our energy supply but the advice from Aemo is that Victoria has adequate power supply. Bowen is followed by the minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, who takes credit for the increase to the minimum wage, and blasts the former government for not pushing for an increase earlier: The era of wages being kept deliberately low by the Liberal and National parties effectively came to an end today. It came to an end for people on the minimum wage. It came to an end for cleaners, for shop assistants, for people in the care economy. A wage increase that the Liberal and National Party never would have advocated for. People will be seeing in their bank accounts what the change of government means. People will be seeing in their bank accounts a wage increase that never would have happened back when we had a government committed and determined to keep wages deliberately low. For the first time in nearly a decade, we’ve had a government argue for a real wage increase and now it’ll be delivered. Chris Bowen says energy system ‘under pressure’ Next up is the energy minister, Chris Bowen, who says he is so far pleased that the country has avoided blackouts, but says the system is under “pressure” and that the government supports Aemo to manage the situation: I’m very pleased that we have been able to avoid so far any significant load shedding events or of course blackouts. I am also pleased that Aemo advises me that that will likely continue to be the case, that we will be able to avoid any load shedding events or any blackouts. Of course that is subjected to any unexpected outages in the system. As I’ve said repeatedly this week, the system is under pressure. We have administered pricing (controls) in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria and that is leading to market outcomes which are requiring Aemo to intervene very heavily into the market. And yesterday, Aemo directed more than 5,000 megawatts into the market using their powers. They directed generators to bid into the market and to generate more than 5,000 megawatts across the national energy market. As I said, Aemo advises that the situation continues to remain that load shedding and blackouts are unlikely, but continues under very active management. I’ve made clear to Aemo that the government supports any action they choose to take to effectively manage the situation in the best interests of Australian consumers, whether they be big industrial consumers or residential consumers. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has welcomed the Fair Work Commission’s increase to the minimum wage, and referenced a key moment from the election campaign: At the heart of the election campaign, I was asked whether I would welcome a decision by the Fair Work Commission to increase the minimum wage by just $1. And today, they have done just that. And when I was asked, Would I welcome a decision? I said, Absolutely. And I absolutely welcome today’s decision of a 5.2% increase granted by the Fair Work Commission to all those who are on the minimum wage. That lifts the minimum wage up by just $1.05 an hour or $40 a week. It makes a difference to people who are struggling with the cost of living. The Fair Work Commission, having assessed the impact on the economy, having made an assessment based upon all the submissions, has chosen 5.2% – which is why we didn’t put a precise figure on it. We just said we didn’t want people to go backwards, and I welcome that. The truth is that many of those people who are on the minimum wage are the heroes who saw us through the pandemic. These workers deserve more than our thanks, they deserve a pay rise and today they’ve got it. The prime minister Anthony Albanese has just stepped up for a press conference. Aemo warns of power shortfalls in South Australia The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued a warning for South Australia, where power shortfalls are being anticipated in a few days time. In a statement, the Aemo says people in South Australia could see interruptions to their power on Friday morning and evening. From 8am to 9.30am on Friday, the maximum load forecast to be interrupted is 359 megawatts, while from 5pm to 9.30pm that evening the maximum load forecast to be interrupted is 382 megawatts. Aemo has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an Aemo intervention event. Aemo is seeking a market response. The federal court has approved US private equity group Blackstone’s takeover of Crown Resorts, paving the way for the troubled casino group to de-list from the stock exchange. Justice Stewart Anderson gave the takeover scheme approval after a brief hearing this morning. It’s not quite right to say he rubber-stamped the deal – these days, the court’s seal is applied digitally. The pathway to the courthouse was cleared over the past week when state-based gambling regulators approved Blackstone as a fit and proper operator of the casinos they oversee. Blackstone is now able to pay shareholders, including James Packer, for their stakes in the company and take full control. You can expect it to be de-listed from the ASX quite quickly. The takeover comes after a torrid period for Crown, with multiple inquiries into allegations of money laundering and links between the junket operators who brought in high-rolling gamblers and organised crime, sparked by a 2019 expose in Nine Entertainment’s newspapers and on its flagship current affairs show, 60 Minutes. Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and junket operators were indeed linked to organised crime, the first of the inquiries, in NSW, found. Woolworths has announced it will freeze the prices of some essential items until the end of the year to help customers struggling with the increased cost of living. The retail giant has decided to freeze the prices of flour, sugar, canned tomatoes, frozen peas, chicken tenders, laundry powder and dishwashing liquid. In an email that will be circulated among customers on Thursday, Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said: We know this is a significant portion of weekly household budgets. As we all lean into the challenges of inflation, rest assured the whole team at Woolworths is committed to making sure you can always Get your Woolies worth. The Australian Electoral Commission says it will not conduct a recount in the federal seat of Gilmore, after Liberal candidate Andrew Constance requested one yesterday. “I can confirm that a recount will not be directed. The request was considered carefully,” an AEC spokesperson said. The counting process was undertaken in line with the Electoral Act and there was sufficient checking and re-checking of ballot papers during the scrutiny period (including the fresh scrutiny process). The declaration of the poll for Gilmore is being reset with a time and location to be updated on the AEC’s website shortly. Constance said his scrutineers in the ultra-marginal seat had “raised concerns in relation to certain aspects of the process, particularly the scrutiny of informal votes”, claiming there were “strong grounds for a recount” considering the close result. Constance came up just short, recording a 2.44% swing but ending up behind Labor on a two-party margin of 50.17–49.83, according to the AEC’s official results. The Labor MP Fiona Phillips was due to be declared the winner in Gilmore on the NSW south coast at 2pm on Tuesday, but the declaration was delayed due to the request. The AEC said on Wednesday it would officially declare the result in Gilmore at a date soon to be confirmed. Phillips welcomed the news in a tweet, saying “Andrew Constance’s application for a recount in Gilmore has been denied”. We’ve reached out to Constance for comment. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is heading to Solomon Islands this week – the first trip to the country since it signed a security deal with China. It was announced yesterday that Wong would be heading to New Zealand for meetings with her counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, tomorrow. And Wong has just announced that she will then head to Solomon Islands on Friday: On Friday, I will visit Solomon Islands, where I will meet Prime Minister the Hon Manasseh Sogavare and a number of his Cabinet ministers. I also look forward to engaging with the local community, including women leaders. We are committed to deepening our cooperation with Solomon Islands, as we work together to face shared challenges and achieve our shared goals, including on climate change. I look forward to discussing the ways we can continue to make progress on pandemic recovery, economic development and labour mobility priorities, and addressing our shared security interests. This will be Wong’s third trip to the Pacific since being sworn in last month. Wong also said her statement that New Zealand was “an indispensable partner in our ambitions for a stronger Pacific family”. Wong said she and Mahuta would “consider ways we can work together, to make the most of the new energy and resources the Australian Government is bringing to the Pacific”. Wong said there were “new possibilities for collaboration with New Zealand in support of regional security and on climate change” and she looked forward to “drawing on New Zealand’s experiences as Australia develops a First Nations foreign policy” Aged care sector welcomes wage rise but urges federal government to lift funding The aged care sector has welcomed today’s minimum wage increase, but has warned it needs a funding increase from the federal government to help struggling providers remain viable. Industry peak body Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association said it was clear that aged care workers needed a “significant” pay increase. But the association’s interim chief executive Paul Sadler said that without additional government support, aged care providers would continue to face an impossible choice between investing in quality and finding savings to keep the doors open. A significant wage increase for our workforce is essential to attract new people and improve quality of care to older Australians, but when two-thirds of providers are already running at a loss year-on-year, we need the wage increase to be funded by the federal government. Separate from this morning’s case, the Fair Work Commission is also exploring aged care pay through its aged care work value case, which Labor promised to fully fund if it won government. But that aged care work value case is unlikely to conclude until early next year. In its findings, the aged care royal commission said the government’s current funding indexation process was inadequate, and had failed to keep up with the increased costs faced by providers. The royal commission recommended that short-term indexation changes be made to improve funding levels in the next few years, until a new independent pricing process, designed to advise government on the cost of aged care services, can begin its work. That recommendation was not accepted by the previous government. Sadler said: If we don’t see urgent action the aged care workforce crisis is simply going to translate into other serious problems like increased closures, or offsets in other areas such as training or investment in facilities. Ai Group says wage rise will ‘add fuel to the inflation fire’ Reactions to the Fair Work Commission’s decision continue to pour in, with the head of the national industry association Ai Group saying the increase will “add fuel to the inflation fire”. Innes Willox, chief executive of Ai Group, said the minimum wage increase could increase inflation and lead to even higher interest rates: There is a major risk that the 5.2% per cent increase that has been awarded to the National Minimum Wage, with increases of between 4.6% and 5.2% to award rates, will fuel inflation and lead to even higher interest rates; even more hardship for people with mortgages, personal loans or credit card debts; and add substantially to the risk of unemployment and underemployment - particularly for unskilled employees. The cost increase will be difficult to absorb for businesses that are already struggling to cope with big increases in material and energy costs, interest rate rises, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Andrew McKellar, has responded to the minimum wage decision, warning it is a “risk to the economy” and would add $7.9bn to employers’ costs. But even more interesting than the usual complaints about costs was McKellar’s proposal to excise 2.5 million award-reliant workers from the annual wage review, leaving it for the 180,000 lowest paid workers on the national minimum wage. McKellar told reporters in Canberra: What this highlights is that frankly this national wage case process, the way it feeds into the modern awards, it’s an antiquated process, it’s a process that’s had its day, it’s not compatible with the internationally competitive economy that needs to operate in a flexible way and responding to the circumstances, the competitive challenges and need to drive productivity. Asked what the alternative is, he said: You must have [centralised wage fixing] for minimum wages, fine, for the 180,000 people on the lowest wage safety net. But when it flows through to the modern award system it needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. We need to get back to much more effective enterprising bargaining, flexible wage setting driven by the market. This proposal is interesting. It either means that the Fair Work Commission should run separate reviews of minimums in awards on a case-by-base basis, or, that if you’re on an award and want a pay rise you should turn to enterprise bargaining with your employer. McKellar didn’t clarify the comments after the press conference, but reiterated that the “one size fits all” approach of one wage case deciding the pay of 2.6 million workers “isn’t flexible” and alternatives should be on the agenda at the Albanese government’s employment summit. Consumer sentiment plunges towards historic low, Westpac survey says As today’s 5.2% minimum wage increase decision by the Fair Work Commission ripples through the economy, Westpac and the Melbourne Institute have released their latest consumer sentiment survey that points to ongoing falls. Bill Evans, Westpac’s chief economist, said the 4.5% drop in the index to 86.4 took the gauge towards historic low. It followed the Reserve Bank’s decision last week to hike the cash rate by 50 basis points to 0.85%. “This read is even weaker than we had expected,” Evans said. “Over the 46-year history of the survey, we have only seen Index reads at or below this level during major economic dislocations. “The record lows have been during COVID-19 (75.6); the Global Financial Crisis (79.0); early 1990s recession (64.6); the mid-1980s slowdown (78.7) and the early 1980s recession (75.5),” he said. “Those last three episodes were associated with high inflation; rising interest rates; and a contracting economy – a mix that may be threatening to repeat.” Also worrying is the drop in homebuyer interest, which is close to the lowest in more than a decade, during the GFC. If sentiment is dimming now, though, imagine what it will look like if investors are right about the near-term future track for the RBA’s cash rate. If the 1.5% rate by 5 July is right, the 65 basis point increase would be the most by the RBA since 1994. National wage case process ‘antiquated’, chamber of commerce head says McKellar has gone on to call the national wage case process “antiquated” when asked if he is concerned about future pay rises: It certainly adds to that pressure at a time when labour is intensely difficult to access. We are seeing record levels of vacancies out there in the work place at the moment. One of the things that this decision highlights, and the commission has tried to really nuance, it is a very complicated decision and there is a number of different elements to it. What this highlights is that, frankly, this national wage case process, the way it feeds into the modern awards, it is an antiquated process. It is a process that’s had its day, it is not compatible with the needs of a modern internationally competitive economy that needs to be operating in a flexible way and responding to the circumstances. Chamber of commerce boss says wages should be flexible and ‘driven by the market’ So, what does chamber of commerce boss McKellar propose as an alternative? For minimum wages, fine, that is the 180,000 people on the lowest wages, the wage safety net. When it flows through into the modern award system, this needs to be looked at on a case by case basis. We need to get back to much more effective enterprise bargaining, flexible wage settings, driven by the market. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry laments minimum wage increase Now we are jumping into a press conference with the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, who says the increase to minimum wage is a “significant risk” to economy: It veers very much towards the upper end of the range of possible outcomes that we could have expected to have seen today. In particular, this adds very significant costs to the Australian economy and to business. By our calculation, this will add $7.9bn in costs to the affected businesses over the year ahead, so that will be a very considerable burden that those businesses will either have to take to the bottom line, or pass onto their customers. It comes at a time when inflation is emerging as one of the most urgent challenges facing the Australian economy and if we are to address that, if we are to remain competitive, then, clearly, this is not a decision that will help in those circumstances. ‘People will actually be able to buy the food they need for their families’: McManus McManus is next asked what difference the wage increase will have for households on minimum wage: For a household on minimum wages, we are talking about an extra $40 a week. That is going to make a significant difference. If you consider the basics. If you are are on the minimum, all of your wage is spent on the basics. Your grocery bills, your rent, that is your transport costs and your energy costs. That amount per week is going to mean that people will actually be able to buy the food they need for their families as opposed to having to cut back on that. McManus: ‘We have always been very mindful of not adding to inflation’ McManus is asked whether the increase will stand the test of time, especially with inflation set to reach 7%. Will another wage crisis hit again? We were always concerned about what future inflation would be and this moved around the whole time of this annual wage review. It was only yesterday that the reserve bank governor said he thinks inflation will get to around 7% around Christmas. That is halfway through the pay increase. We were mindful of that problem which is why we were asking for a 5.5% increase and we thought that was reasonable. We don’t know what is going to happen into the future, in terms of inflation, whether or not it is a spike that will quickly come off or whether or not it is going to be something that continues longer than a year. If it continues longer than a year, obviously, we will need to make sure workers do get pay rises that mean they keep their heads above water. We have always been very mindful of not adding to inflation, that is why we have never asked for a pay increase that is more than inflation and productivity. We think it is going to make a significant difference to the pressures that low-paid workers are under with cost of living rising. The union movement fought so hard for this increase across pretty heavy cross winds. We also had to oppose what the employers were arguing for which was very significant real wage cuts at a time when their profits are up 20% and productivity is up as well as unemployment being low. This decision is one that is reasonable and it is fair. It means that for low-paid workers like Jordan who is with me, he will have a better ability to pay rent and pay for the groceries and to pay for energy bills as well. The union movement is happy and proud that we have fought for this increase and that it is going to make a big difference for so many workers. Fair Work boss says rise will not have significant negative impact on economy Ross continued, saying the approach of the commission was one balanced between the needs to address the difficulties faced by people on low wages, with the needs of the economy: We accept that the approach we have adopted will result in, albeit minor, compression in relativities. But that consideration is to be balanced against the need to provide greater relief to low-paid workers in the context of rising cost of living pressures. Given the current strength of the labour market, the adjustments we propose to make will not have a significant adverse effect on the performance and competitiveness of the national economy. Some award employees will still have a real wage cut despite rise, Ross says Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross: In our view, awarding an increase in modern award minimum wages of the magnitude proposed by ACCER, some 6.5%, and the ACTU - 5.5%, would, in the present economic circumstances, pose a real risk of significant adverse effects to the national economy. We acknowledge that the increases we have determined will mean a real wage cut for some award reliant employees. This is an issue that can be addressed in subsequent reviews. Minimum wage rise delayed until October for aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross has revealed the increase in the minimum wage will be delayed to 1 October in the aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. Ross said: Absent exceptional circumstances, the Act provides the variations to a national minimum wage order and to modern award minimum wages are to operate from 1 July in the financial year following the review we are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, such as the warranty or delayed operative date for certain modern awards. These awards are in the aviation tourism and hospitality sector. The variation determinations in respect of [those] modern awards ... will come into operation on 1 October 2022. In respect of the remaining modern awards, We have not been persuaded that there are exceptional circumstances, such as to warrant a delayed operative date in the variation determinations arising from this review. The Fair Work Commission has ordered the national minimum wage to increase by 5.2%, lifting the national minimum wage from $20.33 to $21.38 an hour. That is a $40 per week increase. Modern award minimum rates will go up 4.6% “subject to a minimum increase of $40 per week”. Justice Iain Ross: In effect, modern award minimum wage rates above $869.60 per week will receive a 4.6% adjustments wage rates below that level will be adjusted by $40 per week. The decision sets the pay of at least 2.7m workers on the national minimum or award minimum wages. Ross said the “most significant changes” since last year’s decision was “a sharp increase in the cost of living and the strengthening of the labour market”. He noted the low-paid are “particularly vulnerable” to high inflation, which “erodes the real value of workers wages”. Ross said: At the aggregate level, labor market performance has been particularly strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% compared to 5.5% in April 2021. At the time of the last review, measures of underemployment have also fallen. The improvement in the labor market is forecast to continue in the period ahead. There has also been a sharp rise in the cost of living since last year’s review at the time of last year’s decision, the consumer price index and the underlying measure of inflation. Both stood at 1.1%. The comparable figures now standard 5.1% for the CPI and 3.7% for the trimmed mean or the underlying inflation rate. There is also a marked difference in the inflation forecasts. Ross said these figures weigh in favour of a higher increase, because employers’ groups’ calls for a moderate increase of about 2.5% would result in real pay cuts. Fair Work Commission handing down decision on minimum wage The president of the Fair Work Commission Iain Ross has been speaking now, laying out the context behind the decision he will (soon) announce: The key differences in economic indicators between last year and this year are set out in table four in our decision. The most significant changes since last year’s review decision have been the sharp increase in the cost of living and the strengthening of the labour market. At the aggregate level, labour market performance has been particularly strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9%. Compared to 5.5% in April 2021, at the time of the last review. The improvement in the labour market is forecast to continue in the period ahead. There has also been a sharp rise in the cost of living since last year’s review. At the time of last year’s decision, the consumer price index and the underlying measure of inflation both stood at 1.1%. The comparable figures now stand at 5.1% for the CPI and 3.7% for the trimmed mean, or the underlying inflation rate. There is also a marked difference in the inflation forecasts. The Australian Energy Market Operator has taken a little time this morning to update its forecast electricity shortfalls. The aim is to highlight the gap and then nudge the generators to fill it. Here’s the one for Queensland, a so-called level 3 “lack of reserve” notice. NSW is forecast – for now, at least – to have a bigger gap, also in the evening: There are a bunch of other LoR’s, although they are at level 1 and 2. These include Victoria and South Australia, so we’ll be keeping a beady eye on those too. Brisbane property owners who list their homes as short-term accommodation will face a 50% increase in rates amid the state’s housing crisis. The announcement is expected to come on Wednesday as the lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, hands down the Liberal National party’s $4bn budget. Schrinner told ABC Radio Brisbane the council wants homeowners to put their properties back into the long-term rental market rather than listing them on sites such as Airbnb. What we see is renters are being affected with rents going up significantly, and then those that are wanting to get a rental property are having real difficulty at the moment getting access to anything. If owners had these properties in the market for short-term, overnight stays – that is their choice, but what they’ll be facing now is a 50% increase in their rates. Schrinner said the rate hike will not affect owners who only rent out a single room, granny flat or shared accommodation. Another day of monitoring energy flows within and between states. One thing, though, needs to be cleared up. The Australia Energy Regulator, along with other members of the Energy Security Board, will be meeting with generators to discuss the strained market. Energy ministers are NOT expected to take part, an AER spokesperson has just clarified with the Guardian. (Clare Savage, AER’s chair, made comments on radio this morning which may have implied ministers would be tuning in, but that’s not the case – for now at least.) Meanwhile, in the market itself, there are no updates yet of the status of level 3 lack of reserve warnings for each of the five states within the National Electricity Market from the Australian Energy Markets Operator. First thing this morning, Aemo said it had “successfully directed generators, which hadn’t bid into the market, to be available”. In another hint of the arm-twisting going on, the regulator said today: Today, AEMO continues to encourage generators across the NEM through our lack of reserve (LOR) notices in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to bid their availability into the market, rather than being directed to do so. (The underlining was in the original statement, to underscore the point, presumably.) Anyway, ahead of today’s regulators and generators’ meeting Electrical Trades Union has blasted “10 years of regulatory neglect” and called for an immediate review of the regulatory frameworks that make up the Nem. ETU’s Queensland state secretary Peter Ong said “these warnings of blackouts and supply shortages are symptomatic of private energy companies gaming a system that has for years had plenty of acronyms and boards but very little actual regulation”. (He’s right they do have a lot of acronyms.) Ong said: Australia is one of the world’s leading coal and gas producers, yet we have the absurd situation where we are held to ransom by multinational, tax-avoiding, gas companies who export massive amounts of gas at exorbitant prices while withholding supply to maximise profit in eastern Australia. While we also have coal companies exporting large quantities overseas rather than providing it to generate power. We urge [Queensland energy minister Mick] de Brenni to call on the federal government to undertake an immediate review of Australia’s broken National Electricity Market that is responsible for this ongoing crisis. Secondly, we call on the state government to use the upcoming budget and energy lan to accelerate construction of public-owned renewable generation and storage assets. Victoria is reporting 8,687 new Covid cases and 18 deaths: The AAP is reporting former Victorian senator Derryn Hinch has announced his plans to run in the November state election. The 78-year-old founder of Derryn Hinch’s Justice party confirmed the news on Twitter on Tuesday night. “Yes ... it is true,” Hinch tweeted in response to a question about his run. He is eyeing a seat in the Victorian Upper House after failing to return to the federal Senate last month. His party currently holds two seats in the upper house and he will nominate for the Southern Metropolitan Region. Quick note: NSW is reporting 7,260 new Covid cases and 14 deaths this morning. In what I assume will be an ongoing theme for the day, Clare Savage, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, has refuted claims the price cap is to blame for generators choosing to withhold energy from the grid. Savage was on ABC Radio Melbourne and said she would meet with generators today to encourage them to bid to market if they have generation available. There is a process to make sure that generators can recover their costs. I don’t think that’s an excuse. If generators have supply available they need to be bidding it into the market. They will receive the $300 which is the price cap and if they have costs in excess of that, they will be recovered. Savage conceded that the regulator would consider lifting the cap beyond 300 megawatts per hour, but added it was no excuse for generators not to bid. She also said the volatility of the wholesale market would not likely affect consumers. I think it’s really important to distinguish between what is a wholesale market. There’s a lot of difficulty in the wholesale market right now … but retail customers are largely protected from that. Bill Shorten to highlight wider economic benefits of NDIS NDIS minister Bill Shorten will today address the Where to From Here? national disability conference, with the Sydney Morning Herald reporting he will announce his focus will be to “improve the effectiveness of the NDIS”. Shorten says there is “significant” opportunities to improve the system, with an eye on employment outcomes, adding that people usually take “a narrow view of sustainability.” If the NDIS is effective, there’s a huge return on our investment in years to come. Not only does this return include stronger meaningful social and economic connections for people with disabilities, there’s also a financial return to governments ... including reducing health, employment, social security, housing and justice costs. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has told ABC News energy producers are “gaming the system”, adding that Australia was being “held hostage” due to a “broken” system. Hanson-Young called for a greater government response to reform regulations, which she implied were being manipulated by corporations that are holding energy supply to profit from schemes encouraging them to produce more energy. It’s quite clear that the rules are broken, the market is broken. This whole system needs to be reviewed. They’re effectively … withholding supply, waiting for the energy agency to beg them to bid into the market, only then to get more money through compensation. This is highway robbery by these big corporations, and it’s time they were pulled into line. It’s polluting, it’s dirty fuel that’s getting increasingly expensive, most of it is foreign-owned, the profits go overseas, and they don’t pay too much tax. Australians are sick of it. South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas is urging the federal government to intervene in the energy crisis gripping the east coast, saying the situation is a result of a “market failure on a grand scale”. Malinauskas was speaking to the ABC and said his government were investing $600m into a hydrogen power plant to ensure the state has a “stable and secure” energy source. We are witnessing market failure on a grand scale … across the national electricity market in a way that I think a range of policymakers should be deeply ashamed of. We are in a first-world country that is energy rich, and the fact we’ve now got Australians being told to turn porch lights off to keep the system going, I think that is somewhat of an embarrassment. Last night the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, was on the ABC’s 7.30 giving a rare insight into his thinking. Lowe said he was determined to ensure inflation is returned to 2-3%, while warning it might reach 7% by the end of the year, well above the 6% forecast by the bank only a couple of weeks ago. We’ll do what’s necessary to get inflation back to 2-3%. It’s unclear at the moment how far interest rates will need to go up to get that. I think by the end of the year inflation will get too close to 7%, and we need to chart a course to bring it back down. Lowe stressed that interest rates had been at “emergency levels” in response to the pandemic, and that the situation needed to “gradually return to normal”. I say that because the midpoint of our inflation target is 2.5%, so an interest rate of 2.5% in inflation-adjusted terms is really an interest rate of zero, which in historical terms is a very low number. How fast we get to 2.5%, indeed whether we get to 2.5%, is going to be determined by events. Australian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara says the price cap might be “incentivising” generators to withhold power. McNamara was on RN Breakfast this morning and she blamed the price cap of $300 per megawatt hour – which she said is “significantly below” the wholesale cost of electricity for most generators – for the energy crisis. Some generators have responded by preferring in some cases to withdraw supply and wait to be directed on the market operator. There is sufficient capacity in the market but the situation is tight. The price has the effect of incentivising some generators to sit on the sidelines and await direction from the market. That’s because those generators are being squeezed between the price cap and their high input costs. Now, either way, because we’re in an administered pricing situation, there is a compensation regime available, and the industry is in conversations with the regulator and the market operator about how these things work. But the truth is, we’re in a unique situation, and we’re deep in the weeds of market rules that hadn’t been engaged with before by many of the market participants. So it’s really an unprecedented set of circumstances . Mask mandates are set to be eased in airport terminals across Australia after health officials found the rule was “no longer proportionate”, just days before Anthony Albanese meets with state and territory leaders. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) said in a statement issued late on Tuesday that it was proposing mask wearing in airport terminals “no longer be mandated” from as early as this Friday night: The AHPPC notes that all states and territories have relaxed mask mandates in most settings within the community and considers that it is no longer proportionate to mandate mask use in airport terminals. The AHPPC proposes that mask wearing in airport terminals no longer be mandated from as early as midnight 17 June 2022. Despite the proposal to no longer make them compulsory, the AHPPC said it “continues to strongly recommend continued mask wearing in airport terminals and other indoor settings, especially where physical distancing is not possible”. The body said masks minimised Covid-19 and influenza transmission and protected “those who are unable to get vaccinated and people who have a higher risk of developing severe illness”. The federal government responded to the new advice, saying it anticipated the travelling public would “notice this change in the days following Friday as individual state and territory jurisdictions make the necessary changes to their public health orders”. The health minister, Mark Butler, and the transport minister, Catherine King, thanked “the thousands of people who work in our airport terminals around Australia who have followed the rules to keep us safe” and “the travelling public for continuing to comply with the ongoing regulations”. The AHPPC brings together state, territory and federal chief medical and health officers. The prime minister is due to meet with state premiers and territory chief ministers at a national cabinet meeting on Friday. Good morning from bitterly cold Sydney, this is Mostafa Rachwani and I’ll be taking you through the news today. We begin with the Fair Work Commission, which will deliver its verdict on an increase to the minimum wage. The commission’s expert panel, headed by president Iain Ross, will announce its decision at 10am, after the new government backed a 5.1% increase, in line with inflation. Prime minister Anthony Albanese will be holding his first cabinet meeting in Queensland, in the manufacturing city of Gladstone, in a bid to reconnect with locals. The meeting will be paired with a lunchtime civic reception for local residents to ask questions of the MPs. Last night Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said in a rare interview that the RBA expects inflation to hit 7% by the end of the year, warning he’d “do what’s necessary” to keep inflation down. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on the energy crisis after each of the five states in the national electricity market (Nem) – from Queensland to Tasmania – had a forecast shortfall of electricity, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). Aemo has warned Victoria could next face blackouts this evening. We’ll keep you updated on that as well as everything else happening today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T15:52:10Z","webTitle":"UK energy security plan criticised as missed chance to reduce bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s energy security plan has been labelled a missed opportunity to bring down bills rapidly over its failure to fund energy efficiency upgrades or back onshore windfarms in the face of Tory backbench opposition. While the government’s plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been “held to ransom” by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan “inadequate”, warning it would do little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030. A leaked early draft of the energy plan proposed increasing onshore wind capacity from 15GW to 45GW but the target, first reported by the i newspaper, disappeared from the final edit. Energy executives are understood to have told the prime minister during a meeting last week that onshore turbines offered the cheapest and fastest way to wean the UK off gas, the price of which has rocketed further since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the government scrapped its initial target, apparently in response to fierce opposition from senior Tories including the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who called the turbines an “eyesore”. Instead, the government promised to offer a “limited” number of communities guaranteed lower electricity bills in exchange for supporting local windfarms. Miliband said this would do little to unblock planning restrictions that he said place a “unique burden” on onshore wind, which he claimed could have replaced Russian gas imports within 24 months. Under a moratorium implemented by David Cameron’s government in 2015, onshore windfarms in England require unanimous consent from local communities, meaning they can easily be blocked. “If one person objects, it doesn’t get built,” Miliband told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that it was easier to build an incinerator or a road in the face of local opposition. “The government has rejected the cheapest, lowest cost, most secure forms of power we have … including onshore wind.” Mark Worcester of the Turley planning consultancy said: “Some of the more immediate opportunities appear to have been missed.” Once an onshore windfarm has secured a contract to supply energy, it can be fully operational within about two years, compared with four or five for offshore projects, according to the trade body RenewableUK. Electricity from onshore wind is also about 20% cheaper than offshore, which is in turn cheaper than nuclear or gas. Miliband accused the government of shying away from onshore “not because of the national interest but because some Tory backbenchers said they didn’t want it to happen”. The energy security plan also came in for criticism for failing to map out a return to nationwide home energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled dramatically over the past decade. Since 2013, successive government cuts to support for insulation have reduced the number of installations from 2.3m to 10% of that number, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent advisory organisation. But the energy security plan contained no new measures to accelerate efficiency efforts, amid a row over cost between the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. One Whitehall source said the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been keen to use about £300m in departmental underspend from the past few years to kickstart a programme of mass home insulations. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with whom Kwarteng has previously clashed over financial support for businesses, is understood to have preferred not to commit funding to the plan. The climate thinktank E3G said the gaps in the energy security plan meant that little had been done to address consumers’ energy costs or abandon fossil fuels, including gas and oil imported from Russia. “This isn’t an energy security strategy and will do nothing to bring down energy bills. It is a national security threat and the person who will be happiest with it is Vladimir Putin.” Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, said the government had not “taken the opportunity to promote demand-side energy efficiency, including via insulation – which in turn will help reduce the most significant costs and support the push for net zero”. Greenpeace said the plans were “completely inadequate”, while the Association for Renewable Energy &amp; Clean Technology said the government had “failed to rise to the challenge facing the country”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/17/victoria-ignores-police-calls-for-offence-to-replace-public-drunkenness","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-17T00:01:44Z","webTitle":"Victoria to end public drunkenness laws with no new arrest powers for police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/17/victoria-ignores-police-calls-for-offence-to-replace-public-drunkenness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/17/victoria-ignores-police-calls-for-offence-to-replace-public-drunkenness","fields":{"bodyText":"The daughter of Tanya Day, who died in custody after being arrested for being drunk on a train, has welcomed a decision by the Victorian government not to replace the state’s public intoxication laws with new move-on powers, despite opposition from the police union. The government on Tuesday confirmed it would not give police any new powers to arrest people for being drunk in public once the existing offence is decriminalised in November 2023. The Police Association has argued it would be “negligent and reckless” to decriminalise public drunkenness without enacting other laws to “keep people safe”. However, Day’s daughter, Apryl Day, welcomed the government’s commitment not to replace public intoxication with police move-on powers. “It’s the first time across the nation that a jurisdiction has made a commitment to true decriminalisation, which I think is a really powerful moment,” she said. The government committed to repealing public drunkenness as a crime in 2019, amid the coronial inquest into the death of Day, but the implementation of a health-based response to replace the offence was delayed 12 months due to Covid-19. The 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman had fallen asleep on a train from Bendigo to Melbourne when she was arrested for public drunkenness and taken to a police station in Castlemaine. She hit her head at least five times in a holding cell while unattended and died in hospital from a brain haemorrhage about three weeks later. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Victoria’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, on Tuesday said the reform would not be “perfect” but would provide the “best outcome for the most amount of people”. “The main reason to decriminalise public intoxication is to ensure that people who are drunk aren’t sobering up in police cells,” she said. “We know that there’s a disproportionate impact on our Aboriginal community. “We have Aboriginal people who are arrested for the sole offence of being drunk in public and that is causing immense trauma and in some instances we know has resulted in people dying.” The Police Association secretary, Wayne Gatt, said no other state or territory that has decriminalised public drunkenness has taken such a “cavalier approach with the safety of its community”. “Decriminalising public drunkenness, of itself, is not a dangerous reform,” Gatt said in a statement. “What is dangerous however, is to do so without maintaining the safety net that would provide police with a means to manage people in the community that do not consent to a health response or where a health response is simply not available.” The opposition spokesperson for police and criminal justice reform, Brad Battin, agreed police must retain move-on powers to protect community safety. “We’ve seen too often on the front page of the papers a coward punch, generally from someone who is intoxicated, and we hear about it in court after they were drunk at the time and didn’t know what they were doing,” he said. However, Symes stressed the reform would not dilute further police’s powers. “Police will still have the option of stepping in when somebody is disturbing the peace, causing a scene or concerns about violent behaviour,” she said. Day dismissed the police union’s comments, saying police were yet to acknowledge the role they played in her mother’s death. The Victorian coroner in 2020 concluded police officers had failed to adequately check Tanya Day’s safety and wellbeing, finding an indictable offence may have been committed. No charges have been laid over the death. “They actually have more of a care factor around their police powers being stripped than they do the lives of Aboriginal people and the deaths in custody that are occurring within Victoria,” Day said. Victoria and Queensland are the only jurisdictions in Australia to still have a specific offence for public drunkenness, which the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody found had disproportionately affected Indigenous people, and recommended that it be abolished. Of the 99 deaths investigated in the commission, 35% involved Aboriginal people who were detained in relation to public intoxication. Public drunkenness laws were repealed in NSW in 1979, but were effectively rolled into the state’s move-on laws. Symes said Victoria had learned from other jurisdictions that creating backup powers “undermines the whole purpose of decriminalisation.” The chief executive at the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Nerita Waight, said about 30 to 40 Aboriginal people a month continue to be arrested in the state for being drunk in public. She said the government’s decision to ensure police will not have new powers to respond to public intoxication is the “right” one and will have “a huge positive impact for overpoliced Aboriginal communities as well as other vulnerable communities across Victoria”. Danny Hill, secretary of the Victorian ambulance union, welcomed the creation ofsobering-up centres with associated transport teams but said more clarity was needed on the responsibilities of paramedics when dealing with an intoxicated person in future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/yakama-nation-nuclear-waste-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear waste ravaged their land. The Yakama Nation is on a quest to rescue it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/yakama-nation-nuclear-waste-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/yakama-nation-nuclear-waste-cleanup","fields":{"bodyText":"Trina Sherwood gazes out at the Hanford nuclear site as she speeds across the Columbia river in a small motorboat. More than 500 sq miles large and ringed by rocky mountains, the decommissioned nuclear production site is considered one of the most contaminated places in North America. It also sits on the ancestral lands of the Yakama Nation and other Indigenous peoples in Washington state. Here, precious wildlife, vision quest sites and burial grounds lie side-by-side with signs reading “warning hazardous area” and towering nuclear reactors, some of which date back to the second world war. There’s Gable Mountain, where young men would fast and pray, explained Sherwood, a cultural specialist for the Yakama Nation’s Environmental Restoration/Waste Management (ER/WM) program. There’s Locke Island, where an Indigenous village once stood, and the towering White Bluffs, where Native people collected white paint for ceremonies. There are also outcroppings of tules, which were used to make mats for ceremonies and tipis, as well as yarrow root, which was known to treat burns. The Hanford nuclear site was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project, and over the next four decades produced nearly two-thirds of the plutonium for the US’s nuclear weapons supply, including the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. During its lifespan, hundreds of billions of gallons of liquid waste were dumped in underground storage tanks or simply straight into the ground. After the site’s nine nuclear reactors were shut down by 1987, about 56m gallons of radioactive waste were left behind in 177 large underground tanks – two of which are currently leaking – alongside a deeply scarred landscape. In the decades since, the Yakama Nation has been one of four local Indigenous communities dedicated to the cleanup of this historic landscape. For the Yakama Nation, that has meant tireless environmental and cultural oversight, advocacy and outreach with the hope that one day the site will be restored to its natural state, opening the doors to a long-awaited, unencumbered homecoming. Today, their outreach work has reached a fever pitch. There are few Yakama Nation elders still alive who remember the area before its transformation, and there are likely decades to go before cleanup is complete. So members are racing to pass on the site’s history to the next generation, in the hopes they can one day take over. “Our elders are leaving that have that historical knowledge; people that actually lived there during that time and can tell you stories about the area,” said Laurene Contreras, administrator for ER/WM, the program responsible for the Yakama Nation’s Hanford work. “That’s why it’s so important for us to make sure that we’re carrying that message forward.” ‘Religious and moral duty’ Yakama Nation history on the Hanford site dates back to pre-colonization, when people would spend the winter here fishing for sturgeon, salmon and lamprey in the Columbia River, as well as gathering and trading with other families. In 1855, the Nation ceded over 11m acres of land to the US, which included the Hanford area, and signed a treaty that relegated them to a reservation while allowing the right to continue fishing, hunting, and gathering roots and berries at “all usual and accustomed places”. But in the 1940’s, the situation shifted dramatically when the area was cleared out to make room for the construction of nuclear reactors. LaRena Sohappy, 83, vice-chairwoman for Yakama Nation General Council, whose father was a well-known medicine man, grew up in Wapato, about 40 miles from Hanford. She said she remembers the strawberry fields that lined the Hanford site, her family gathering Skolkol, a root and daily food, and traveling to the area for ceremonies. Her cousin’s family who lived close to Hanford were woken in the middle of the night and forced to leave to make way for the nuclear site, she recalled “They didn’t have time to pack up anything,” said Sohappy. “They just had to leave and they were never told why and how long they were going to be gone.” The effort to give Indigenous people a voice in Hanford’s fate was forged in part by Russell Jim, a member of Yakama Nation’s council, whose work has been credited with helping to keep Hanford from becoming a permanent “deep geologic repository”, a place where high-level nuclear waste from this site and others across the country would be stored. “From time immemorial we have known a special relationship with Mother Earth,” Jim, who died in 2018, said in a statement to the US Senate in 1980. “We have a religious and moral duty to help protect Mother Earth from acts which may be a detriment to generations of all mankind.” Today, the ER/WM program, which was founded in the early 1980’s with Jim at the helm, includes such staff as a biologist, ecologist and archeologist. It’s funded by the US Department of Energy (DoE), which operates the Hanford site and leads the cleanup process under an agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington state department of ecology. The Yakama Nation program’s focus is on accelerating a thorough cleanup of the site, protecting culturally significant resources and assessing the threats to wildlife and water. The area around Hanford is considered the last free-flowing section of the Columbia River. There’s a major spawning site for Chinook salmon, and all along this section of the waterway, sturgeon live all year round, explained Phil Rigdon, Yakama Nation acting Tribal Administrative Director. “Our people, we’re fish people, we’re salmon people in the Columbia River … So for us, that was a priority,” he said. Chemicals including mercury, which can damage the brain, kidneys and heart, and PCBs, which can cause cancer, have been found in the river and could be ingested when eating fish, according to a 2017 advisory. For the Hanford Reach, a 150-mile section of the river that runs through Hanford, it suggests limiting consuming some fish to four or fewer times a month. In the past decade, it was also discovered that hundreds of gallons of highly radioactive waste have been leaking from two Hanford tanks, threatening the Columbia River. McClure Tosch, a Natural Resource Injury Assessment lead for ER/WM, said recently Yakama Nation has played a key role in developing a plan for the EPA to monitor the basin, including fish tissue. ER/WM has also been advocating for the federal government to test the wells at Hanford near the Columbia River for PFAS, long-lasting chemicals that can be found in an array of commercial and industrial products. If found, Tosch said, that could be a huge concern for the local drinking water. The energy department said in a statement: “Information-gathering about the occurrence and use of PFAS at DoE sites is ongoing”. There has also been a focus by the Yakama Nation to preserve culturally significant plants. Most recently, Sherwood has been overseeing the protection of a bright yellow plant known as Umtanum desert buckwheat. It has long been known as a medicinal plant for the local Indigenous people, and today, Hanford is the only place in the world where it is documented as growing. A ‘push and pull’ effect Despite the sometimes glacial nature of the federal government’s work, the Yakama Nation have scored some important wins. Recently, the ER/WM succeeded in amending a cleanup proposal for an area next to the Columbia River containing nuclear reactors, ensuring it will include a review of the impact on local aquatic insects. And in the coming months, Tosch says the tribe will work with the federal government to assess the effectiveness of a polyphosphate injection to sequester uranium found in Hanford’s groundwater; an approach the tribe has questioned. ER/WM staff have also pushed back against a federal government change in how high-level radioactive waste is classified, which could downgrade some of Hanford’s waste, ultimately preventing it from being removed from the site as expected. The energy department said they don’t plan to move forward with this new interpretation without first meeting with local Indigenous Nations. For their part, both DoE and EPA said their representatives meet with Yakama Nation regularly about Hanford and have benefitted from their’s and other local Indigenous Nations’ expertise and input. But Brian Stickney, DoE’s deputy manager for the Hanford Site, said in a statement that while Yakama Nation wants to see the lands returned to a pre-nuclear state, DoE is focused on regulatory requirements and protecting treaty rights. The Washington state department of ecology, which helps to oversee the Hanford cleanup and whose officials meet with the Yakama Nation at least once a month, described their relationship with the tribal Nation as a bit “push and pull”. “We are the regulators, and sometimes Yakama Nation would like us to push a little harder than they perceive us doing,” said Laura Watson, its director. “And so there’s a little bit of that push and pull. And that’s fine, that’s actually important as a regulator to have folks pushing.” ‘For our children not yet born’ A fully rehabilitated Hanford site likely won’t happen within the lifetime of Yakama Nation’s elders, or even the generation that follows. So, they’re working diligently to bring in younger tribal members to the effort. In recent years, they’ve held coloring contests, a mass postcard mailing campaign and visited local schools, explained Samantha Redheart, who coordinates Stem programs for ER/WM. They’ve also offered college scholarships for students studying such subjects as engineering and science in the hopes that the recipients may one day bring that knowledge back to the community. “We always share that Hanford is a multi-generational cleanup site,” she said. “Yakama Nation leaders and management are always looking into not just the cleanup today, but for our future generations and of our children that are not yet born.” 22 high school students were allowed to visit Hanford in 2016 - a rare opportunity, explains Redheart, as those under 16 are typically not allowed on most of the site. She said they took them to a series of culturally important sites, pointing out traditional cultural artifacts and salmon spawning grounds. But the experience was thoroughly regimented, involving energy department staff, hazmat guides and strict timelines. If Sohappy had her way, sharing her knowledge of Hanford before it was a nuclear site with the next generation would involve something of a trip back in time. She would take them on wagons and horses to each of the important sites, making sure to point out where the strawberry fields and old town once stood. It’s difficult to know whether that will ever be a reality. She herself hasn’t been to Hanford in over a decade. “It angers me that I can’t go where my dad used to wander around,” she says. “There’s nothing there that’s pleasurable. Not anymore anyway. It’s all torn up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/12/blue-jean-review-rosy-mcewen-is-riveting-in-powerful-section-28-drama-georgia-oakley","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-12T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"Blue Jean review – Rosy McEwen is riveting in powerful section 28 drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/12/blue-jean-review-rosy-mcewen-is-riveting-in-powerful-section-28-drama-georgia-oakley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/12/blue-jean-review-rosy-mcewen-is-riveting-in-powerful-section-28-drama-georgia-oakley","fields":{"bodyText":"Jean (Rosy McEwen) bleaches her gamine crop of hair in the bathroom while on the TV downstairs Blind Date plays out, host Cilla Black chortling her way through the smirky innuendo that passes for light entertainment. Jean smiles along with the studio audience laughter; it doesn’t occur to her to question the baked-in misogyny of the programme format. Not yet, at least. Jean is a woman caught in an uncomfortable limbo between two worlds. She’s a newly minted lesbian, on the fringes of a community of louder, prouder dykes, and in the first flush of romance with Viv (Kerrie Hayes). She’s also a PE teacher in a north-east England secondary school in the late 1980s; exactly the kind of person who the Thatcher regime’s recently enacted section 28 law – forbidding the “promotion of homosexuality” by local authorities – has in its crosshairs. For Jean – and McEwen’s performance is an intricate miracle of minute details and nervy flickers of alarm – the separation of work and life is an essential, but increasingly precarious, balance. That balance, to the frustration of Viv, who senses Jean’s reticence when it comes to fully embracing her sexual identity, is upended when one of her students, Lois (Lucy Halliday), encroaches on Jean’s closely guarded world. A supremely accomplished debut feature from writer-director Georgia Oakley, Blue Jean captures a specific moment in British history with almost uncanny accuracy. The graininess of the photography, the well-chosen soundtrack of punchy 1980s electro-socialist pop anthems, the way that Jean’s costumes subtly shift as she crosses between the straight world and the gay one: it’s as persuasive as it is powerful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T01:20:22Z","webTitle":"Russia strikes are crime against humanity, Zelenskiy tells UN, as power cut in Ukraine and Moldova","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-strikes-are-against-humanity-zelenskiy-tells-un-as-power-cut-in-ukraine-and-moldova","fields":{"bodyText":"Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said, “it’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war.” “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link. It comes as talks between the G7 and other pro-Ukraine allies to set a cap on the price of Russian oil reportedly hit a set-back, after a meeting between EU officials ended without agreement. The price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil will form part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow by limiting its revenues from oil exports. EU diplomats were reportedly unable to reach an agreement on what price the cap should be set at. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s Energy Ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops of nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. “It flew right over us. We heard a whistling sound and then it came down on the building,” said Ruslan Vorona, a local resident. He and his eight-year-old son, Oleksii, were sheltering and charging their phones in a tent set up by the emergency services. Another local man, Oleksandr, 28, who would not give his last name, said: “There were a few explosions. Two were quieter and one was louder, and one of the missiles went straight over my head.” Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo demanded at the security council meeting that Russia immediately stop the attacks, which violate international humanitarian law, stressing “there must be accountability for any violations of the laws of war.” US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Vladimir Putin was “weaponising winter to inflict intense suffering on the Ukraine people”. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the security council that Moscow was carrying out “strikes against infrastructure in response to the unbridled flow of weapons to Ukraine and the reckless appeals of Kyiv to defeat Russia”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest series of Russian strikes were a response to a decision by the European parliament to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” over its nine-month invasion of Ukraine, and its call for the 27-nation EU to follow. “Being unable to win in a fair fight with the Ukrainian army, Russia wages a cowardly war of terror against civilians,” Kuleba said, urging Kyiv’s western backers to supply more air defence systems. Wednesday’s decision by European legislators to recognise Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” is a symbolic political step with no legal consequences. Kyiv has for months called on the international community to declare Russia a “terrorist state,” and the EU parliament’s decision will probably anger Moscow. The resolution approved by EU lawmakers said the “deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine … and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror.” Ukraine praised the decision, with Zelenskiy calling for Russia to be “held accountable in order to end its longstanding policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jun/06/california-income-based-electricity-fees-2025","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T22:48:10Z","webTitle":"Richer people pay more: California’s dramatic change to electricity bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/06/california-income-based-electricity-fees-2025","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/06/california-income-based-electricity-fees-2025","fields":{"bodyText":"California will soon become the first state to determine residents’ electricity fees based on their income as part of a new effort to spur households toward full electrification and bring down the state’s soaring electricity costs for low-income Californians. Electricity bills are made up of fixed costs as well as fees that vary based on the amount of electricity residents use. Last year, the state passed a law giving the California public utilities commission a 1 July 2024 deadline to determine a fixed charge for household electric bills based on people’s income. The new income-based electricity bills could hit residents’ mailboxes as soon as 2025. Based on proposals currently under consideration, residents who make more than $180,000 a year could pay about $500 more annually on their electricity bills, while Californians who make less than $28,000 annually could save up to $300 a year. The law is part of the state’s answer of how to equitably transition away from carbon as an energy source. But state officials are already facing backlash from higher-income residents who don’t want to see their bills increase. The proposals have so far received more than 250 public comments, with a large number opposing the law. “Why should I pay for someone else’s bill when I paid thousands for solar?” one commenter wrote. California currently has some of the highest electricity costs of any state, according to a report that suggested the income-based model. California’s electricity prices range from one and a half times to double the national average. According to Severin Borenstein, one of the report’s co-authors and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, electricity prices in the state are so high because utility companies are also paying for damages from wildfires and buying back electricity from people who’ve installed rooftop solar panels, among other costs. They make up for these expenditures by raising the price for electricity use. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the state’s three largest utilities, said in a joint filing that the income-based charge was “urgently needed to support achievement of the state’s decarbonization goals”. Borenstein similarly said that high costs for using electricity can discourage people from electrifying their homes. The income-based model will allow utility companies to lower the price they charge for using electricity because they will collect more money from fixed charges. But the proposal has already come under fire, particularly from higher-income residents who would face heftier electricity bills under the new models. One commenter said they “vehemently oppose” the law. Another wrote that they were scheduled to have solar panels installed on their home, but would cancel the installation due to the proposal. But Borenstein said that people who power their homes with solar panels are only able to save money because of “massive subsidies” that drive up electricity prices for people on the grid. “It’s not that this proposal is unfair,” Borenstein said. “It’s that the status quo is unfair.” He continued: “Everybody can’t put in solar if we’re paying for all of these other costs through per-kilowatt-hour charges. That just gets you into a death spiral where prices go higher and higher. And we know who will be the last people that have solar. It will be poor people.” In theory, the fixed charge model will spur electrification. The state will still invest in electric chargers and other subsidies and people will pay less for each kilowatt of electricity they use. But it is not yet clear whether Californians will invest in electrifying their homes if they feel their wallets tighten from new fixed charges. Residents might also guzzle up more electricity if it costs less to use. The judge overseeing the commission’s proceeding will likely release a proposed decision early next year, said Terrie Prosper, a spokesperson for the commission. The draft decision will be available for public comment before the commissioners vote to approve or reject it. • This story was amended on 7 June 2023. An earlier version incorrectly stated that utility companies were paying subsidies to customers with solar panels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/31/germany-green-party-nuclear-ukraine-die-grunen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Ready to govern? How Germany’s Green party transformed its reputation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/31/germany-green-party-nuclear-ukraine-die-grunen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/31/germany-green-party-nuclear-ukraine-die-grunen","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s Green party once made its name campaigning against high military spending, nuclear power and dirty fossil fuels. Since taking office as part of Olaf Scholz’s three-party “traffic light” coalition government last December, however, Die Grünen have become the Bundestag’s most vocal advocates of supporting the Ukrainian resistance with heavy weapons. They have extended the running time of three nuclear power stations due to shut down at the end of the year, reactivated mothballed coal plants and built the country’s first terminals for importing fossil fuel in liquefied form. More surprisingly still, voters seem to like it. Unlike their two power-sharing partners, the centre-left SPD and the liberal FDP, the Greens are currently polling at a higher share of the vote than they achieved at federal elections last September. Their two most prominent politicians, the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and energy minister, Robert Habeck, have the highest approval ratings in the country. One year in, the environmental party can justifiably called one of the first winners of the post-Angela Merkel era. “The Greens have proven that they are ready to govern”, said Andrea Römmele, a professor of political science at Berlin’s Hertie School of Governance. “In politics you campaign in poetry and govern in prose, and they have come across as a party that doesn’t just want to work through their manifesto but engage with new challenges.” Both of the Greens’ leading lights have sought to present theirs as a party of doers, crossing over red lines of old in surprisingly fleet-footed fashion along the way. In spite of having campaigned on the promise to oppose “the export of weapons and armaments into war zones” as recently as September 2021, it was Baerbock who openly questioned Scholz’s reluctance to ship tanks to Ukraine this summer. Seemingly drained of confidence at the end of her unsuccessful run for the chancellery, she has looked in her element since taking charge of the foreign ministry, facing up to Russia’s foreign minister with an unsentimental candour that her predecessors have lacked. On a trip to Nigeria at the start of this week, where Baerbock and the German culture commissioner, Claudia Roth, handed back 20 museum artefacts once looted from the kingdom of Benin, a generational shift between the two former Green party leaders was palpable. Where 67-year-old Roth was enthusiastic and effusive, her 42-year-old party ally showed flashes of steel even at the emotional handover ceremony, at one point using praise of a female royal’s mask to politely reprimand her Nigerian counterpart for the low percentage of women in his government. Baerbock’s former co-leader Habeck, meanwhile, has been forced to make choices that contradict his party’s championing of renewables as Russia’s war in Ukraine upended decades of German energy policy. But he has done so with vigour: under his direction the economic ministry has passed 29 new laws within the first 11 months – his predecessors in each of last three electoral terms managed 40-odd in four years. Habeck has nationalised the energy company Uniper, the country’s largest importer of gas, put the German subsidiaries of Russian companies Rosneft and Gazprom into trusteeships, and managed to fill the country’s gas storage tanks to 100% by the start of winter, in spite of a complete ceasing of deliveries from Russia. If the country can avoid a scenario of gas rationing this winter, it will be in large part due to putting pragmatism above ideological posturing. “This government inherited a complete shambles and is at least showing the kind of ambition and dynamism in trying to clean up the mess that its predecessors lacked,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy expert at the German Economic Institute. “It’s making mistakes – but it’s also getting a lot of things right.” Blaming governments of the past for Germany’s current energy dilemma won’t serve the Greens for the length of a four-year term, however, especially if there is a sense that its own ideological red lines helped create the predicament in the first place. Confidence in Habeck’s ability to steer the economy clear of trouble took a dent over the autumn, as he U-turned on a series of new policies. Putting Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations, due to be phased out by the end of the year, into an “emergency reserve” standby status before announcing two would need to remain on the grid until next April was a cumbersome move, seemingly prioritising procedure over outcome. Since the Greens’ identity is less tailored to Habeck than the SPD’s to Scholz or the FDP’s to the finance minister, Christian Lindner, the reputation damage was limited. Still, for a moment Die Grünen looked like the party of can’t-do. “We have seen a lot of frantic activity in Habeck’s ministry, but not always an underlying sense of direction”, said Uwe Leprich, a climate policy specialist at the Saarland University of Applied Sciences. “He seems to have surrounded himself with advisers who are set on intervening in the market as little as possible,” said Leprich. One of the qualities that enabled Habeck’s and Baerbock’s rise was rhetorical skills that contrasted starkly with the taciturn ways with words of both Scholz and his predecessor as chancellor, Merkel. But such unfamiliar focus on outward-facing communication has also triggered some yearnings for the non-transparent backroom dealings of yesteryear. “A pragmatic business manager may have found a way to continue shipping in some Russian gas to keep down prices, like France and Japan did,” said Leprich. France became the world’s number one importer of Russian liquefied natural gas in April and May, and was still shipping in between 7-9% of its gas requirements from Russia in early September. The Green party’s message, in spite of the temporary and limited extension of nuclear running times, is that Germany can and must go 100% for renewable sources of energy. But while renewable sources are still subject to sudden weather-dependent fluctuations, gas-powered plants that could be quickly switched on and off were a key component of the national energy strategy as sold to the electorate by German governments – including this one. “Natural gas is irreplaceable for the transition period,” says the Scholz cabinet’s coalition treaty signed by the Greens last September. “The debate right now should be: what energy source do we combine renewables with?” said Johannes Güntert of Project Planet A, a small thinktank that tries to pitch an “eco-modernist” alternative to the Green’s current renewables vision. “The German Greens, who were founded as an anti-nuclear rather than a climate protection party, are sadly not unbiased in answering that question.” If high gas prices and energy shortages force German businesses to close down or relocate in the coming 12 months, the Greens may need to search even more deeply in their party’s soul to retain a reputation as the doers of this government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/23/ancient-rivalries-19th-century-russia-greece-turkey-revolutions","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-23T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"Ancient rivalries, social panic, revolution … the 19th century is back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/ancient-rivalries-19th-century-russia-greece-turkey-revolutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/23/ancient-rivalries-19th-century-russia-greece-turkey-revolutions","fields":{"bodyText":"Viewed on a timeline, the events and the people of history seem to grow ever more distant as the past slips away from a “modern” world that is constantly being made anew. For us, it is axiomatic that “this time it’s different”, because we are always covering new ground, always leaving the past further behind us. But the truth is that we have a non-linear relationship with the past, both with our own personal stories and with history more generally. There are moments when a history that had seemed finished and packed away suddenly moves into our vicinity, grabs us by the shoulders and starts to speak to us. Right now, this is happening with the 19th century. Take the “Eastern Question”. This central preoccupation of 19th-century European diplomacy bundled together problems arising from the enfeeblement of the Ottoman empire, the issue of access to the waterways linking the Black Sea with the Mediterranean, imperial rivalries in north Africa, Syria and Mesopotamia and the struggle to secure control over the land and sea routes linking the great powers with their global empires. In the course of the 20th century, the Eastern Question receded from view. The Ottoman empire was no more, Turkey was admitted to Nato, and in the light of the bipolar stability of the cold war, the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean no longer seemed of such pressing importance. There was no shortage of conflict in the region, but it unfolded within the framework imposed by the standoff between the two nuclear superpowers. In recent years, the Eastern Question (or at least the bundle of issues that were once known under that rubric) has acquired a new salience. We see it in the heightened geopolitical tension between Greece and Turkey, the squabbling between Egypt, Turkey and other players over the future of Libya, the disastrous effects of intervention in Syria, the conflict over grain exports from the Black Sea ports, and the consciously neo-Ottoman language and gestures of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president. Our epoch is marked – this is hardly a new observation – by the return of a genuine multipolarity, such as we have not known since 1945. This multipolarity has many dimensions. New regional powers have emerged, determined to shape events in their own spheres – Turkey and Iran are two of the most important examples. The transition from Deng Xiaoping’s policy of restraint under the maxim: “hide your power and always be patient” to the confident demeanour of today’s China is another facet of the new multipolarity. The tension between the US and Russia remains, but it no longer has the power to stabilise the system as a whole. This multipolarity is unsettling for us; for the people of the 19th century, it was all they knew. There are other commonalities. In the 20th century (or for most of it at least), Russia represented a radical alternative to western-style liberal democracy, a power driven by a philosophy of historical change whose attraction for people on the political left worldwide was never entirely extinguished. In today’s world, Russia has returned to its 19th-century role as the reactionary negation of western “liberalism”. To be sure, the special status of Russia and the US as custodians of the world’s largest strategic nuclear arsenals persists, as a legacy of the cold war. But the current war in Ukraine has less to do with the binary ideological oppositions of the 20th century than with a deeper history of wars and annexations along the Russian imperial periphery, a history that extends through and beyond the 19th century. I have spent the past few years writing a book about the 1848 revolutions – a cascade of political tumults that extended across the European continent – and here too I have been struck by the many resonances with our own time. The present anxiety around social precarity, the working poor and the cost of living – exacerbated today by the return of supply chain disruptions and fuel and grain price shocks – is reminiscent of the panic around the “Social Question” of the 1840s. Then, as now, people argued over whether mass impoverishment was the consequence of over-regulation, whether it resulted from deregulation and the resulting erosion of older forms of social cohesion, or whether it could be something produced by the modern economic system itself. The fascinating – and vexing – thing about these revolutions is their polyvocality, the fact that so many programmes and aspirations found simultaneous expression. The political forces that coalesced in the revolutionary spring of 1848, shaking the foundations of monarchies across the continent, soon spiralled off in different directions. The slow liberal politics of chambers and the fast radical politics of clubs and demonstrations came unstuck from each other. The rivalry between national groups pitted German and Croatian liberals and radicals against their Czech and Hungarian fellows. Nothing cohered. For contemporaries, it was difficult to make out the general direction of travel, so paradoxical and contradictory were the forces that the revolutions had unleashed. The complexity of 1848 was not primarily a function of the intrinsic difficulty of the problems confronting European societies, but rather of the great number and diversity of political groups and perspectives brought to bear on them. Karl Marx anticipated this when he observed in an essay of 1842 that the many-sidedness of the world was a function of the one-sidedness of its countless constituent parts. History does not repeat itself, but, as Mark Twain remarked, it often rhymes. What do these moments of déjà vu mean? They may in part be symptomatic of a narrow “presentism” that can see in the past nothing but endless reflections of its own preoccupations. But we should not exclude the possibility that such resonances reveal authentic affinities between one moment in history and another. The revolutions of 1848 seemed as old as ancient Egypt when I learned about them at school in the 1970s. Their complexity was a futile, antiquarian scrawl. But it’s different today. We are re-emerging from something that they did not yet know. The era of high industrialisation; the “take-off into sustained growth”; the rise of the great ideological party-political formations; the ascendancy of the nation-state and the welfare state; the rise of the great newspapers and the national television audience. These things, which we used to call “modernity”, are now in flux, their hold on us is waning. And as we cease to be the creatures of high modernity, new patterns of attention become possible. As the 20th century begins to lose its power over our imagination, it becomes engrossing, even instructive, to contemplate the people and situations of the 19th century: the fissured, multifarious quality of their politics; the churn and change without a settled sense of the direction of travel; the anxieties around inequality and the finiteness of resources; the entanglement of civil tumult with international relations; the irruption of violence, utopia and spirituality into politics. In 2011, as a chain of political upheavals cascaded across the Arab world, attention turned once again to the forgotten revolutions of 1848, which had exhibited a similarly contagious quality. In the west, too, we have seen symptoms of instability – chamber invasions, pop-up protest movements, crosscurrents of activism on social media – that recall the volatility of 1848. If a revolution is coming, it may look something like 1848: poorly planned, dispersed, patchy and bristling with contradictions.

Describing the survivors of a relegation battle as having made a “great escape” seems cliched but it is an accurate representation in these circumstances – for whoever stays up out of Leicester and Reading, the achievement will be remarkable. The stakes could not be higher – Leicester travel to Brighton having to match Reading’s result; Reading must beat Chelsea and hope the Foxes falter. That Leicester are in a position to stay up is one of the stories of this season. They looked down and out by the winter break, seven points adrift after seven defeats and a managerial shake-up. “We want to be history makers,” their manager, Willie Kirk, said on Thursday. “No team has ever turned around a seven-point deficit at the bottom in WSL history. We want to be the first to do that.” Significant backing from the owners – from the provision of top-class facilities to player recruitment – has added to the pressure. Relegation would be a huge step back in the direction of a club striving to establish its status in women’s football. Fortunes have changed dramatically in recent months. Kirk’s arrival, after the dismissal of Lydia Bedford, has turned things around. Confidence has seeped through a squad playing a developing brand of possession-based football. They have also been boosted by strong recruitment in January, bringing in players such as Janina Leitzig and Courtney Nevin. Last weekend’s home defeat by an out-of-form West Ham was a missed opportunity. A win would have ensured safety. “We had got to a stage where we were proving everybody wrong,” Kirk says. “It had almost flipped on its head and last week we were almost scared to let people down.” How the players handle that pressure on Saturday will be key. It was a result that handed Reading an almost unimaginable lifeline. Kelly Chambers’ side had been down and out after defeat by Tottenham 24 hours earlier, players and manager standing on the pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in almost weary acceptance that an eight-year tenure in the top flight was coming to an end. There is no denying that it has been a troubled season for Reading. One too many injuries, one too many comebacks required, one too many poor refereeing decisions – this has been the story of their campaign. Losing Deanne Rose to a ruptured achilles in the first game was a body blow. The electric Canadian forward was the focus of their attack, leaving a hole they have been unable to fill. The hallmarks of a Chambers’ team are their resilience and tenacity. Many consider them to be one of the best-coached clubs in the league, indicated perhaps by the calibre of players involved over the years: Fran Kirby came through their ranks; Fara Williams closed out her illustrious career there; the Wales centurion Helen Ward spent four seasons with the club. But without the resources to match, it has been a struggle. “You can look at other teams and even those in the relegation battle with us [and see] what their player budget is and what they were given in addition in January to make sure they did stay up or try to stay up,” Chambers says. “We just don’t have that.” Reading’s financial issues are well known and the worry if they go down is whether they will be able to recover. The challenge ahead could not be much bigger – heavyweights Chelsea stand in their way, vying for their fourth consecutive WSL title. It will require a monumental effort but in a strange sense would be trademark Reading, the tenacious underdogs who just never give in. “You have to [believe],” Chambers says. “I think if you just give up now or you don’t believe then what’s the point in stepping out there on Saturday? There’s obviously still a glimmer of hope there for us and like I said we just have to give everything we can on the day to do what we can.” In a sport where almost anything can happen, this season’s relegation battle has been eye-catching. For the club that survives, it will surely go down as one of the most remarkable comebacks in the league’s history; and for the one that doesn’t, there has to be the hope that the backing remains to aid their recovery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2023/jan/27/fern-maddie-review-tender-and-powerful-performance-of-ballads-old-and-new","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T11:07:34Z","webTitle":"Fern Maddie review – tender and powerful performance of ballads old and new","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/fern-maddie-review-tender-and-powerful-performance-of-ballads-old-and-new","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jan/27/fern-maddie-review-tender-and-powerful-performance-of-ballads-old-and-new","fields":{"bodyText":"‘This place is magical,” says Fern Maddie. She’s explaining that she just randomly met an audience member, who was about 50 and went to the same “weird hippy college” as her in her home state of Vermont. Maddie only recently took a break from living in the woods and tending goats there to play her first tour – only to bump into someone with mutual friends more than 3,000 miles away. You suspect the occasion was ordained by the folk musician’s acclaimed 2022 album Ghost Story, which she self-released, but found widespread acclaim beyond Vermont. Touring in support of the record, Maddie plays a mix of old and new songs, and opens with a run of traditionals: Cumberland Gap and Don’t You Go a Rushing. Beginning on guitar, her playing is understated, but as she switches to banjo it becomes more expressive and detailed, striking a deft balance between technical proficiency and eloquent fluidity. Her voice has the ability to soar but is contained and never bombastic; it occasionally recalls the delivery of Joanna Newsom, but with less of a sharp edge. Most often, it sounds tender and powerful at once. Despite a profound love of traditional ballads, Maddie’s own compositions, such as Northlands and the stirring Dorothy May, are often the most arresting. That being said, some of the songs from Ghost Story lack the texture and depth found on the record when performed live. This spareness, though, shifts the focus to nuances of Maddie’s voice. By stripping things to the bare bones, there is an amplified emotional intensity in the room. The intimate environment – a cosy cafe in residential Sheffield with a log burner – makes the show feel like a living room performance, with every string plucked and word sung heightened in intensity. No more so than on the final track, Ca’ the Yowes, a traditional song that, on her album, Maddie tweaked and mutated, incorporating drum machines and idiosyncratic time signatures. Here, she simply sings it a cappella: it’s a truly beautiful delivery that leaves the room in such a state of silence that the only other thing audible is the final embers of fire slowly burning out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T22:57:11Z","webTitle":"Jennifer Lawrence brings documentary about Afghan women to Cannes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/may/21/jennifer-lawrence-brings-documentary-about-afghan-women-to-cannes","fields":{"bodyText":"A documentary about the lives of three women living under the Taliban, co-produced by Jennifer Lawrence, has premiered at the Cannes film festival. Bread and Roses, shown at a special screening on Sunday, follows three Afghan women in the weeks after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 after the withdrawal of US troops. The documentary was made by Excellent Cadaver, a production company set up by Lawrence and her producer friend Justine Ciarrocchi. “Jen’s first response was to find an Afghan film-maker and give them a platform,” Ciarrocchi told the Hollywood Reporter. Directed by Sahra Mani, whose 2018 documentary A Thousand Girls Like Me looked at a sexually abused woman’s quest for justice, the film aimed to show how the lives of women changed overnight under Taliban rule. “This film has a message from women in Afghanistan, a soft message: please be their voice who are voiceless under Taliban dictatorship,” said Mani at the premiere. She added: “Now that women can no longer leave the house without the veil, I thought we should tell their stories.” While the featured women did not know each other, they are all are from different groups who protested against the Taliban coup. In an interview on the Cannes website, Mani – now living in France – said filming the documentary was difficult and the safety of those involved was a top priority. “The way in which their lives have changed under the Taliban is an everyday reality for us,” she added. “It’s life under a dictatorship, a cruel reality we cannot ignore.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/mar/08/fierce-fit-powerful-super-netball-roars-into-2023-on-quest-for-tier-one-recognition","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T01:30:22Z","webTitle":"‘Fierce, fit, powerful’: Super Netball roars into 2023 on quest for tier-one recognition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/08/fierce-fit-powerful-super-netball-roars-into-2023-on-quest-for-tier-one-recognition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/mar/08/fierce-fit-powerful-super-netball-roars-into-2023-on-quest-for-tier-one-recognition","fields":{"bodyText":"Since its inception, Super Netball has grappled with an identity crisis. Over the years it’s been variously marketed and consequently perceived as: an anodyne competition aimed at primary school girls fond of sparkly My Little Pony figurines, a world-class league likely to be embraced by casual male sports fans, and a brutal version of the grassroots game played by 1.2 million Australians that leaves players battered and bruised. In trying to please all masters since 2017, the league, its governing body Netball Australia and broadcasters have often disappointed many. But if the slick hype reel for season 2023 unveiled by broadcaster Fox Sports in Melbourne yesterday is anything to go by, the seventh iteration of Super Netball is going to step into its power as a fierce, fast and feminist sport. The 60-second spot puts a new spin on the familiar netball mantra of “Here If You Need”, highlighting the journeys of Malawian Melbourne Vixens shooter Mwai Kumwenda, who learnt to shoot on a rudimentary ring, South African Sunshine Coast Lightning defender Karla Pretorius, a new mother, and Sydney Swift Maddy Proud, who played the 2021 grand final with a broken rib. “Ifs can be iffy,” goes the voiceover. “Did Mwai care about ifs when she swapped tyre hoops for Vixens kit? Did Karla, when she came back after having her first kid? Hell, Maddy won a grand final with broken ribs. “We’re not just here if you need. No, we are what this game was meant to be. All of us together, no matter the creed. The crowds howl and teammates cheer, the new chant ringing in your ear. We are here.” It’s an ad that roars, a little like the Helen Reddy classic. If the unapologetic tone is reflected in marketing efforts this year, it could help the league realise its oft-cited potential as a tier-one sport. Many believe that quest relies on converting into fans the tens of thousands of Australian adults who play the sport, but historically haven’t watched it, as well as attracting new ones. Netball Australia chief executive Kelly Ryan said while “Here If You Need” will always resonate at the community level, Super Netball isn’t about such niceties. “You don’t come to a game because it’s a nice day out. You come because it’s the absolute pinnacle. We have amazing athletes and teams that work incredibly hard in the gym. They’re fierce, they’re fit and they’re incredibly powerful,” she said. “And it’s time that we actually made sure that we replicate that in a marketing sense and actually pitch this product the exact way that it’s intended … which is nothing but fierce contests, complete passion, commitment. We are here and we want people to notice, to recognise and appreciate the game for what it is.” Sue Gaudion, who joins former players Cath Cox, Bianca Chatfield, Stacey Francis-Bayman and Emily Beaton in commentary this season, said the promotion was about the league “owning what it’s always had.” “I don’t know if we’ve had a fear as a sport of standing out because we’ve always wanted to be so connected to our grassroots, (but) the reality of the situation is, when you watch any elite sport, it’s a different beast. It always will be. I’m really proud that the sport’s about to embrace the game for what it is,” she said. Gaudion, who will juggle broadcast duties with her role as general manager of pathways and performance at the reigning premiers the West Coast Fever, said Super Netball wasn’t about being a “nice person”. “Of course, the rules are there and we all embrace the rules, but they (the players) are athletic beasts and we need to promote that and be proud of it as females,” Gaudion said, on the eve of International Women’s Day. In the second year of Fox Sport’s five-year deal, two of four games each round will be available for free, while the other two remain paywalled. For the first time, select matches will be available in 4K ultra-high definition, a move host Hannah Hollis yesterday described as historic. Player “mic-ups” during warm-ups, coach interviews during play, live bench audio and huddle mics at quarter breaks will also return. All games will be called from the venue, after the broadcaster experimented with “down the tube” last season, an approach heavily criticised by fans, especially in Western Australia. Speaking at the launch, Melbourne Vixens co-captain Liz Watson made it clear her side was determined to avenge an embarrassing loss to the Fever in the decider last season. Watson said coach Simone McKinnis had told the group it’s rare to “back up” after losing grand finals. “So we’re saying: ‘We want to be that first team that can do that’ and it definitely fired us up,” she said. With a virtually unchanged line-up, Dan Ryan’s “green machine” West Coast fever side is favoured to go back-to-back though. The 2022 grand finalists face off in Perth in round one, which begins March 18."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/07/thursday-briefing-first-edition-boris-johnson-go","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-07T05:44:16Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Prime minister’s desperate bid to cling to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/07/thursday-briefing-first-edition-boris-johnson-go","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/07/thursday-briefing-first-edition-boris-johnson-go","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Well, he’s definitely getting the barnacles off the boat. 44 members of the government have resigned in less than 30 hours. Boris Johnson stormed past the previous record for the number of ministerial resignations in a single day with the departure of Mims Davies from the Department for Work and Pensions at 2.26pm; then they, and he, just kept going. Not content with this unprecedented performance, the prime minister further streamlined operations by firing Michael Gove shortly before the 10 o’clock news, boldly seizing back the initiative by forcing the Levelling Up bill committee to cancel a hearing tomorrow because there were no ministers left to attend it. Gove had committed the cardinal sin of confronting Johnson with reality, and got called a “snake” for his troubles. The last person to resign was health minister Edward Argar, at 10.45pm, and the departures only seem to have paused because everyone’s gone to sleep. Somehow, somehow, Boris Johnson is still in place, hunkering down in the No 10 bunker while Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries bring him news of successes on the eastern front. The normal phrase for prime ministers in this situation is “in office, but not in power”; this one is inoperable, but not inanimate. As ever, head to the website for the very latest. Today’s newsletter will set out the arguments he is trying to make to hold on to his job, the reasons they are certainly specious, and explain what might happen next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Criminal justice | Secretly videoing or taking photographs of people under their clothes or sharing “deepfake” pornography without consent could lead to prison sentences of up to three years, under new recommendations by the Law Commission of England and Wales. Coronavirus | Holidaymakers heading to and from the European mainland are being warned of a growing incidence of coronavirus, especially in tourist hotspots, which risks hampering travel plans. Security | Boris Johnson has admitted for the first time that he had met ex-KGB agent Alexander Lebedev at an Italian palazzo without officials present in April 2018, when he was foreign secretary. Johnson was responding to questions at the Commons liaison committee on Wednesday. Highland Park shooting | The man charged with killing seven people at a Fourth of July parade in a Chicago suburb has confessed to the mass murder and revealed that he also considered attacking a second parade in Wisconsin, authorities said on Wednesday. Ukraine | Nearly 9 million people have left Ukraine since Vladimir Putin invaded, the UN refugee agency has said, as the governor of Donetsk called on civilians still in the region to flee. In depth: Would he dare to embarrass the Queen? “Maybe this is a good opportunity to slim down government,” one senior No 10 source apparently suggested last night, with the kind of touching optimism familiar to any observer of information ministries in failed states. The last graph that looked like this was published on the day they removed the energy price cap: Rolling news broadcasts had a madcap, end of days feel, nicely captured by the BBC’s unsuspecting anchor Tim Willcox, shown here as a brief break from normal operations accidentally made it to air: Newsnight got the Comical Ali of the situation, dogged Johnson defender Peter Bone, on to explain why, in fact, it was business as usual. “You have to remember that there are 350-odd Conservative MPs and you have a few of them who have resigned,” the backbencher said. “But there was a vote of confidence a few weeks ago, and Boris won it.” The reality is that Johnson would now lose by a mile. But, as ConservativeHome’s Paul Goodman wrote, he does not appear likely to accept this if 1922 Committee chair Graham Brady sets out the facts: “This is the equivalent of handing a bottle of whisky and a revolver to the condemned man. Johnson will presumably first drink the whisky and then shoot Brady – metaphorically, that is”. The arguments enlisted by Johnson to support his decision to stay in spite of all this are specious, but they exist, so here’s what you need to know about them: *** Why Johnson claims he can stay When he appeared before the House of Commons liaison committee yesterday afternoon, Johnson did seem to show some basic awareness of the theoretical concept of political mortality, musing: “all flesh is grass”. In practice, he appears to believe he’s made of titanium. It’s worth quoting the argument given by a No 10 source to the BBC last night in all its frothingly chaotic glory, with a great big ‘sic’ applying to the whole thing: There is no lectern outside No10 tonight the PM fights on, there will be a couple of appointments tonight. But it’s not true – a procession of cabinet ministers telling him to go is not true. You will find out – some may have been beyond redemption but he’s been spelling out to them that 14 mil people voted for him and if the party want to deprive him doing that job they will have to take that mandate off them. He’s called their bluff. Graham Brady said there’s a 1922 election on Monday, new 1922 Committee by Tuesday, that committee could decide to change the rules. Momentum tonight is not going to dislodge him. As he explained to cabinet ministers tonight the chance is not Boris or no Boris the choice is giving him a new change with a fresh chancellor and new programme that Rishi was not prepared to do, tax cuts, or spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate – coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain. That’s the real choice. It’s time the party gets real with that. *** Why all of this is nonsense 1. Johnson did not fill any vacancies last night, despite that promise. His grip on power is so tenuous that even his new Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi visited to “stress the challenge of governing, given how many frontbenchers have resigned”. He now has cabinet vacancies in the Wales office and the department for levelling up, and more may very likely follow today. Government has plainly ground to a halt, and he can’t just make this meme about Dorries doing literally everything a reality. 2. It is, in fact, true that a procession of cabinet ministers told him to go: as well as Gove and Zahawi, they included Priti Patel, Grant Shapps, Brandon Lewis, and attorney general Suella Braverman, who also announced her own leadership bid on Robert Peston’s ITV show last night. (She will also be appearing on the Today programme this morning.) These are not the usual suspects. 3. While 14m people may have voted for Johnson in 2019, opinion polls suggest that he is now very unpopular. Comfortable majorities think he should resign, including most who backed him in the last election. 4. The warning to MPs that a snap election is the inevitable result of his own removal is not required in the constitution, or borne out by history. Andrew Sparrow, the Stakhanovite anchor of the Guardian’s live blog, provided a good summary of why this and other election-based arguments don’t stand up. 5. The claim that the best way forward is simply to fall in behind the leader and get enthused by his promise of tax cuts is simply not credible. Even some of those on the right of the party who are animated by this economic argument above anything else have recognised that Johnson is no longer a realistic vessel for their ambitions. They will feel that they have a better chance of being realised if they unite behind a new candidate who can assemble a team to enact their policy ambitions. *** What happens next There will probably be more resignations today, while Johnson may find some warm bodies to fill a few of the open berths. As explained above, his arguments will be harder to sustain if some of them are at cabinet level, and cannot be filled. Even his own officials acknowledge that if the 1922 Committee changes its rules and allows a new confidence vote on Monday, his position will become untenable if he loses. He will certainly lose any such vote. Technically – and we’re into extreme norm-breaking territory here – he could attempt to stay on as prime minister even after he is replaced as party leader. But as wild as his behaviour has been in the last 48 hours, that doesn’t seem likely. Either way, it’s surreal to imagine that the current state of utter dysfunction could drag on for another five days. The other prospect that has come under discussion is whether Johnson might try to force a new general election if he lost a confidence vote, out of … hubris? Spite? Pyromaniac excitement? He ruled that out in front of the liaison committee yesterday. Even if he wanted to do so, it seems likely that he would fail: the monarch and her advisers would likely conclude without fear of widespread contradiction that he had failed to reach the necessary bar. For what it’s worth, Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings says that Johnson would be dissuaded from attempting this by the prospect of “putting [the Queen] in an embarrassing position” (although that didn’t stop his unlawful suspension of parliament in 2019). If Cummings is right, we may have discovered a line that Johnson will not cross. But there are plenty more depths to plumb before we get there. *** Read more on Johnson’s refusal to leave Jessica Elgot’s ticktock of a surreal day. Rowena Mason’s assessment of the leadership race.

A Shasta county judge on Tuesday dismissed manslaughter and other criminal charges against Pacific Gas and Electric related to the Zogg fire, which killed four people as they tried to flee the fast-moving blaze that destroyed the towns of Igo and Ono. The trial – a rare occurrence as PG&amp;E has typically settled criminal cases – had been scheduled to start in Shasta county next week, and would have served as a public reckoning for a company that has already paid out billions in damages for wildfires started by its power equipment. As part of a settlement to avoid a trial, PG&amp;E has agreed to pay $45m to groups focused on rebuilding efforts and a $5m civil penalty, and to continue initiatives to reduce the risk of wildfires. The district attorney, Stephanie Bridgett, said in an interview with the Guardian that she did not agree with the judge’s decision to drop the charges, but that her office fought for a resolution that would help the community. “Our goal originally was to prosecute [PG&amp;E] criminally – to get a criminal conviction and force change that way,” she said. “This resolution does bring a lot of needed things into our community to prevent future fires, to make changes that need to be made within PG&amp;E but also to have the personnel and services to respond better in the future.” The settlement will fund fuel mitigation efforts, a scholarship program to increase the number of local firefighters, a large animal evacuation center and memorials to honor those who killed in the fire, among other efforts. PG&amp;E must also move some of its infrastructure underground, install new weather monitoring stations and meet regularly with the district attorney’s office to ensure it is complying with the agreement. “The agreement reflects our continuing commitment to making it right and making it safe. We stand behind our thousands of trained and experienced coworkers and contractors working every day to keep Californians safe,” Patti Poppe, the company’s CEO, said in a statement. PG&amp;E has been subject to intense scrutiny in recent years for its role in causing devastating and deadly wildfires in California. The company has been accused of repeatedly prioritizing shareholder profits over ensuring the safety of its infrastructure. In recent years, PG&amp;E equipment set off 31 wildfires that wiped away entire towns and killed 113 people. The company pleaded guilty in 2020 to more than 80 counts of manslaughter for its role in the 2018 Camp fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise. In Shasta county, the 2020 disaster started during a windstorm when a gray pine with defects that led to it being marked for removal fell on power lines in the rugged mountainous terrain east of Redding. Fueled by fire-friendly conditions, the blaze raced through the tiny towns and scattered homes in the foothills, consuming more than 56,000 acres (23,000 hectares), taking out hundreds of homes and forcing people to immediately evacuate. Four people died trying to escape the fire: Alaina Mcleod, 46, and her eight-year-old daughter, Feyla; Kenneth Vossen, who was badly burned as he sought refuge at a pond on his rural property; and Karin King, a 79-year old animal advocate and retiree. The case, Bridgett said, was about getting justice for the victims and forcing change in order to save lives and ensure that PG&amp;E doesn’t “continue the practices that led to the fire in the first place”. The judge who dropped the charges said in his ruling that the tree falling on company infrastructure did not necessarily mean PG&amp;E had been negligent. “The fact that the tree fell does not itself equate to gross negligence or recklessness,” the judge stated. That ruling was in contrast with another local judge who determined earlier this year there was enough evidence that the utility should stand trial for manslaughter. PG&amp;E had previously settled with the California public utilities commission for $150m after the regulatory agency alleged that “the tree that caused the fire was not removed in time because of PG&amp;E’s poor recordkeeping”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/22/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-elections-protocol","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T12:33:15Z","webTitle":"Northern Ireland power sharing slips to 2023 as few relish a winter election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/22/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-elections-protocol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/22/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-elections-protocol","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK has given a six-month deadline for the Northern Ireland protocol row to be resolved, indicating Liz Truss is far more relaxed about the absence of a devolved government in Stormont than previously indicated. An April 2023 date for the resolution of the Brexit row emerged after a meeting between the prime minister and the US president, Joe Biden, and would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday agreement. But the deadline extension means power sharing in Northern Ireland is, in effect, paused until next year despite legislation requiring elections this year if the parties cannot agree to return to Stormont. Parties elected in May were given 24 weeks, or until 28 October, to form a new executive at Stormont, but the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has been boycotting power sharing until the Northern Ireland protocol row is resolved. The April deadline creates a challenge for the newly appointed Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris. Under legislation brought in by his predecessor, Brandon Lewis, he is obliged to call a Northern Ireland assembly election if an executive is not formed by 28 October. This week, on his second only visit to Northern Ireland, he said that is exactly what he would do. “It’s not an idle threat – it’s not a threat at all. It’s a fact that the legislation says that I need to do that on 28 October,” he said. Few, however, believe that can now happen. None of the parties want a Christmas election. The Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, described the prospect of a winter election as “absolutely diabolical”. Census results released on Thursday showed Catholics outnumbered Protestants for the first time in the 100-year history of Northern Ireland. Jon Tonge, a professor of British and Irish politics at Liverpool University, said this confirmed that the religious basis for the state was no longer there. However, it doesn’t mean unionism would be eliminated in the next election. The census figures show that the majority of passport holders hold a British document, and that 17% of people do not identify with any religion, underlining the power of the centrist Alliance party, which came third in May’s election. Tonge said: “All a Christmas election would do is help Sinn Féin further crush the SDLP. It would perhaps allow the DUP to win back some votes from the Traditional Unionist Voice but we would end up with the same standoff over the protocol.” It appears likely that Heaton-Harris will legislate to extend the 24-week deadline to form an executive at Stormont, rather than force a new election. Does this all mean a protocol resolution is more likely, and can the US be the broker of such a deal? Tonge said both Biden and Truss were “pledging absolute fidelity to the Good Friday agreement”, but those pledges meant different things to each side. The British side was focused on getting the DUP back into Stormont and more compromises from the EU, while the US was focused on the Irish perspective. We can expect forked tongues in the next few weeks. Truss wants a negotiated deal and has limited bandwidth for Northern Ireland, but will keep the Brexit fire burning for domestic party reasons. “She is not going to be throwing flowers and love at the EU at her first party conference as prime minister,” Tonge said. • This article was amended on 27 September 2022.

In the dance programme alone there are two shows about living with chronic pain, and this funny, angry and wistful one by Australian Liz Lea about a severe case of endometriosis that had her regularly necking 10 Nurofen before lunchtime. Dancers make a living out of getting their bodies to behave and, as Lea tells us, by pushing the fine line between good pain and bad pain. Her pain tolerance was so high that her surgeon doubted she even needed the surgery (she really did) and compared cutting through her abdominal muscles to cutting through a brick wall – both are sources of misplaced pride in a body that was working against Lea and her dreams of having it all. In a (mostly) one-woman show, Lea touches on time at boarding school and as a fishnetted showgirl, followed by bowel function, rectal pain and incontinence. “I don’t teach jetés in class any more,” she explains, “because I’ll land and wet myself.” But, at 52, her physical control is still strong, and Lea has a wealth of dance languages absorbed into her body: notably, details from south Asian dance that are skilfully folded into her solos. The tone is sometimes hard to read; Red is full of smart lines and self-deprecation but with the feel of performing a script rather than sharing confidences – this is a woman still holding on to control – although she gets chattier in an updated coda that touches on free tampons and Scotland’s male period tsar. If Lea could give herself up to the messiness of it all and let the emotional (and drug-induced) highs and lows swell, a good show might be a great one. Red is at Dance Base, Edinburgh, until 28 August.

It’s a disquieting, uncompromising piece of theatre, though whether Mears succeeds in resolving the dichotomies at the work’s centre is debatable. Written in 1946, the opera to some extent reflects on postwar uncertainties and trauma. Britten and his librettist Ronald Duncan pivot between past and present, framing a narrative of ancient pagan violation with a Christian apologia that offers faith as consolation for the senseless brutality that’s been witnessed. Despite the power and beauty of the score, many have seen the resulting amalgam as dramatically unwieldy and ideologically incoherent. Mears’s solution is to emphasise the underlying outrage at the work’s centre, and the influence on his thinking of Sarah Kane’s Blasted is more than once apparent. Annemarie Woods’s set shows a domestic interior subject to repeated incursions of violence from a military conflict taking place beyond its confines. The sense of toxic masculinity is established early in an unsettling scene in which Tarquinius (Jolyon Loy), Junius (Kieran Rayner) and Collatinus (Anthony Reed) brutalise a female hostage, an episode that tells us much about both Tarquinius’s sense of his own entitlement and Junius’s opportunistic resentment, but which also squares uneasily with the sincerity of feeling that Collatinus later expresses for Lucretia (Anne Marie Stanley). This is very much a world in which women are relentlessly objectified, and not just sexually. Lucretia is first presented as something of a domestic celebrity, giving a television interview during the spinning trio with Bianca (Carolyn Holt) and Lucia (Sarah Dufresne). Later, after her suicide, Junius coldly takes photographs of her corpse for his own political purposes. Much of it is angrily powerful, but it also leaves the Male and Female Choruses (Michael Gibson and Sydney Baedke) somewhat stranded on the peripheries when they should perhaps be more central: he leafs with fascinated horror through files dealing with the tale he is telling; she obsessively clutches Lucretia’s photograph. Their religious sincerity is touching, but also seems ineffectual, which is perhaps Mears’s point. Musically it’s extremely fine, with superb central performances from Stanley and Loy. Stanley, with her rich contralto, is dignified, vulnerable and extraordinarily moving. Loy’s Tarquinius seems all the more dangerously psychopathic for being so charismatic of both voice and presence. Gibson and Baedke are comparably strong: he is wonderfully fervent and eloquent; she offsets moments of steely authority with exquisite lyricism. Dufresne’s clear, bell-like soprano contrasts nicely with Holt’s warm mezzo. Reed sounds darkly sonorous as Collatinus, while Rayner’s Junius is all shifty elegance and duplicitous charm. Corinna Niemeyer, meanwhile, conducts with detailed subtlety and beautifully understated intensity. The playing is excellent. The Rape of Lucretia is at Linbury theatre, London, until 22 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T19:56:46Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: RBA rate warning, thousands miss power bill rebates, four-day work week trial ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone.

In the wake of a new Guardian Essential poll that suggests some Australians believe renewables are a significant contributor to higher power prices, Bowen will use a speech in Sydney on Wednesday to argue the current global energy crisis underlines the need for a faster and more orderly transition to renewables, because renewables are the cheapest form of generation. The climate minister will warn that long-term opponents of action to address the climate crisis – a coterie he characterises as “the usual suspects” – are already using increases in the cost of living and soaring power bills as a justification to “delay or avoid the need to decarbonise and drive towards renewables”. Bowen will point to a “daily drip feed of editorials and opinion pieces” in recent weeks blaming high power prices on renewable technology rather than the critical causal factor, which is the global shock in energy markets created by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The climate minister will note the promulgators of this line “are the same people who have moved from excuse to excuse, alibi to alibi, to avoid climate action, and have denied Australia the benefits of taking real action on climate over the last decade”. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, used his recent budget reply speech to target the government over its push to reach 82% renewables by 2030, contending it would only add to the cost of electricity bills for struggling families and businesses. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The latest Guardian Essential poll underscores the potential salience of Dutton’s contentions. It shows respondents are more inclined to blame profiteering by energy companies or “efforts to fight climate change, such as the shift towards renewable energy” than the war in Ukraine for a significant increase in power bills. The poll also confirms most people want governments to intervene in the market to deliver consumer price relief. Bowen will say the Albanese government is working with states and regulators on a regulatory intervention to help address high power prices, after an “honest” Treasury forecast in last week’s budget pointed to a 56% increase over this year and next. Bowen will use Wednesday’s speech to double down on Labor’s plans to roll out high voltage transmission infrastructure to accommodate more renewable generation in the national electricity grid, and push back against the political positioning. “We cannot let, and the government will not let, the current crisis interrupt our drive towards cleaner, cheaper, renewable energy,” the climate minister will say. “This transition is even more important – not only for reasons of climate, as compelling as those reasons are – but also because renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, which is rather handy in an affordability crisis.” Bowen will note that a majority of Australians voted for more serious action to address the threat of the climate crisis in the federal election, but that doesn’t mean the decade-long climate wars are over. He will say the Liberal and National parties are intent on promulgating a debate about nuclear energy as a “rearguard attempt to undermine and deny the transition to renewables”. Bowen will argue the small modular nuclear reactors championed by some in politics and the media have the status of “someday, maybe, reality”, because none are licensed and no projects have achieved financial close. “I raise this strongly because we need to be vigilant in the climate debate,” Bowen will say. “Whilst the May election was a big step forward in ending the climate wars, and resulted in the election of a government with a strong climate agenda and a progressive majority in both chambers, we should not pretend that there are no voices seeking to take us backwards, and they must be countered if we are to ensure the progress we are making is cemented in.” Bowen will underscore the point by reprising what happened after the last major climate election. “In 2007, a Labor government was elected with a strong climate agenda, and the Liberal party took an emissions trading scheme to that election. “It was widely thought that we had reached a national consensus on climate change. It wasn’t to be.” Bowen will argue it is important to speak plainly about what has happened in the past, saying for too long, too many politicians and commentators have got away with telling Australians that action on climate change comes at the expense of their economic security. “It’s always been a lie,” the climate minister will say. “It’s never been more than a lie today, with the economic opportunities for Australia replete before us. “It now falls to us make that opportunity a reality, and to engage the Australian people in a frank and open conversation as we do so. And that’s exactly what we intend to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/10/secret-queen-soft-power-prime-ministers-elizabeth-ii-british-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T16:40:03Z","webTitle":"Secret of the Queen’s soft power – across seven decades and 15 prime ministers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/10/secret-queen-soft-power-prime-ministers-elizabeth-ii-british-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/10/secret-queen-soft-power-prime-ministers-elizabeth-ii-british-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"For seven decades, she bore intimate witness to the shifting of power around the globe. Coming to the throne in the distant era of Stalin’s Russia, Elizabeth II reigned through wars cold and hot and through sweeping economic change. She presided over Britain’s retreat from empire and its emergence as a modern networked power, but also its struggle to forge a post-Brexit identity and the beginning of a painful reckoning with colonialism. With her goes a unique institutional memory, a reservoir of insights shared with 15 prime ministers. The relationship between constitutional monarch and elected politician is an odd one – part bowing-and-scraping deference, part curious intimacy. Tony Blair said she was the one person to whom he spoke freely, knowing it wouldn’t leak, and the Queen herself once described her function as “a sort of sponge”, soaking up confidences. But it also, she added, occasionally involved offering governments a different point of view: ‘perhaps they hadn’t seen it from that angle’. She was a mistress of soft power, knowing when to project full regal majesty and when to play kindly grandmother, and a unique diplomatic resource. At times she could make Britain’s case to a foreign head of state better than any elected politician. (Contrast Emmanuel Macron’s spiky relationship with Liz Truss and the genuine warmth of the French president’s tribute to the Queen.) Never party political, she was nonetheless core to the body politic, and her relationships with successive prime ministers help tell a story of what Britain has become. In February 1952, a nation finding its footing in a postwar world acquired a 25-year-old Queen still finding hers. She leaned heavily at first on the counsel of Winston Churchill, half a century her senior; after he retired in 1955, she wrote to him that no other PM could ever “hold the place” of her first. Her second, Sir Anthony Eden, would meanwhile lead the country into national humiliation. The failed invasion of Egypt now known as the Suez crisis was a hard lesson in wartime statecraft and in the decline of Britain’s influence over former colonies. Under Harold Macmillan, who became PM in 1957 and with whom she developed a close rapport, she oversaw the unwinding of empire and the founding of the Commonwealth. But it was her first Labour PM, Harold Wilson, who brought the “wind of change” – Macmillan’s phrase, coined to signal the end of Britain’s resistance to independence movements – back home. Wilson’s background was humbler than that of his predecessor Sir Alec Douglas-Home, yet he enjoyed a relaxed relationship with the Queen. His was the era of the space race, the “white heat” of technology, and personal liberation: homosexuality decriminalised, abortion legalised, and a swinging 60s culture that risked making the royals look stiff. In 1969, the Queen duly allowed TV cameras into Windsor Castle for an intimate documentary showing the family’s human side. The era of mystique and distance was ending. In 1970, Ted Heath succeeded Wilson, in eerily familiar circumstances: industrial unrest, rocketing inflation, an oil price shock and energy shortages. The Queen wanted to acknowledge these hardships in her 1973 Christmas message, but Heath vetoed it. Might the new king have more leeway this year? Wilson’s short-lived return in 1974 gave way in 1976 to James Callaghan, PM through both the high of the Queen’s silver jubilee and the lows of the winter of discontent, but still reportedly a favourite of hers. In 1979 however came a milestone: her first female PM, Margaret Thatcher. Despite much speculation about the two women’s personal differences – Thatcher clearly didn’t enjoy trudging across grouse moors at Balmoral – the real tension was over policy. Thatcher’s reluctance to increase sanctions against an apartheid-era South Africa enraged Commonwealth leaders, and the Queen reportedly sided with the latter. Thatcher’s downfall in 1990 saw more bitter political infighting over Europe under John Major, and a sterling crisis culminating in the Black Wednesday crash. But the Queen appreciated Major’s support during her own “annus horribilis” of 1992, with Prince Charles’s marriage unravelling and some asking whether the monarchy could survive. Five years later, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, brought those questions rushing back. A new PM, Tony Blair, deftly caught the mood of grief for the “people’s princess”, but the Queen came across as too remote, and relations between No 10 and the Palace deteriorated. Rumours spread that the Queen was unhappy with New Labour’s plans to ban foxhunting and reform the House of Lords. Things weren’t much easier after Gordon Brown succeeded Blair in 2007, although the Queen was keenly interested in the banking crisis, asking pointed questions about failures in economic forecasting while visiting the London School of Economics. It was the constitutional upheaval under David Cameron, however, that really tested relations between monarch and state. Things began well, with a 2011 visit to Ireland in which the Queen candidly acknowledged sufferings under British rule. She gamely joined in a James Bond skit at the following year’s Olympic opening ceremony, suggesting a monarch and country at ease with themselves. Two years later, however, came the Scottish independence referendum, after which Cameron was overheard telling how she had “purred with pleasure” at the result – a serious breach of her political neutrality. Worse still, before the Brexit referendum, an unnamed minister told the Sun she supported Leave. By 2016, when Theresa May succeeded Cameron, the country was bitterly divided. Seeking to carve a new post-Brexit role for Britain in the world, May leaned heavily on royal soft power. The then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge led a charm offensive in European capitals, and the Queen’s presence helped smooth a difficult 2019 state visit from Donald Trump, who craved her approval. When a politically floundering May was ousted that summer by Boris Johnson, however, something cracked. Attempting to force his Brexit deal through, Johnson embroiled the Queen in a prorogation of parliament subsequently deemed unlawful. She grieved alone in a socially distanced pew at her beloved husband’s funeral the day after Johnson’s aides had thrown a raucous lockdown-busting party. The Queen’s dutiful willingness to suffer the privations of a pandemic alongside her people contrasted painfully with what now passed for political leadership. Yet the monarchy had its own troubles in this period, from Prince Andrew’s public disgrace to allegations of royal racism in the wake of Prince Harry’s break with the family. This spring’s ill-judged Caribbean tour by the Cambridges, meanwhile, stirred up demands for reparations for slavery, anger over the Windrush immigration scandal (which erupted on May’s watch) and talk of Jamaica becoming a republic. Suddenly, history appeared to be catching up with a monarchy that had long outrun it. The dying Queen’s final public act was the kissing of hands with Liz Truss, sealing one last orderly transfer of political power. The circle is unbroken; the line continues under a new prime minister and king. But who knows where, in seven decades’ time, it will lead?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/26/russia-firing-ageing-cruise-missiles-because-stocks-are-depleted-mod-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T10:39:34Z","webTitle":"Russia firing ageing cruise missiles because stocks are depleted, MoD suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/26/russia-firing-ageing-cruise-missiles-because-stocks-are-depleted-mod-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/26/russia-firing-ageing-cruise-missiles-because-stocks-are-depleted-mod-suggests","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia is firing ageing cruise missiles stripped of their nuclear warheads at Ukrainian targets because Vladimir Putin’s stocks are so depleted, the Ministry of Defence has suggested. An intelligence update from the British MoD on Saturday said the desperate improvisation by the Russian president’s struggling forces are “unlikely to achieve reliable effects”. The evidence cited is pictures of apparently shot down AS-15 Kent air-launched cruise missiles, which were said to have been designed in the 1980s as a nuclear delivery system. The MoD said the nuclear warheads had probably been replaced with ballast, with the Kremlin’s hope probably that the missiles will distract Ukrainian air defences. “Although such an inert system will still produce some damage through the missile’s kinetic energy and any unspent fuel, it is unlikely to achieve reliable effects against intended targets,” a statement said. “Whatever Russia’s intent, this improvisation highlights the level of depletion in Russia’s stock of long-range missiles.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said 6 million households are without power after the Kremlin targeted Ukrainian infrastructure with missile strikes. There are growing fears that a major health crisis will hit the Ukrainian people as snow and sub-zero temperatures couple with lack of heating. In a rare public spat Zelenskiy criticised the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, for doing what he said was a poor job setting up emergency shelters to help those without power and heat after Russian attacks. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, visited Kyiv this week and pledged “hands-on” support to help Ukraine through the winter as he committed an extra £3m to help rebuild infrastructure. He said: “As winter sets in, Russia is continuing to try and break Ukrainian resolve through its brutal attacks on civilians, hospitals and energy infrastructure. Russia will fail. “The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine.” Cleverly said the bulk of the infrastructure funding would go to newly liberated areas in southern Ukraine such as Kherson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/04/birmingham-six-why-so-hard-for-judiciary-to-admit-theyd-jailed-innocent-man-16-years","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T08:32:07Z","webTitle":"Why was it so hard for our judiciary to admit they’d jailed an innocent man for 16 years? | Rowan Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/birmingham-six-why-so-hard-for-judiciary-to-admit-theyd-jailed-innocent-man-16-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/birmingham-six-why-so-hard-for-judiciary-to-admit-theyd-jailed-innocent-man-16-years","fields":{"bodyText":"Hugh Callaghan, a former welder, a follower of Aston Villa football club, born in Ardoyne, Belfast, died late last month aged 93. A man who loved music, he was singing to his nurses until shortly before his final heart attack. He was a gentle, generous individual whom I was lucky enough to meet. He had every right to pass a quiet life, but he spent 16 years in prison for a crime he did not commit: along with other members of the Birmingham Six, as they were labelled, he was wrongfully convicted of killing 21 people in 1974 in the bombings of two pubs in Birmingham. One of the many shocking aspects of the case was the determination of the British establishment – the law, police, politicians, media – to maintain the men’s guilt, and keep them in prison. It would be “an appalling vista”, said the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, in 1980, if the police were found guilty of violence, threats and perjury – so much so that it would be better if the truth were suppressed. The question for the present is whether, in a time of mounting reports of police misconduct, similar miscarriages and suppressions could happen now. At the time of the bombings, the British police were generally regarded as reliable, decent and fair, reassuring figures in their old-fashioned helmets, unarmed, portrayed in popular TV series such as Dixon of Dock Green and Z-Cars as level-headed forces for good. It was barely comprehensible to much of the public that they could act as they did in the cases of the Birmingham Six or the Guildford Four, who were also wrongly convicted of a bombing after beatings by the police. For Denning and others, it was essential that this perception be upheld at all costs. Before their ultimate acquittal, the six had previous appeals rejected by judges who appeared, as the Independent put it in 1988, to “find the prospect of police malfeasance too frightful to contemplate”. According to Irish cabinet papers from 1989, the British Home Office had indicated that its main concerns about the potential overturning of convictions were “to avoid giving scandal” and “the credibility problems for police evidence in court hearings”. Newspapers played a vigorous part, referring to the six as “the bombers” even before they were first convicted. “We would have been tempted,” said the Sun in 1988, “to string ’em up years ago.” It also ran a front page headline – “Loony MP backs bomb gang” – to denigrate Chris Mullin, the journalist and politician whose persistent reporting eventually led to the release of the six. No police were ever convicted for their brutal assaults, and smears and innuendo continued even after the men were exonerated. The Sunday Telegraph and the Sun, using discredited policemen in the case as sources, continued to allege their guilt – for which, following legal action by the six, they were obliged to print apologies. In 1998, a former Conservative MP, David Evans, had to pay damages for libel, after he had told a school in his constituency that the men had committed the crime. It’s likely, as a result of this misinformation, that for some people there’s a lingering sense that the six were somehow a bit guilty. “You’re one of the bad boys,” said a neighbour to Callaghan, when he moved into the east London house where he spent the last years of his life. “Controversial,” said a relative, when I told him I was meeting Callaghan last year. He was neither bad nor controversial – though others’ treatment of him was. Meanwhile, thanks to the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four cases and notorious events such as the Hillsborough disaster, the police lost some of their public esteem. It became easier to believe that they might do wrong, while procedures for such things as interviewing suspects were tightened up, in order to prevent forced confessions. But they continue to act with something close to impunity. Despite the widespread horror about the murder of Sarah Everard by the serving officer Wayne Couzens, and the revelations about the harbouring of rapists and sexual abusers within the force, and other tales of misogyny and misconduct, there’s still not much sign of genuine accountability. Rather, empowered by new laws, the police felt free (for example) to arrest Night Stars volunteers trying to protect women from sexual harassment in central London, on the grounds that the rape alarms they distribute might be used to frighten horses at the coronation. Or, also at the time of the coronation, to arrest and detain peaceful protesters. Sections of the media cheer them on: the Daily Mail described the volunteers, with no evidence, as “militant activists” intent on a “plot” to disrupt the ceremonies. One of the lessons of the Birmingham Six case is that unconstrained police power leads to abuses. If the media encourage them rather than call them to account, and if politicians and courts seek to excuse them, they only get worse. True justice for the victims of atrocities and security for the British public – as might have been achieved by the conviction of the actual Birmingham bombers – are betrayed. Mullin once said that something like the wrongful conviction of the Birmingham Six couldn’t happen again, because of the changes in rules about gathering evidence. It’s probably true that such outrages couldn’t take place in exactly the same way. But, in different ways, they assuredly can. • Rowan Moore is an Observer columnist • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said that at least three people were killed and 213 wounded by the latest quakes, after a large government hospital in the city of İskenderun in the north of Hatay province declared it was evacuating patients. The quake was felt in neighbouring Syria, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported more than 500 injured in the north-west. One person was reported dead in the town of Samandag in Hatay by Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD. Residents there said more buildings collapsed but most of the town had already fled after the initial earthquakes. Mounds of debris and discarded furniture lined the dark, abandoned streets. The latest quakes, less powerful than the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude earthquakes that tore a path of destruction through southern Turkey and northern Syria on 6 February, threaten yet more devastation in a region where many people have fled their destroyed homes for the safety of other towns and villages outside the quake zone. The larger quake struck at a depth of just 2km (1.2 miles), the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said, potentially magnifying its impact at ground level. It was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. Turkey’s disaster management agency AFAD said the epicentre of the larger quake was below the Defne district of Hatay, in a region where many have complained of a lacklustre government response to the first earthquakes. In the Hatay town of Ekinci, Ata Koşar – who lost his brother, sister-in-law and nephew when their nearby luxury apartment block collapsed during the earthquakes two weeks ago – said: “It was the first day we’d decided to stay in our house as it’s just one floor, and I was using our heater to try to stay warm, demonstrating what to do in case another earthquake happened. “I was lying on the floor, and as I was lying there another earthquake happened. We heard what sounded like more buildings collapsing again, and more damage to our house.” The mayor of Hatay, Lütfü Savaş, immediately raised concerns that the latest quakes had caused yet more destruction across the province, and potentially further loss of human life in a place already dealing with some of the worst devastation in Turkey. “Some buildings were destroyed, there are some who are trapped under the rubble,” he said. In Samandag, where the country’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD reported one person dead, residents said more buildings collapsed but most of the town had already fled after the initial earthquakes. Mounds of debris and discarded furniture lined the dark, abandoned streets. Muna al-Omar, a resident of Antakya, said she was in a tent in a park when the 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit. “I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,” she said, crying as she held her seven-year-old son in her arms. “Is there going to be another aftershock?” she asked. Those who had remained in Hatay for two weeks after the first quakes said they had done so out of fear of losing their homes entirely, or a sense that they had nowhere else to go. The death toll in Turkey from the quakes two weeks ago rose to 41,156 on Monday, AFAD said, and was expected to climb further, with 385,000 apartments known to have been destroyed or seriously damaged and many people still missing. At least 47,000 people are estimated to have died across Turkey and Syria. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said construction work on nearly 200,000 apartments in 11 earthquake-hit provinces of Turkey would begin next month. Hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on a visit to Turkey that Washington would help “for as long as it takes” as rescue operations and aftershocks were winding down and the focus turned towards urgent shelter and reconstruction work. Blinken viewed the devastation in Hatay province with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on Sunday, pledging an additional £83m in aid to Turkey and Syria on top of the £71m initially pledged by Joe Biden. “It’s hard to put into words,” Blinken said, trying to describe what he saw. “Countless buildings, communities, streets, damaged or fully destroyed.” In rebel-held Syria, local search and rescue services and the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, reported the latest earthquakes had damaged buildings across a number of cities and towns. They said people had been injured by falling debris and crowd crushes, as well as jumping from elevated positions in fear of the destruction. Among the survivors of the earthquakes are about 356,000 pregnant women who urgently need access to health services, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency (UNFPA) has said. They include 226,000 women in Turkey and 130,000 in Syria, about 38,800 of whom will deliver in the next month. Many of them are sheltering in camps or exposed to freezing temperatures and struggling to get food or clean water. In Syria, already shattered by more than a decade of civil war, most deaths have been in the north-west, where the UN said 4,525 people were killed. The area is controlled by insurgents at war with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, complicating aid efforts. Syrian officials say 1,414 people were killed in areas under the control of Assad’s government, amid concerns that the true figure was likely to be far higher before the second earthquakes struck. As of Monday morning, 197 trucks loaded with UN humanitarian aid had entered north-west Syria through two border crossings, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. The World Food Programme has been pressuring authorities in that region to stop blocking access for aid from Syrian government-controlled areas.

As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/09/serious-concerns-raised-in-nz-about-environmental-impact-of-major-productions-including-amazons-rings-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-08T21:00:10Z","webTitle":"Serious concerns raised in NZ about environmental impact of major productions including Amazon’s Rings of Power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/serious-concerns-raised-in-nz-about-environmental-impact-of-major-productions-including-amazons-rings-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/09/serious-concerns-raised-in-nz-about-environmental-impact-of-major-productions-including-amazons-rings-of-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Picture three scenes: in a sheltered clearing, a stand of trees stretches skyward, trunks pale against the dark soil, leaves dappling the ground like golden dollar coins. In another, a maelstrom of white flakes is carried in eddies by the wind. In a third, sheer cliffs are slick with snow, icicles hanging like shards of glass. Scenes like these have formed the visual signature for onscreen adaptations of the Lord of the Rings, including Amazon’s latest, monster-budget offering, The Rings of Power. That association has helped form the bedrock of a decade of New Zealand tourism campaigns, showcasing the country’s pristine environments to the world. But the tree trunks in this clearing are not part of Aotearoa’s 9m hectares of native forest – they are carved polystyrene. The thousands of scattered leaves are woven polyester. The soil is actually a mess of plastic and bark chips. The white flakes are shaved polystyrene. And the cliffs were soon to be crushed into fragments and taken to landfill: one of a multitude of set-pieces trashed and dumped in the wake of major film productions. Workers involved in Amazon’s The Rings of Power as well as other international studio productions in New Zealand say that behind the glamour and cashflow the industry is touted for lie serious concerns about its enormous environmental impact, including emissions and waste, partly underwritten by New Zealand’s government. They say the true size of that environmental cost is typically hidden from the public: by studio walls, and because some crew members are afraid to speak out because they risk being blacklisted for raising concerns. The Guardian reviewed on-set photographs, internal communications, and interviewed six production workers on condition of anonymity, including four who worked on Rings of Power and others who worked on other major productions and were familiar with the processes. Those interviewed said they believed the industry could, and should do better – and the New Zealand government could be doing more to regulate the environmental impact of film productions. “I’m speaking out because I like film. I like working in film, I want to continue in the industry, but not in the way it is currently,” says Andi*, who worked on the Rings of Power and other major international-studio film productions. “It’s appalling what’s happening, and most people don’t know about it,” they said. “If people knew how destructive the whole business is, they would think twice.” “If huge corporations want to come to this country and use the beauty that’s here, [there’s a duty] to preserve the beauty,” says Joe*, who worked on multiple large productions. “They’re getting tax cuts, and then we’re left with all their trash. It’s heartbreaking. I feel like New Zealanders are being completely taken advantage of.” “Compared to our colleagues abroad, New Zealand is not even trying,” says Sam*, an industry worker who has been employed on major international film productions across New Zealand and abroad. Mountains of waste Leaked internal communications from The Rings of Power’s sustainability team, which was fully appointed almost a year into the production in January 2021, indicate the team was struggling to get to grips with the size of the problem. “The environmental impact of this industry, and of this show, is enormous,” one memo to staff reads. After holding discussions with the crew, they write, “every single person we spoke to is concerned about the environmental impact”. By July 2021, they write, the first season of the show, which is equivalent to around three to four films, had generated roughly 14,387 tonnes of carbon dioxide – five times what the British Film Commission estimates an average “tentpole”, or blockbuster, film would produce. Calculating how much waste the production had sent to landfill was more difficult – the team notes their figures won’t capture the total waste, as the company was using “multiple vendors” and “we still have a lot yet to count”. One vendor reported collecting 11,433 cubic metres of landfill waste so far that season – about four-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools. A second collected 30.5 cubic metres of soft plastic and 1,885 cubic metres of landfill waste. A third reported having collected 355.5 tonnes of landfill waste – the weight of around 25 London double-decker buses. The team had success with some initiatives: recycling office paper waste and batteries, installing an electric vehicle charging station at each studio, introducing re-usable water bottles, encouraging crew to eat vegetarian one day a week, and working with local disposal companies to compost or recycle 3,490 cubic metres of waste – but the scale of disposal remained enormous. As estimates were calculated only up to July 2021, final figures would likely be higher, with wrap and post-production work continuing until the start of 2022. New Zealand has fought hard to attract and retain major international productions. But crew members described waste disposal practices on many local sets as “insane,” “horrendous,” “sad,” and “embarrassing”. Workers say that while some sets were shipped offshore for re-use, others were trashed. Large quantities of contaminated waste were sent to landfill – much of which the workers believe could have been avoided with planning to minimise contamination and recycle materials. “On the Rings of Power, these massive ice walls and rock wall set pieces – they get smashed into a million pieces,” Andi says. “If anyone went and sat outside one of these big productions and saw how many skip bins are going out every day … Truckloads and truckloads and truckloads of polystyrene and timber and all the rest of it, mixed up in plastic … and really just thrown into a hole in the ground,” they said. As the season wrapped, the sustainability team wrote that their work so far had been “largely diagnostic”. “As we figure out what’s going on, we can identify the issues and figure out how things might be done differently moving forward,” they wrote. “Next season, we can do things right from the outset.” Those changes, if they occur, will come too late for New Zealand – the production has left, opting to film season two in the UK. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to respond on-record to individual questions on the specifics of the production’s final carbon footprint, waste footprint, disposal of sets, water use, or waste disposal practices. They said in a written statement that “Sustainability practices in New Zealand for the first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power either met or exceeded industry standards, even during the height of the pandemic,” and “the production made every effort to be a good corporate citizen and was compliant with New Zealand environmental laws and regulations”. They said sustainability staff had “enabled the production to successfully achieve a carbon footprint that was lower than industry benchmarks”, but declined to add to their statement what the final carbon footprint was or what industry benchmarks they measured it against. The spokesperson said the company had worked with local vendors who “helped the production donate water from stage tanks to the local fire department, plastics … for agricultural fencing, and divert many other production materials for community donation, reuse, and recycle.” An industry-wide problem While Rings of Power is the largest-budget and highest-profile example, workers say it reflects wider problems, and workers contracted to other large, international studio productions in New Zealand make similar criticisms about their practices. Those issues have haunted the international industry for some time. The Producer’s Guild of America has called on the industry to face up to its “massive carbon footprint, producing millions of metric tons of CO2 per year,” and said that the “sustainability measures currently being taken in our industry are sporadic and wholly inadequate”. The British Film Institute and Bafta have calculated the average “tentpole” film generates 2,840 tonnes of CO2 during production, equivalent to 11 one-way trips from the Earth to the moon. “Working on film sets … was when I really discovered just the magnitude of the waste,” says Emellie O’Brien, founder of environmental consultancy Earth Angel, that works with major international productions. “We obviously construct these massive sets, we shoot in them for a few days sometimes, then we tear them all down – and typically, that’s going into a dumpster.” In New Zealand, some workers claimed concerns and suggestions they raised for how to decrease waste and emissions on-set fell on deaf ears, or appeared to be seen as a hindrance to hitting deadlines. Others said they were afraid to raise concerns, fearing possible dismissal or blacklisting. “If you’re the one … trying to speak up about things like this, you become known as a trouble maker,” said Andi. Another worker, Joe, expressed concern about other possible repercussions such as “getting fired, getting blacklisted” and that if that happened it “means nobody will hire you again”. New Zealand’s “Hobbit Law” – lobbied for by Peter Jackson and a number of Lord of the Rings production members in 2010 – means even full-time film workers are broadly treated as independent contractors, so cannot bring grievance cases for unfair dismissal. Precarious employment can add to the intensely high-pressure, competitive environments of film sets, where the priority is completing projects on-time and on-budget. Zena Harris, the president and founder of Green Spark consultancy, said film workers “work in an environment with a very narrow focus and complete hierarchy and domination. And so they don’t have, necessarily, the freedom to speak up.” “If you go on to any production right now and spend a few minutes with the crew, they will tell you exactly what’s wrong or exactly what could be done better from a sustainability perspective – if only they had the time … had the backing of their supervisor or had a bit of budget,” says Harris. While some productions now appoint sustainability officers, crew members say they often lack authority to change practices, especially if they are not integrated from the outset. At worst, Sam says, they could become exercises in greenwashing. Workers and international experts also say those dedicated sustainability teams should be embedded from the outset of production to be effective. “Having someone responsible purely for sustainability, who’s there right from the start, should be mandatory, at least for productions of a certain size,” Ali, a worker on Rings of Power, says. The environmental impact of film productions was particularly grating for some crew members given the enormous investment by the New Zealand government. “We’re giving hundreds of millions of dollars in hard-earned tax money to these goliaths,” Andi says. “It’s our cost,” says Joe – both environmentally and financially. Linking subsidies to sustainability New Zealand has some of the most generous film subsidies in the world, underwriting up to 25 cents of every dollar spent by big in-country productions. In 2021, economic development minister Stuart Nash told parliament the government expected to fork out another $1bn over the next five years. In the case of The Rings of Power, if in-country costs reached the estimated budget of $650m, New Zealand would pay around $130m. “People are flocking to certain production hubs to film in those areas, because of the very lucrative film incentives that exist,” consultancy founder O’Brien says. “And so there’s been talk around: well, we’re already giving people a 20% or 25% rebate on their spend in these territories – what if there were also some type of incentive linked to sustainability efforts?” While they’re still rare, some incentives for improving environmental practices appear effective. Vancouver introduced a 50% discount on filming permits if productions reduced their use of diesel generators – switching instead to battery power or plugging into the grid. Harris says about 30% of productions have taken it up. Studios producing for BBC, ITV, Channel 4, UKTV, Sky, TG4 or Netflix in the UK must calculate and report their production’s carbon footprint via Albert Sustainable Production Certification. While Amazon has made its own Climate Pledge, Amazon Productions is not listed among Albert’s affiliates, and nothing similar to that certification scheme is in effect in New Zealand. New Zealand was “absolutely” lagging on developing standardised sustainability practices – around a decade behind the UK, which developed reporting structures in 2011, says Craig Gainsborough, of industry sustainability organisation Greenlit. “As a whole, our domestic industry doesn’t have any monitoring and reporting of carbon, waste, or emissions,” he says, and currently only about 5-7% of New Zealand-based productions monitor their carbon footprint. Gainsborough says while it is “easy to point the finger” at the big productions, it is New Zealand’s responsibility to create standards and meaningfully empower sustainability teams. “Those measures needed to be embedded from the outset of productions,” he says. “Individual people within the industry … care about it, but there’s no oversight.” Asked in early October about concerns about the climate or environmental impact of growing New Zealand-based film productions, the arts, culture and heritage minister, Carmel Sepuloni said: “I haven’t received any briefings recently to tell me that we’re behind or ahead [of other countries]… we as a government and also the film sector do need to be mindful of that though.” Sepuloni said the government was reviewing New Zealand’s film incentives – and she expected some people would “want to provide feedback around environmental impacts”. When the 56-page consultation document was released in late October, however, government suggestions for reform made no mention of climate change, waste disposal, emissions, incentives for sustainable productions or penalties for environmental damage. Sepuloni declined to be interviewed or respond directly to questions on the environmental impact of the Rings of Power, referring questions to the economic and regional development minister, Stuart Nash. A spokesperson for Nash’s office said in a statement that he “cannot comment on the amount of environmental waste created by an individual production” but screen production grants require recipients “to follow the laws of New Zealand”. With a review of the screen production grants under way, they said: “We welcome input on environmental sustainability. Based on public response, this may be considered as part of final advice.” Without action from government, an industry-wide commitment, or greater public pressure on the studios themselves, workers believe the status quo will continue. “The current situation is proof of that,” says Sam. “If there’s no legislation, accountability or consumer demand? Exactly nothing happens.” *All workers’ names have been changed to protect their identities"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T17:17:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Crimea navy oil depot fire ‘contained’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimea-oil-depot-on-fire-zelenskiy-condemns-absolute-evil-after-missile-strikes-kill-25","fields":{"bodyText":"Good evening that concludes our blog coverage for today, you can read all our stories on Ukraine here A huge fire in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday has been put out after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. The fire was later extinguished, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. The Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Around 190,000 Russian soldiers have died since the conflict began, according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence. A court in Russia has convicted a woman over social media posts condemning the war in Ukraine and punished her with a steep fine despite her asking for a prison sentence. Marina Novikova, a 65-year-old lawyer, was found guilty of “spreading false information” about the Russian army, which was made a criminal offence after Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine. Novikova’s posts on the messaging app Telegram decried the invasion and criticised the Russian government, Sky News reported. Prosecutors had requested a three-year prison sentence and Novikova pleaded with the court to send her to prison rather than be issued with a fine of at least 700,000 roubles (£6,900). But the court in Seversk instead imposed a fine of one million roubles (nearly £10,000), the Russian human rights and legal aid group OVD-Info quoted her husband, Alexandr Gavrik, as saying. The fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the city’s Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. Experts examined the site and “it became clear that only one drone was able to reach the oil reservoir”, Mikhail Razvozhaev said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that no one had been injured in the fire which was caused by a drone strike. Another drone was downed, its wreckage found on the shore near the terminal, Razvozhaev added, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian military intelligence official said more than 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia’s Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported. The official, Andriy Yusov, did not claim Ukraine was responsible for the explosion in comments reported by RBC, instead describing the blast as “God’s punishment” for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. “This punishment will be long-lasting. In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor’s army,” RBC quoted Yusov as saying. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces said earlier he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for the fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire that was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday has been put out after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. The fire was later extinguished, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. The Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts.

With Reuters and Agence France-Presse The American political commentator Noam Chomsky has said Russia is fighting with more restraint in Ukraine than the US and its allies did during the invasion of Iraq. In an interview with the New Statesman released on Saturday, the celebrated linguist said the destruction seen in Iraq’s capital has not been witnessed in the current conflict. He said: Undoubtedly Russia could do it, presumably with conventional weapons. It could make Kyiv as unliveable as Baghdad was, could move in to attacking supply lines in western Ukraine. Chomsky also said Britain and the US had refused peace negotiations in Ukraine, and that Washington was only supplying weapons to Kyiv in order to weaken Russia. For the US, this is a bargain. For a fraction of the colossal military budget, the US is able to severely degrade the military forces of its only real military adversary. Chomsky was challenged on his views on Ukraine in a combative interview with Times Radio host Matt Chorley earlier this week. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement posted to its Telegram channel, the embassy said it noted Martin’s comments about Cafferkey’s “clear principles”. It said: We do not know what his principles were. What we do know, though, is that in a very big way it is the Irish government and media to who bear responsibility for the death of Finbar Cafferkey. It has been the government and media who have been promoting anti-Russian propaganda, distorting the truth about the conflict in Ukraine, misleading people like Finbar Cafferkey. Commenting on Twitter, the former justice minister Charlie Flanagan said: Threatening, intimidating &amp; chilling statement by Russian embassy Dublin. These hostile remarks are unacceptable. Beyond time Ambassador Filatov &amp; his crew were asked to leave our country. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans, Agence France-Presse reports. Since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. On Friday, the Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army, a court representative told the news agency. Chernysheva, who runs a baking business, has been posting pictures of colourful cakes bearing slogans in opposition to armed conflict on Instagram, where she is followed by more than 25,000 people. She was briefly detained on Thursday after an ultra-conservative media outlet drew attention to her work in January. Other cakes, decorated with hearts and flowers, referenced pop culture or read “Love will win” or “I love you!”. Pope Francis met Ukrainians who had fled the war on Hungary’s eastern border on Saturday, telling the refugees that a different future is possible. Reuters reports: Francis met with about 600 refugees, poor and homeless people in a visit to St. Elizabeth’s church in Budapest on the second day of his visit, which began on Friday when he pointedly warned of the dangers of rising nationalism in Europe. Francis was serenaded by a singing band of Hungarian Roma wearing flower-patterned clothing and seemed to enjoy the music as they hovered around him as he sat in his wheelchair. But what Francis heard earlier was much more sober. Oleg Yakovlev told of he and his wife Lyudmila and their five children had to leave Dnipro a year ago after Russian bombings. “We were welcomed here and we have found a new home (but) many have suffered and suffer still because of the war,” Yakovlev told the pope. Sitting in the first row of the church with his family, the youngest of Yakovlev children, a boy of about four, was amused by the attention he was getting, making faces at reporters as his father spoke of missiles, crumbled buildings and a 1,500km trip to safety. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, 2022, millions of refugees have fled through Central Europe, including Hungary, and moved to other countries. About 35,000 have applied for temporary protection status in Hungary. Francis said expressing compassion for those suffering from poverty and tragedy is an integral part of being a Christian, even if those in need are non-believers. “Even amid pain and suffering, once we have received the balm of love, we find the courage needed to keep moving forward: we find the strength to believe that all is not lost, and that a different future is possible,” he said. Later the pontiff met with Metropolitan (bishop) Hilarion, representative of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Budapest. Hilarion was effectively ousted from the number two post at the ROC headquarters in Moscow last year, a decision seen as indicating discord at the top of the Russian Patriarchate over the war. The Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of the churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, which split with Western Christianity in the Great Schism of 1054. The Russian invasion of Ukraine divided world Orthodoxy and strained relations between the Vatican and the ROC. ROC Patriarch, Kirill, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kirill fully backs the war as a bulwark against a West he describes as decadent. The European Union tried to put Kirill on its sanctions list last year but member states failed to find unanimity on the issue as Hungary opposed his inclusion. Relations between the Vatican and the ROC have been frosty since Francis said last year that Kirill should not be “Putin’s altar boy”. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. AFP reports that the city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. It lies upstream on the Dnipro River from Kherson, the regional capital from which Russia withdrew last November. Novaya Kakhovka fell to Russian forces on the first day of their invasion. When a Northumberland couple opened up their village home to a Ukrainian mother and her two daughters last year, they were responding to the plight of refugees escaping the Russian invasion. Having been told no more than that this was a musical family, Sheilagh Matheson and Chris Roberts offered two bedrooms and a honky-tonk piano. Soon they found themselves arranging the loan of a Steinway upright after discovering that these children had an extraordinary musical talent – one that made passersby stop to listen at an open window. Both girls have now received scholarships to two of the UK’s foremost music schools, less than a year after fleeing their home near Kyiv to start new lives in Corbridge, not far from Newcastle. The BBC’s Ukraine correspondent, Myroslava Petsa, reports comments from Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence (GUR) that 10 tanks of petrol were destroyed in the blaze at the Sevastopol fuel depot on Saturday. A spokesperson said the fire was “God’s punishment” against Russia for the missile strikes against Ukraine on Friday that killed at least 25 people. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Reuters reports that Andreyev told the TASS news agency: Today the Polish authorities decided to take forceful action, despite the fact that this is a diplomatic building, a school building. This is an illegal action and a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. We of course will lodge a protest. The Polish state-run news channel TVP Info reported that police were present outside the school on Kieleckiej street in Warsaw on Saturday morning. The two countries’ already fraught relations have soured further over the war in Ukraine with Warsaw helping to arm Kyiv. A fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the Moscow-installed governor has said. Reuters reports that Mikhail Razvozhaev said on Telegram: Open fire was extinguished in an area of 1,000 square metres. He said earlier that no one had been injured and according to preliminary information that the depot was hit by two drones. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram that air defence and electronic warfare forces had shot down two drones over the Crimea on Saturday. He confirmed there were no casualties Russian and blamed the attacks on Ukraine. A spokesperson for Ukraine‘s armed forces said he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for Saturday’s fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot.

With Reuters and Agence France-Presse Drone footage shows the aftermath of the airstrike in Ukraine on early Friday morning that left 23 people dead and dozens more injured. The upper floor of a residential building in the central city of Uman, south of Kyiv, was struck as people slept. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned the latest “evil” Russian assault in his evening address on Friday. Ukraine‘s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it had passed notes to Polish and EU representatives describing the limits their countries had placed on Ukrainian grain imports as “categorically unacceptable”. Reuters reports that the ministry said: Such restrictions, whatever the justification for them, do not comply with the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU and the principles and norms of the EU single market. There are full legal grounds for the immediate resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural goods to Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as the continuation of unhindered exports to other EU member states. It comes a day after the European Commission said on it had reached a deal in principle to allow the transit of Ukrainian grain to resume through Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. In his evening address, AFP reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy as saying: We need to involve everyone ... to put pressure on the Russian aggressor and the terrorists who kidnapped so many of our children. The UN, many others want to do something, but so far the results have been poor. So I have appealed to the leader of China. Xi and Zelensky spoke by phone on Wednesday, the first known call between the two leaders since the start of Russia’s invasion. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the invasion. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. It says many of them have been placed in institutions and foster homes, an allegation denied by Russia, which insists it saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. Russia’s private Wagner militia, which is leading the assault on Bakhmut in Ukraine and has been active in Africa, could soon cease to exist, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said in video remarks to a blogger that were released on Friday evening. It was not immediately clear when Prigozhin had spoken and how serious he was being. He said earlier in the week he had been joking when he said his forces would stop shelling Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces to show the city to journalists. Reuters reports that he told Russian war blogger Semyon Pegov: Now, with regard to the need in general for shells at the front, what we want. Today we are coming to the point where Wagner is ending. Wagner, in a short period of time, will cease to exist. We will become history, nothing to worry about, things like this happen. Pegov posted the clip on his Telegram channel. Wagner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have popped up like mushrooms after rain,” says Maria Glazunova, who works at the Dovzhenko Centre, Kyiv’s film archive. “They are lovely places where you can drink coffee, read, and just sniff the books.” After the terrifying early months of 2022, and a brutal winter of drone attacks and blackouts, a crop of new independent bookshops is hardly what one would expect to find in the Ukrainian capital. But, in defiance of Russia’s ongoing invasion, they are springing up all around Kyiv.

The update added: There is a realistic possibility that Russia was attempting to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies recently provided to Ukraine. Russia operates an inefficient targeting process and prioritises perceived military necessity over preventing collateral damage, including civilian deaths. Video footage of the oil terminal on fire in Russian-occupied Crimea. Footage apparently taken from the scene shows large flames at the scene and thick smoke billowing into the sky, amid claims of a drone attack. Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said on his Telegram channel that 18 fire brigades were tackling the blaze on Saturday morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. We should prove that such attempts will never reach success, to block further attempts being made in the future. Yoon made the comments in a speech at Harvard University’s Kennedy School on the fifth day of a state visit to mark the 70th anniversary of the US-South Korean alliance. Yoon was asked about the possibility of South Korea providing lethal aid to Ukraine and replied: We are closely monitoring the situation that’s going on the battlefield in Ukraine and will take proper measures in order to uphold the international norms and international law. Right now we are closely monitoring the situation and we are considering various options. Joe Biden is considering visiting new Nato member Finland to coincide with the military alliance’s July summit in Lithuania, NBC News has reported, citing three US officials familiar with the discussions. The US network said the White House’s discussions of a potential visit by the US president had been ongoing for several months and remained active, according to the officials, who said no final decision had been made. Any Finland visit would be for a summit of multiple Nordic countries, not for a bilateral visit, an administration official said. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Reuters reports that firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble, searching for survivors and bodies as anxious people stood by. “My neighbours are gone. No one is left,” said Serhii Lubivskyi, 58, who survived inside a flat on the seventh floor. He was rescued by firefighters from the balcony where he escaped with his wife after the explosion blocked their front door. Officials said at least 23 civilians were killed, including four children, with an estimated 109 people living in the part of the block that was hit and 27 flats completely destroyed. Lubivskyi wept as he looked up at the smouldering gaps in the building where adjacent flats had been blasted away. An elderly woman, her daughter and two grandchildren lived on the ninth floor. They are gone. A man with his son lived on the eighth floor. They are gone. A woman with her daughter lived on the seventh floor. They are gone. A young family lived on the sixth floor, their son was lucky ... he is alive. In the south-eastern city of Dnipro, a missile killed a two-year-old child and a 31-year-old woman, said the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak. Video released by the authorities showed a blackened hole where a missile had crashed through an apartment window. Moscow claimed it had targeted locations of Ukrainian reserve troops and had struck them successfully, preventing them from reaching the front. It supplied no evidence to support this. A fuel tank was ablaze in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the governor said on Saturday. Reuters reports that the Moscow-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhaev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit.” Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has come under repeated air attacks since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Russian officials have blamed the attacks on Ukraine. The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Kyiv almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Razvozhaev said no one was hurt in Saturday’s fire. The situation is under the control of our firefighters and all operative services. Since the volume of fuel is large, it will take time to localise the fire. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton with the latest developments to bring you up to speed. A fuel tank was on fire in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit,” Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Meanwhile, five children are among the dead as the toll from Russia’s wave of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine rose to 25. Rescue workers were searching for survivors and bodies amid the smouldering rubble of a nine-storey block of flats hit in Uman, central Ukraine. The barrage of more than 20 missiles early on Friday is Russia’s first large-scale air strike in almost two months. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described Uman as “absolutely peaceful” and condemned the attacks, saying: “Only absolute evil can unleash such terror against Ukraine.” He added: “Our air force managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles – 21 out of 23. If not for this, the terrorist state would have managed to claim many more casualties, more lives.” More on those stories shortly. In other news: Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission has said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops and are ready, broadly speaking, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” President Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine.

Is America’s latest third party marching to power – or oblivion?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/forward-third-party-andrew-yang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/forward-third-party-andrew-yang","fields":{"bodyText":"After the 2020 election, Americans were clear: they wanted a viable third political party. In modern US history the country has been dominated by the Republican and Democratic parties almost to the exclusion of all others, effectively creating a near two-party monopoly on power in the White House, Congress and the state level. Other parties, like the Reform party, the Greens or the Libertarians have never really broken through. In 2021, as the fallout from the 2020 election continued, polling showed widespread support among Americans for a fresh third party that would offer something different from the status quo. Even a majority of self-identified Republicans said they wanted a new party in the mix. This should be prime ground, then, for the Forward party, founded in July by a group of self-defined centrists including the former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and former Republican New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. People wanted a new third party, and they have been given one – one that has boasted of already raising more than $5m. So what are the chances of Yang and co winning office, and holding forth on the floors of the US Capitol? “Slim to none,” says Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University Bloomington. “With an emphasis on none.” Third parties face resource problems, for one thing. Forward’s $5m pales in comparison with the $1bn Joe Biden raised from donors during his 2020 election campaign. Donald Trump raised $774m from donors, according to Open Secrets, while data from the Federal Election Commission shows that House and Senate candidates raised $4bn between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020, spending $3.8bn. The two dominant parties also have huge structural advantages: mailing lists, email addresses, existing supporters and name recognition, things that have taken decades to build. A more fundamental issue is that the US election system just isn’t set up to accommodate a third party. The first-past-the-post system, in which one person is elected in each congressional district, means that a third party could, in theory, win 49% of the vote in a given area, and it would count for nothing if their opponent wins more. Forward, which launched on 23 July, was formed from three existing political groups: Renew America Movement, made up of dozens of former Republican administration officials ; the Forward party, which was founded by Yang after his failed bid to become the Democratic party’s nominee for New York City mayor; and the Serve America Movement, a centrist group of Democrats, Republicans and independents. “The rigid, top-down, one-size-fits-all platforms of the outdated political parties are drifting toward the fringes, making solutions impossible,” Forward’s website reads. “We stand for doing, not dividing. That means rejecting the far Left and far Right and pursuing common ground.” The party’s mission: “Not left. Not right. FORWARD,” as its slogan lays out, is a noble one. But there are doubts about what a centrist party might actually look like and stand for. “There are a lot of people who would consider themselves moderate or centrist, who disagree very strongly with other people who consider themselves moderate or centrist. It’s not one group,” Hershey said. The Forward party is yet to lay out a detailed platform. But once it does set out its positions on divisive issues like abortion, social security and tax cuts, Hershey said, “some of that middle is going to disagree with other parts of that middle, and the so-called huge middle is no longer huge.” In a statement, the Forward party said it “can’t be pegged to the traditional left-right spectrum because we aren’t built like the existing parties. “The glue that holds us together is not rote ideology, it is a shared commitment to actually solving problems. The hunger for that simple but revolutionary kind of politics is immense.” In terms of how it will compete with Democrats and Republicans, the party said it “isn’t looking to drop a billion dollars in a 2024 presidential race”. Instead, it will focus on gaining ballot access and recruiting candidates to run in races across the country. “That takes money,” Forward said. “But more than money it takes people, and we are rich with them.” Forward is less than two weeks old, but has already attracted a good deal of both cynicism and criticism, not least for the false equivalency it deployed when describing the need for a third party. In an op-ed in the Washington Post titled “Most third parties have failed. Here’s why ours won’t,” Yang, Whitman and David Jolly, another co-founder who was previously a Republican congressman from Florida and executive chairman of the Serve America Movement, appeared to offer disingenuous arguments for why their efforts were required. On guns, Forward suggested that most Americans are “rightfully worried by the far right’s insistence on eliminating gun laws”, but “don’t agree with calls from the far left to confiscate all guns and repeal the Second Amendment”. As Andrew Gawthorpe, a historian of the United States at Leiden University and host of the podcast America Explained, wrote in the Guardian: “These two things are not the same: the first is what is actually happening in America right now, whereas the second is a view that was attributed to Kamala Harris as part of a fabricated smear on Facebook and enjoys approximately zero support in the Democratic party.” Third parties can have an impact, said Bernard Tamas, associate professor of political science at Valdosta state university and author of The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties: Poised for Political Revival?. But there’s usually a pretty specific formula. “It’s always built on outrage,” Tamas said. “It has to be where the public is galvanized.” Tamas pointed to the Progressive party, founded in 1912. That party, led by former president Theodore Roosevelt, advocated for child labor laws and the establishment of improved working conditions, including and eight-hour working day and “one day’s rest in seven” for workers. Roosevelt, who was shot during his campaign, won 27.4% of the vote, besting William Howard Taft, the incumbent Republican, but losing to the Democrat Woodrow Wilson. But progressive reforms were eventually introduced. “What they have historically done successfully could be described with an analogy of ‘sting like a bee’,” Tamas said. “They emerge, really often quite suddenly, and they attack the two parties [and] they effectively pull voters away from them. “And the two parties then respond, and in critical moments, they respond by trying to take away these issue bases, whatever is making the third party successful. They take those away, the major party changes, and then effectively the third party dies.” Forward, which has pledged that it will reflect “the moderate, common-sense majority”, has plenty of people skeptical as to whether it can sting like a bee – let alone do more and actually elect candidates. “The way that they’re presenting themselves, it may not have the galvanizing message,” Tamas said. “Simply saying: ‘Hey, you know, let’s all get together and work together’ is barely something that gets people running on the streets protesting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-15T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: does nuclear power really keep the lights on?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","fields":{"bodyText":"The nuclear industry is fond of telling us the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, as if people living in Britain did not already know that. But the point atomic enthusiasts are making is that wind and solar electricity generation is not reliable, while nuclear will keep the lights on. But things are a bit more complicated than that. This is partly because large-scale batteries, pump storage in reservoirs and other ways of topping up electricity supplies mean that baseload power provided by nuclear reactors is no longer needed. Another reason is that nuclear output is falling while renewables get ever stronger. Output of electricity over a year is measured in terawatt hours (TWh). In 2020, generation from nuclear was 50.3TWh, down 11% from 2019, partly because of cracks and rust in ageing reactors. Renewable output reached a record high of 120.3TWh. Significantly, 2020 nuclear generation was 13TWh less than in 1989, when nuclear provided 20% of the nation’s electricity, and wind and solar contributions were hardly measurable. Even with the massive station Hinkley Point C being built in Somerset, nuclear power is fading away. To keep the lights on we will have to increasingly learn to carefully manage the power produced by our unreliable weather."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/31/superman-kremlin-russian-red-square-reiner-riedlers-best-photograph","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T14:22:42Z","webTitle":"Superman towers over the Kremlin: Reiner Riedler’s best photograph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/31/superman-kremlin-russian-red-square-reiner-riedlers-best-photograph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/31/superman-kremlin-russian-red-square-reiner-riedlers-best-photograph","fields":{"bodyText":"This photo is part of my Fake Holidays series. At the beginning of the project, more than 15 years ago, I went to Lara Beach in Antalya, Turkey, where there is one luxury five-star hotel after another, all along the coastline. On the other side of the road were the tents of the workers who had built the hotels. Luxury hotels are like little ghettoes. You take your plane and your taxi, then you are in the middle of an isolated luxury area. The Kremlin Palace hotel, where this photo was taken, has an exact copy of Saint Basil’s Cathedral in Red Square, Moscow. I have been to Moscow and seen the original church, which is a focal point – all tourists take a picture there. But here in Turkey, there is a swimming pool in front of the cathedral. I was fascinated. There were many Russian tourists. I saw a weird guy, an astronaut, walking around the pool. “What’s happening here?” I asked. It turned out the hotel had a huge room with costumes for the entertainers who perform for the tourists. Superman was one of them. I found him by the pool and immediately asked to take his picture. I took about three shots. I chose the photo point, in front of the church with the pool between us, then asked Superman to jump. It was a very childish approach, perhaps, but he did it. The way he jumped was perfect. I felt in the moment: “That’s the picture.” It quite often happens that when I take a picture, I know it’s strong, but when I go home and look more closely, I understand its more complex meaning. This was one of those times. When I saw the image on my computer screen, I understood what it was about. There is the No 1 tourist site in Moscow, which stands for the entire history of the Russian empire, and then you have Superman on that famous square, jumping over Saint Basil’s Cathedral. It is Superman, representing American power, rising above what represents the Russian empire. It would have been impossible to take a photo like this in the real Red Square and, now, I think you would end up in prison. In 2006, it was more simply a funny image: the collision of two worlds in one picture. The Crimean crisis happened much later, in 2014, and we were a long way away from the Ukraine conflict. If I look at the picture now it has a different meaning: I relate it to the political situation nowadays and it is getting more and more interesting. I loved the image before, but some images take their time to develop their whole impact. My Fake Holidays project was inspired by seeing how many European cities were creating artificial beaches. I first came across one in Hamburg, Germany; they had put sand on the street and set up palm trees, and there was an inflatable swimming pool. I took off my shoes and put my feet into the sand. I felt immediately transported – just touching the sand reminded me of beach holidays when I was a child. I was fascinated by the idea that we can be so easily manipulated by our surroundings. There’s a whole industry doing it, like Disney – the mother of all leisure parks. I took photographs all over Europe, China, the United States, Japan … I was fascinated by the facades of happiness. In my heart, I still feel like a documentary photographer. I am reflecting what I see with my photographs. The representation of reality with photography is a beautiful idea, but photography is changing a lot these days. We have artificial intelligence. Last month, an AI image was selected for the first time for a photo contest. But the most beautiful thing with photography is that reality is so strong.

It’s been a free republic for more than 30 years, long enough for the first generation of Ukrainians born since independence to have school-age children of their own. It’s had seven different leaders, all of them still alive. It would be sentimental – and patronising – to talk about a country having “grown up”. But 30 years is long enough for countries to change, for better or for worse; long enough for countries to have eras. Ukraine was well into its second era, its European era, when Putin invaded last month. Putin never accepted the right of post-Soviet Ukraine to exist in independent Ukraine’s first era. In terms of understanding the country, that’s the period he’s stuck in; Putin doesn’t acknowledge that a second era began. The west shares many of the Kremlin’s misapprehensions about Ukraine. We are still too ready to see the country through the cliche of a “nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking” west and a “Russia-friendly, Russian-speaking” south and east. Or, more crudely and colourfully, neo-communist miners in the east, neo-Nazis in the west. Of course it was never that simple, even in post-Soviet Ukraine. But European-era Ukraine, which emerged in 2014, overturned its own political fundamentals. Faced with an existential struggle against a powerful, ruthless neighbour, Russia, where nationalism now serves autocracy, an emergent class of Ukrainian liberals made common cause with Ukrainian nationalists. It’s been an uncomfortable alliance but it has kept the country together. As Ukraine defends itself against Putin’s terror campaign, mutually estranged liberals and nationalists in other countries – the US, England, France – would do well to watch. To talk about “European Ukraine” isn’t to describe an achieved state but a state of hope: hope of membership in the European Union – more meaningful to Ukraine, at least until Russia attacked, than membership of Nato. Ukraine’s hope of Europe had its material side, a hope of grants, jobs and trade. Since the “revolution of dignity” – also known as “Maidan” – in 2014, trade with the EU soared while trade with Russia plunged. More than a million Ukrainians went to work, legally or otherwise, in the EU. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, much has been made in Britain of the EU’s openness to Ukrainian refugees compared with the barriers put up by London. But it’s a depressing reflection of how mainstream anti-immigrant assumptions have become in the UK that virtually no one in Britain is aware the EU gave Ukrainians visa-free access years ago, as a reward for their country’s sacrifices in Europe’s name. Since 2017, as a result of that and of Brexit, Ukrainians have levelled up and Britons levelled down to identical rights of EU entry: 90 days’ stay without a visa. Beyond the material hopes of European-era Ukraine, there is the prospect, less tangible and more powerful, of an alternative form of nationhood. Rather than the archaic, romantic, racial mystifications of old Ukrainian nationalism, or Putin’s neo-imperial vision of Ukraine pulverised and remade as a puppet state to serve Russian nationalism, it’s of Ukraine pursuing its free course as an equal member of a self-constraining, self-governing association of countries, the EU. The beauty of the EU, for Ukraine, is the capaciousness of its model for both liberals and nationalists. In some ways, the aims of European-era Ukraine closely resemble those of the Scottish National party and the Irish republic: to use the economic power of the EU to leverage their own, to break out of the orbit of a delusional post-imperial culture, to find national self-determination by accepting multinational rules. As Tom Nairn wrote of Scotland, a country could aspire to “a new interdependence where our nationhood will count, rather than towards mere isolation”. For Ukraine’s more conservative nationalists, it’s Poland and Hungary that offer the more appealing EU models – stridently patriotic, subordinating media, courts and education to national ideals and social conservatism, all while getting subsidies and trading freely within the EU. The prelude to Ukraine’s European era occurred in 2013 under president Viktor Yanukovych, a profoundly corrupt politician from the east of the country. Although seen as a proxy for Kremlin interests, and generally loyal to the idea of post-Soviet Ukraine as a Russian client state, he threw his weight behind an association agreement with the EU. He had his country on side, but Putin gave it to be understood that he considered it a betrayal – Ukraine could partner with the EU or Russia, not both. Whether Yanukovych was genuinely up for the deal with Brussels, or simply angling for a bigger bung from Moscow, he changed his mind at the last minute, took a large loan from Putin and turned his back on the EU. It was November. Protests began in Kyiv against abandonment of the EU deal. There were calls for Yanukovych to resign. Small, peaceful protests were put down violently by the police. Parliament, then controlled by Yanukovych allies, passed repressive laws against free speech and gatherings. As 2013 passed into 2014, the protests grew, their demands expanded and their base spread. Opposition to Yanukovych and calls for deeper ties to Europe evolved into attacks on the entire corrupt, oligarchic system of business and government. Young members of the liberal intelligentsia were joined by radical nationalist groups, by small-business owners and by factory workers. Opposition MPs aligned themselves with the protesters. Increasingly violent street battles were waged around Kyiv’s central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Barricades went up. Weapons escalated from clubs and stones and shields to molotov cocktails, to stun grenades and rubber bullets, to actual bullets. Some police were shot; more than 100 protesters were killed. In the third week of February, for reasons still mysterious – perhaps because the security forces ceased to believe in the president – the regime collapsed. European foreign ministers brokered a peace deal with Yanukovych, the Maidan crowd refused to accept it, and Yanukovych fled the country. Parliament voted in an interim government and prepared for new elections. Barely had the revolutionaries’ victory sunk in before Russia annexed Crimea in a nearly bloodless coup de main. In Yanukovych’s home region of Donbas, on the border with Russia, locals angry at the treatment of their lawfully elected president seized administrative buildings. They were quickly ousted, only to be replaced, in April, by a new wave of rebels helped by volunteers from Russia. Fighting escalated to a full-scale war, culminating in incursions by regular Russian troops. Thousands of people were killed. By 2015, the front lines had stabilised and fighting lessened, with part of Donbas under joint Russian-rebel control. The rest of Ukraine was at peace. In 2017, the association agreement with the EU came into force. Even before the war in the Donbas began, there were warnings of what the longer term held. In what reads now as an astonishingly accurate forecast of what was to come, in an interview with a Ukrainian paper in March 2014, the former Putin adviser Andrei Illarionov spelled it out, failing only to predict that eight years would pass first. “There’s an aim and a plan to attack Ukraine which was put together years ago,” he said. It has many different elements … Crimea, the south-east and, of course, a change of power in Kyiv. And then there are other things: a new [Ukrainian] constitution, to be written in the Kremlin, disarmament of the Ukrainian people, liquidation of Maidan, and so on.” “Liquidation of Maidan” sounds different from the current Kremlin programme, until you realise this is simply “denazification” by another name. * * * It might seem trivial now, when Ukraine is on fire and hundreds are being killed every day, when all that seems important is how many Russian tanks and planes and soldiers the Ukrainians have to blow up to make Putin stop, to talk about abstractions like nationalism and liberalism. And yet without these forces coming together over the past seven years of semi-peace, would Ukraine have held out this long? I remember being surprised, when I visited Kyiv at the end of February 2014, to see how focused liberals and nationalists alike were on a European future. The spokesman for one of the most notorious radical nationalist groups, Right Sector, talked to me about Poland as a model for the country. European flags were everywhere. I went for dinner one evening with a friend of a friend, a successful businesswoman. The Maidan was very localised; a huge encampment of brown tents crowded together, wreathed in the smoke of hundreds of stoves, in which exhausted people, who had fought nightly battles in freezing conditions, lived difficult lives away from home. But right next door to it were expensive restaurants with waiters in spotless white shirts serving fine wines and tuna carpaccio. “You know, the nationalists were very important,” said the businesswoman, sipping her grenache. “They did very good work at the leading edge.” I’ve always been in two minds about that conversation with someone who had been very kind to me. On the one hand, it had that air of somebody being grateful that somebody else was doing their dirty work; that one person had education, good taste and proper gentle sentiments, and they were grateful that their interests were being protected by another person who risked their life with a petrol bomb and a brick, and whose most conservative, chauvinist views the first person would definitely not want to hear at their dinner table in peacetime. On the other hand, my friend’s friend was being honest about the realities of a dangerous situation, and resistance towards a nasty, increasingly repressive regime: that she was not one of nature’s fighters, and she was glad to have people prepared to fight for their country on her side. “Nationalist” and “liberal”, after all, are words with an extremely broad range of meanings. “For me, ‘national’ is what allows me to defend Ukraine as an independent, sovereign nation,” said the Ukrainian philosopher Evhen Bistritsky in 2018, at a time when disillusionment with Ukraine’s post-Maidan failures to get to grips with corruption and institutional inertia was running deep. “I am a liberal, defending the independence of Ukraine. Part of Ukrainian society supports conservative values, linking them to security. If we’re really only going to preach universal, classical, liberal values … we promote discord in the country.” In a country not fighting for its existence, in the US, perhaps, or Britain, or France, in some safe part of the EU, such language would have marked Bistritsky out as a centrist, a moderate, even, more pejoratively, an undemocratic compromiser. In the present Ukrainian context, faced with the Russian killing machine, “discord” becomes “failure to fill the ranks”. Recently the Ukrainian writer Artem Chekh published Absolute Zero, his memoir of service in the Ukrainian army on the Donbas front in 2015. In it he faces up to the strangeness of being a liberal, cosmopolitan, intellectual man serving alongside workers and farmers who see the world in patriotic, if cynical, absolutes. I went around to his flat in Kyiv a few weeks ago for coffee and cake. Now he has taken up a gun again to protect the city against the invader. In an article for the London Review of Books blog, he lists his comrades: “a music producer, an owner of a household chemicals store, a teacher, an artist, a bank clerk, a former investigator, a doctor. The ability to write, paint, act, play a musical instrument or dance doesn’t matter now.

Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw by President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Poland would send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. Poland has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, met Russian officials in Kaliningrad on Wednesday for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland on Wednesday, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting on Wednesday evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. France’s president Emmanuel Macron has warned that anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. It would be “very hard” to lift Russia’s suspension from UEFA until the war in Ukraine ends, the president of the European football governing body has said. Aleksander Čeferin, at a news conference in Lisbon, said: My personal opinion is: that, until the war stops, it will be very hard for us to change anything. Both UEFA and world football’s governing body, FIFA, suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions in February 2022. Footage being shared on social media shows a small plume of black smoke rising from the Russian defence ministry’s headquarters following state media reports that a fire has broken out at the building in the centre of Moscow. There have been no details on any casualties or the cause of the fire. A fire has broken out at a building belonging to Russia’s defence ministry in the centre of Moscow, the Russian state-run Tass new agency is reporting, citing emergency services. More details to follow. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s official visit to Poland. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, has arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting this evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The pair will also discuss “the international situation and the measures being taken to ensure security”, Belta said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. Moscow and Beijing issued the joint statement following talks between Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the Russian capital last month. In the statement, both countries said it was necessary to halt actions that further fuelled the conflict in Ukraine. Just days later, Putin said Moscow had reached an agreement with Minsk to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters at Nato’s headquarters in Brussels today, said the Russian leader’s announcement followed Moscow and Beijing jointly declaring countries should not deploy nuclear weapons outside their borders. He said this showed such statements are “empty promises and what we need to watch closely is what Russia is doing”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Poland for an official visit to a close ally that has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed by President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle.

The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainian grain until June 2024. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s state-run RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. The United States is working through the process to determine if Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich’s detention by Russia is “wrongful”, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, adding that it would soon be completed. “It’s something that we’re working through very deliberately, but expeditiously as well. And I’ll let that process play out. In my own mind, there’s no doubt that he’s being wrongfully detained by Russia,” Reuters reports Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that explosions have been heard in Kherson. US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Wednesday she had spoken with her Russian counterpart Vassily Nebenzia to demand the immediate release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week. Reuters reports Thomas-Greenfield said she spoke with Nebenzia on Tuesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. He said: We are in Bakhmut and the enemy does not control it. He added: For me, the most important is not to lose our soldiers and of course if there is a moment of even hotter events and the danger we could lose our personnel because of encirclement – of course the corresponding correct decisions will be taken by generals there. The more ammunition Kyiv receives from western partners, the faster it would be able fight back in Bakhmut and elsewhere, he added: There is success in some districts of Bakhmut – we’re going forward. Or there’s no (success) and we’re again leaving for positions. Vladimir Putin has attended a ceremony at the Kremlin where he met the new ambassadors to Moscow and accepted their diplomatic credentials. Among the 17 new ambassadors attending the ceremony on Wednesday was Lynne Tracy, the US’s new ambassador to Russia. Putin told Tracy in an address that US support for a revolution in Ukraine in 2014 had led to the current situation where Russia and Ukraine were in conflict. Relations with Washington were in a deep crisis that was “based on fundamentally different approaches to the formation of the modern world order”, the Russian leader said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has met Russian officials in Kaliningrad for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. An IAEA spokesperson said earlier this week that Grossi would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday to discuss the safety of the nuclear plant, which is near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Here’s more from Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who said he would discuss developments in the Ukraine war with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to Turkey this week. Ankara is working with the UN to solve issues regarding grain and fertiliser exports via the Black Sea, Çavuşoğlu added. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Poland for an official visit to a close ally that has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw with military honours, tributes and praise from President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Duda told Zelenskiy that he was a“unique man” and that he had “no doubt that your attitude, together with the bravery of the nation, has saved Ukraine”. Poland will send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy: Four MiG-29s that remained in storage have been handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces in recent months. Four MiGs are now being given, so eight in total.. We are ready... to give six more that are currently being prepared. We assume they could be transferred soon. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. He said: You have not abandoned Ukraine, you stood with us shoulder to shoulder, and we are grateful to you. We believe this is a historic relationship. The visit – Zelenskiy’s first official visit to Poland since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 – stood out from his previous visits to the US, Britain, France and Belgium because it was announced in advance, without the secrecy of past trips. It is also unusual because the Ukrainian president is joined by his wife. Poland has taken in more than a million Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded, and has played an instrumental role in persuading other western powers to supply battle tanks and other weaponry to Ukraine. It was also the first country to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine. During his visit, Zelenskiy is expected to meet with Duda and Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and sign bilateral agreements. Polish officials had previously said talks would focus on developments on the Ukrainian front lines, international support and economic cooperation. Zelenskiy will also speak to Ukrainian refugees and Polish members of the public as well as business leaders who could be involved in rebuilding Ukraine. Here’s more from President Emmanuel Macron, who has arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit. Speaking to journalists, the French leader said anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. Macron said: We have decided since the beginning of the conflict to help the victim, and we have also made it very clear that anyone helping the aggressor would be an accomplice in breach of international law. He added that it was not in China’s interest to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine: China’s interest isn’t to have a lasting war. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has awarded his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the Order of the White Eagle during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Warsaw. The order is “the oldest and highest Polish award” and is presented to “outstanding individuals,” Duda said at the ceremony. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said Sweden needs to take further steps for Ankara to ratify its Nato membership bid. Çavuşoğlu also told reporters that he had discussed Sweden’s Nato bid and developments regarding Ankara’s purchase of F-16 fighter jets with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Çavuşoğlu and Blinken met on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, on the day that Finland formally joined the military alliance. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said China can play a “major role” in the war in Ukraine because of its close relationship with Russia. Macron, speaking shortly after he landed in Beijing for a state visit, said maintaining dialogue with China was essential and that Moscow could not be allowed to have an exclusive dialogue with Beijing. He told reporters at the French embassy in Beijing: We hear increasingly loud voices expressing a strong concern about the future of relations between the west and China that in some form lead to the conclusion that there is an inescapable spiral of mounting tensions. The French leader, who touched down ahead of the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is on his first trip to China since 2019 and hopes to refute any sense of an “inescapable spiral” of tension between Beijing and the west. Both Macron and Von der Leyen have said they want to persuade China to use its influence over Russia to bring peace in Ukraine, or at least prevent Beijing from directly supporting Moscow.

The first images have arrived of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Warsaw where he and his wife, Olena Zelenska, have met Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and his wife, Agata Kornhauser-Duda. Turkish coastguards were searching for nine missing crew members of a Ukraine-bound commercial ship that sank close to Turkey’s southern province of Antalya. The Guinea Bissau-flagged ship had sailed from Turkey’s Iskenderun port for Ukraine’s Izmail port, the coast guard said. Reuters report five crew members were rescued by helicopters and other ships passing by the area, it said in a statement. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. Spain last month said it expected to send the tanks after the 9 April Easter holiday. It had committed to sending a total of ten tanks to Ukraine, and Reuters reports Robles said the armed forces had started repairing the remaining four. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. “As it is clear that this demand will not be met by the European Commission at this point, I decided to resign from the post of agriculture minister,” Kowalczk said. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. Reuters reports the prime ministers of five states including Poland wrote to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday to demand action on Ukrainian agricultural imports. They said tariffs may have to be reintroduced if the influx of grain and other products from Ukraine cannot be stopped by other means. Reuters has a quick snap to report that Polish agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk will resign from his post amid rising anger among farmers over the impact of Ukrainian grain imports on prices. The move coincides with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visiting Poland, a trip which some farmers have threatened to disrupt. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing Ukrainian troops in Donetsk oblast. French president Emmanuel Macron is currently arriving at Beijing airport for his state visit to China. The UK’s Ministry of Defence’s intelligence briefing about the Ukraine war today concentrates on the finances of the Russian state. The UK suggests that Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin’s recent announcement that “a move to issuing some of Russia’s sovereign debt in foreign currencies was ‘under development’” indicates that Russia is anticipating financial support from other countries, which could go to help support the war effort. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday at the Nato summit in Brussels that the defence alliance needs to strengthen its relations with global like-minded partners. After Finland joined Nato yesterday, the Nato summit in Vilnius in July should welcome Sweden to the alliance, Reuters reports Baerbock added.

The regional authority in Ukraine’s Sumy oblast has reported that the night passed without any shelling, according to Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster. After more than 1,200 days in charge of the European Commission, which forms and enforces policy for 450 million Europeans, Ursula von der Leyen is in the final third of her term. It has been a tumultuous period: she took office in 2019 with ambitious pledges to tackle the climate emergency, but was soon confronted by a once-a-century pandemic and the biggest war on European soil since 1945. In previous crises “the EU realised that it is still very much a legislative machine, and there was no headquarters, no general to lead the crisis management”, said one senior EU official. “Now in two consecutive crises, Covid and Ukraine, we have the headquarters and we have the general.” As Von der Leyen heads to China, read our profile of the EU Commission president: A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. According to the Russian military officer cited by RIA, a Polish-made drone weighing more than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) had crashed near the plant. The news agency did not say when. Grossi has been pushing for a demilitarised zone around Europe’s largest nuclear facility, which has come under repeated shelling, with Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has crossed the border and is now in Poland ahead of his official visit to the capital Warsaw, the Polish president’s foreign policy adviser said on Wednesday. “I can say that President Zelenskiy has crossed the Polish border,” Marcin Przydacz told private broadcaster TVN24. We’ll have more shortly. More now on Zelenskiy’s trip to Poland: The Polish public overwhelming supports Ukrainians in their war with Russia. An Ipsos poll said 82% of Poles think Nato and EU countries should back Ukraine until it wins. Nonetheless, Zelenskiy’s visit takes place amid mounting anger in rural Poland over the impact of imports of Ukrainian grain, which have pushed down prices in several states in the EU’s eastern wing. “During talks with President Zelenskiy, we will certainly discuss Ukrainian grain and various agricultural products, because we want any trade with Ukraine not to destabilise our market,” Morawiecki said. Tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural imports may need to be reintroduced if an influx of products pushing down prices in EU markets can’t be halted by other means, the premiers of five eastern states said in a letter published on Friday to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Washington unveiled $2.6bn more in military assistance for Zelenskiy’s government on Tuesday, including three air surveillance radars, anti-tank rockets and fuel trucks. The Russian embassy in Washington reacted to the announcement by accusing the United States of wanting to drag out the conflict as long as possible, Russian news agency TASS said. The United States has pledged more than $35.2bn worth of security assistance since the start of the war. European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron land in China today, where they will be hoping to “reset” ties with an important economic partner while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. Macron last visited China in 2019 while it will be Von der Leyen’s first trip since becoming European Commission president that year. Since then, China’s strict pandemic controls forced all diplomatic meetings online as relations with Europe soured: first due to a stalled investment pact in 2021 and then Beijing’s refusal to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Macron’s adviser said was an attempt to “reset” diplomatic and economic relations with China. “It’s not the time to announce business deals or big new investments,” said Noah Barkin, an analyst with Rhodium Group. “It would essentially be a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy and send the message that France is not on board with the US approach.” Von der Leyen has said the EU must cut risks in ties with Beijing, including limiting Chinese access to sensitive technology and reducing reliance for key inputs such as critical minerals, as well as batteries, solar panels and other clean tech products. Macron invited Von der Leyen on the trip as a way to project European unity, after French officials criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for going solo to China late last year. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. “The visit will take place at the invitation of President (Andrzej) Duda. There will be long, broad talks, not only about the security situation, but also about economic and political support”, Przydacz told private radio RMF. “It will be an official visit.” He added Zelenskiy would meet Poles and Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Poland on Wednesday at Warsaw’s Castle square. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. Poland is Ukraine’s neighbour and the two countries have deep historical ties. Many Ukrainians fled their country after Russia’s invasion last year, with a large number seeking safety in Poland. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. French president Emmanuel Macron and European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen arrive in China on Wednesday seeking to “reset” ties while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday held a call with Macron to discuss the visit, the White House said, adding that they also spoke about maintaining support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Here are the other key recent developments: Finland has become the 31st member of Nato after its foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, signed an accession document and handed it to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, at a ceremony in Brussels. Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, said the accession of Finland increased the risks of wider conflict. US president Joe Biden welcomed Finlands’ ascension and urged Turkey and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes for Sweden to join. Ukraine hopes to receive two more tranches worth $1.8bn from the International Monetary Fund this year under its newly approved four-year lending program, top Ukrainian central bank officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine this week received the first $2.7bn tranche under the program, which is a part of a bigger $115bn global package of support. Britain has blocked the UN webcast of an informal Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, at which Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights is due to speak. The international criminal court wants to arrest the commissioner on war crimes charges. Such meetings are not held in the Security Council chamber and all 15 council members have to agree to allow it to be webcast by the United Nations. The US is trying to wreck Russia’s planned summit with African countries as part of efforts to isolate Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Moscow is preparing for its second summit with African countries, scheduled for the end of July in St Petersburg. A Ukrainian soldier pleaded “partly guilty” on Tuesday at Russia’s first trial for war crimes in connection with its military campaign in Ukraine. Russian investigators formally charged Darya Trepova, a 26-year-old woman, with terrorism offences over the killing of the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a bomb blast in St Petersburg. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week, met his lawyers for the first time on Tuesday, editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a message to staff. “Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, will travel to Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has said. Lithuania’s parliament decided on Tuesday to ban Russian nationals from purchasing real estate in the Baltic country, citing risks to national security. Polish farmers are threatening to derail a visit to Warsaw by Volodymyr Zelenskiy over claims that Ukrainian grain is flooding their market, in a move that would provide Russia with valuable evidence of a crack in western solidarity. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency has reported that the number of people injured in the St Petersburg cafe explosion that killed the prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has risen to 40."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/could-a-donald-trump-shaped-torpedo-sink-australias-368bn-aukus-submarine-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"Could a Donald Trump-shaped torpedo sink Australia’s $368bn Aukus submarine plans?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/could-a-donald-trump-shaped-torpedo-sink-australias-368bn-aukus-submarine-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/could-a-donald-trump-shaped-torpedo-sink-australias-368bn-aukus-submarine-plans","fields":{"bodyText":"On a day of hoopla surrounding the Aukus unveiling in San Diego, perhaps the most revealing moment occurred during a press conference 12,000km away in Canberra. Given that Australia’s multi-decade plan to gain nuclear-powered submarines will require the support of successive US administrations, a reporter asked the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, a very direct question on Tuesday: “Are you concerned that a future US president will tear it up?” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The answer was not immediate. He took a deep breath and paused for eight seconds before settling on the response: “Well – I’m not – is the answer to your question.” Perhaps it was just the fact that Marles was up before the crack of dawn to sell a project that carries the eye-watering price tag of as much as $368bn between now and the 2050s. But the pause seemed to betray an understanding of just one of many risks surrounding the Aukus gambit, which also requires ongoing British support under the three-country deal. Marles is a strong supporter of the US alliance – and is no “Manchurian candidate” as he was cartoonishly portrayed before the 2022 election – but he is on the record as having aired some concerns in the past about the superpower’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific. It was not just an increasingly assertive China that was fuelling the most challenging strategic outlook for Australia since the second world war, Marles wrote in his 2021 book, Tides That Bind. It was also an “unpredictable” US, he wrote then, that posed difficulties for its allies in the region. “There is a question mark over the future role of the US both in East Asia and globally,” Marles wrote. That followed a tumultuous period marked by Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, in which the then US president was openly sceptical of alliances and demanded Japan and South Korea shoulder more of the burden. Trump also abandoned a key regional trade agreement, which would have been a signal of enduring American economic engagement with the region. That deal, known then as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was meant to set the “rules of the road” rather than leaving it to China to do so; now China wants to join the rebadged CPTPP. Fast forward to today, and Marles is now the deputy prime minister and defence minister in an Australian Labor government that is making a big bet in the face of that uncertainty. He is reassured by the approach taken by Joe Biden’s administration – but maybe the only sure thing in Aukus is that it will reach its peak in the post-Biden era. Marles told reporters on Tuesday the US alliance had “thrived under successive administrations and governments” and he believed Aukus would similarly be “an enduring arrangement”. Citing strong support in the US congress, he added: “Across the political spectrum, there is complete support for the relationship with Australia and the Aukus arrangements, so we enter this with a high degree of confidence.” In an attempt to put that enduring commitment beyond doubt, Australia has agreed to sling a few billion dollars towards the US over the next four years to prop up its already strained production capacity. This could well be politically unpalatable at a time of budget pressures, but Canberra considers this a necessary downpayment towards the US being prepared to sell at least three (and as many as five) of its Virginia class submarines to Australia in the 2030s. Still, it is not hard to imagine a future president – Trump or otherwise – rethinking that sale on the basis of prioritising US needs above those of Australia. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in San Diego alongside Biden, and the UK’s Rishi Sunak, all three surrounded by their flags. In the meantime, work will begin to prepare the Osborne shipyard in South Australia for the massive undertaking of building a British-designed submarine featuring US tech, as the longer term solution. Construction is meant to start by the end of this decade, but the first of these Australian-built boats is not likely to be ready for the Royal Australian Navy until the 2040s onwards. The Australian government was out and about on Tuesday promoting the opportunities created by Aukus: potentially thousands of jobs in the long term, a boost to science and tech knowhow, and the revival of domestic manufacturing. These could well be significant. But the security partnership is also full of risks. The first relates to the cost. The forecast range of $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s is a cumulative bill for the entire program – including building up the facilities in Australia, buying the Virginia class subs, building the next-generation British designed submarine, and sustaining them all. Most of this spending is beyond the first four-year budget period, and the government plays down the cost by saying it equates to 0.15% of gross domestic product a year on average. This submarine program cost is a subset of a Labor pledge to spend, overall, at least 2% of GDP on defence each year. But history tells us the cost of defence acquisitions only ever goes up. Another risk surrounds the technical complexity of the project, and whether Australia will face difficulties recruiting and training up the naval personnel, other supporting workers and nuclear specialists who will be required to make it a success (and operate the boats safely). Going for a new design is also inherently risky – although the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said on Tuesday the government had sought to reduce that risk by having a delay of a few years between the first submarine entering into the UK’s service and the first one being handed over to the Australian navy. That is a long way off, so the US and the UK will start rotational deployments of their nuclear-powered submarines to Western Australia from 2027. This will not technically be classified as a “foreign base”, because these submarines are not there permanently, but will be a very visible sign to the region of Aukus ramping up. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Aukus is the long-term call Australia has made about the strategic circumstances and the intentions of the Chinese government. The Australian government has been unequivocal that the Australian submarines will be under Australia’s command and control – and only deployed based on sovereign decisions in Canberra. But there is no getting away from the fact Australia will be dependent on the US and the UK for key technology required to make the deal work, and the three countries will be increasingly integrated in their operations. Aukus reflects the bipartisan consensus between the major Australian political parties that the much bigger risk involves China’s military buildup and intentions, most sharply related to the future of democratically governed Taiwan. Australia is betting (or hoping) that the Aukus deal will contribute to a maintaining “strategic equilibrium” that will deter Beijing from launching military action to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The calculation is that such military action would be highly destructive to the region as a whole."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/02/if-you-cant-simply-stop-being-poor-try-some-of-these-power-saving-life-hacks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T04:19:01Z","webTitle":"If you can’t simply stop being poor try some of these power saving LIFE HACKS!! | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/if-you-cant-simply-stop-being-poor-try-some-of-these-power-saving-life-hacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/if-you-cant-simply-stop-being-poor-try-some-of-these-power-saving-life-hacks","fields":{"bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/08/queen-matriarch-power-elizabeth-ii","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T17:53:55Z","webTitle":"The Queen was the ultimate matriarch, with a power exercised quietly and artfully | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/08/queen-matriarch-power-elizabeth-ii","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/08/queen-matriarch-power-elizabeth-ii","fields":{"bodyText":"Stop all the clocks. Cut off the telephone. For once, the opening lines of WH Auden’s poem Funeral Blues seem to fit the moment. Like it or not, much of public life will grind to a halt in the black-tied days of mourning ahead, as broadcasters suspend their schedules and a state funeral is prepared. However long it may have been gently anticipated, the death of the longest reigning monarch in British history is a significant and unsettling moment in a nation’s life. And never more so, perhaps, than when it coincides with the arrival of a new prime minister amid an emerging economic crisis. There was something terribly poignant about her insistence, even in what we know now were her dying days, on personally ushering Liz Truss into office. The Queen has been a constant, steadying presence in the background of millions of lives for 70 years, a reassuring voice in troubled times. But it is the depth of knowledge accumulated over decades that may perhaps only be fully appreciated now. That benign, grandmotherly manner belied a keen and occasionally caustic intelligence. Hers was a form of female power exercised so artfully as to be almost invisible. The sweeping nature of the constitutional powers she held – to dissolve parliament, or withhold consent from legislation – were tolerated within a modern democracy precisely because they were sparingly used. She helped shape and guide governments through her weekly audiences with 14 previous prime ministers, who all took their turn at stepping gingerly past the sleeping corgis lining the way to her study at Buckingham Palace. But her political leanings went with her to the grave. The closest she perhaps strayed to expressing an opinion publicly was during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign, when she told well-wishers outside a church service that Scots should think very carefully about their vote. Even then, the palace was furious when David Cameron was overheard revealing that she had “purred down the line” when told that Scotland had voted to stay. The Queen pulled off the rare trick for a woman of exercising profound influence without inciting a backlash, in part because the scope of that influence remained so shrouded in mystery. She did not so much normalise the idea of a woman in charge as make the nation largely forget that that was what she was, while retaining the ability to freeze grown men with a look. As Tony Blair noted in his autobiography, describing a G8 summit dinner of world leaders where some were evidently fooled by the relaxed atmosphere: “You don’t get matey with the Queen. Occasionally she can be matey with you, but don’t try to reciprocate, or you get The Look.” The actor Olivia Colman, who played Elizabeth II in the Netflix series The Crown, once called her the “ultimate feminist”. But you suspect the Queen would never have claimed such a thing for herself, even if it is her face on all the money. There is more to feminism than being a woman who exercises power, and while she approved legal changes preventing future monarchs’ firstborn daughters being leapfrogged by their younger brothers in the line of succession, she did not obviously strive to leave a legacy for women. When she made a point of her gender – as she rather fabulously did in 1998, electing to chauffeur the visiting Saudi crown prince around the Balmoral estate personally in her Land Rover at a time when Saudi women were not allowed to drive – the gesture of female solidarity was all the more striking for being so rare. She treated feminism largely as a political issue on which she remained neutral, while granting her daughter-in-law Camilla intriguing licence in recent years to speak out on issues such as domestic abuse or the normalisation of sexual violence against women. But if she was no feminist icon, she became perhaps the ultimate matriarch, a word denoting not merely a position within the family but a very specific life stage. Matriarchal power is the kind exercised by older women who have managed to become valued for their wisdom and experience, not overlooked once their youth fades; who have arguably earned the right to please themselves, yet choose to offer comfort and counsel to younger generations. A true matriarch is formidable, yet mature enough to put petty vanity aside. The monarch’s role as defined by the Victorian constitutional expert Walter Bagehot – to encourage and to warn her government, while having the grace not to enforce her views – could have been written for a matriarch. But if the Queen’s power lay in what her daughter, Princess Anne, once called her pragmatism, the new king may prove rather less inscrutable. Perhaps that represents a movement with the times. The Queen’s iron sense of duty and emotionally contained manner resonated deeply with older generations, but younger ones increasingly see the suppression of feelings as unhealthy. Her apparent reluctance to emote publicly over the death of her daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales marked one of the few times the monarch seemed out of step with her country, while the memory of her young grandsons walking publicly behind their mother’s coffin still reverberates uneasily down the years. The younger of them, Prince Harry, would later renounce a conventional royal life, moving to California in 2020 with his new wife, Meghan, and baby son. When he talked earnestly of wanting to “break the cycle” as a father, some heard a veiled repudiation of the way generations of royals were raised, being cared for by nannies and then dispatched to boarding school. In his biography of Prince Charles, Jonathan Dimbleby described the Queen as a “not indifferent so much as detached” mother. But if she could sometimes seem distant when her children were small, she may have felt she had little choice. Princess Elizabeth was only 25, and her children Charles and Anne three and one respectively, when her father’s death in 1952 catapulted her into the all-consuming role for which she had been groomed since childhood, but never expected to assume so soon. Any private maternal regret over those early years of weighty expectations and long overseas trips perhaps expressed itself in her determination to let Prince William enjoy time with his young children before assuming the working load of a future heir, and in her evident delight in her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Queen had grown obviously frail of late, particularly after the death of her beloved Duke of Edinburgh, yet the sense of time running out if anything intensified her moral authority. Advised by doctors to rest rather than attend the Cop26 climate conference in 2021, there was a quiet urgency to the video message she sent in her place. “We none of us live for ever,” she said, a photograph of her late husband beside her. “But we are doing this not for ourselves, but for our children and our children’s children.” Stop the clocks indeed. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If nothing else, his documentary makes a persuasive and powerful case against climate crisis fatigue: the helpless feeling that whatever you can do as an individual is too little, too late; and besides what’s the point when it’s fossil fuel companies driving the crisis? In County Durham, he joins locals who have been fighting off plans for a new open-cast coal mine in the gorgeous countryside of the Pont Valley for decades. He arrives as they mount a last-ditch battle, occupying the valley in a makeshift camp. The mining company needs to build an access road before its licence expires. The clock is ticking. Meanwhile, over in western Germany, Felgate visits one of Europe’s biggest opencast mines in the ancient Hambach forest. Campaigners have built a community of tree houses to protect the remaining 10% of trees (being high up makes it harder for police to evict them). It’s genuinely shocking seeing the results of open-cast mining, which involves digging up the earth’s surface to reach relatively shallow seams of coal. The landscape is left apocalyptically barren, dead-looking. Back in County Durham, there’s jubilation at the discovery of an endangered crested newt, which is protected by law. That should put a stop to the mine. Not so fast, says a seasoned activist, jaded by experience: “The legal system privileges those who can pay for expensive lawyers.” I hope it’s not a spoiler to say that the film ends happily all round; though still, there’s a gnawing sense of hopelessness.

Michelle O’Neill, the party’s first minister-designate, told Heaton-Harris on Thursday that the British government should stop “pandering” to the DUP, which has paralysed power-sharing in protest against the Northern Ireland protocol. “There must be a deal. We must find a way forward,” O’Neill said after meeting Heaton-Harris on his first visit to Northern Ireland since Liz Truss, the prime minister, appointed him on Tuesday. “My focus, and I suppose my message, to the new secretary of state this morning was very clear: it’s get down to business; work with others, find an agreed way forward,” said O’Neill. “Bring that certainty and stability that is required. Get an executive up and running and stop pandering to the DUP.” Heaton-Harris was to meet the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, later on Thursday, followed by meetings with other party leaders next week. Speaking to journalists earlier on Thursday, Heaton-Harris reiterated the government’s desire to revive Stormont but did not give details. “I am looking forward to delivering enough pressure so we can get the executive up and running, solve the problems of the protocol and some of the more useful domestic things I can do to help people here in their everyday lives.” The DUP’s boycott of Stormont has been popular with grassroots unionists, who wish to see the Irish Sea border – a result of the post-Brexit protocol – removed or weakened. Critics say the executive’s paralysis has hobbled efforts to alleviate the cost of living crisis and could become politically untenable for the DUP as energy prices rise. However, Truss told the House of Commons a plan to freeze energy bills at an average of £2,500 a year for two years from 1 October would cover Northern Ireland, which has a different energy market and rules. Conor Murphy, Sinn Féin’s finance minister, said the prime minister’s promise lacked detail, leaving doubt over energy bills in Northern Ireland. “This will bring little comfort to individuals who are having to decide between heating and eating. Likewise, businesses trying to plan ahead for the winter months have no certainty as to when support will be forthcoming.” Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP, said resolving the protocol should be the government’s priority. “Until that is dealt with, people will find that their cost of living goes up even more than the rest of the UK, due to additional costs which the protocol is imposing on goods coming into Northern Ireland. The cost of living issues are not going to be dealt with by Stormont – Stormont doesn’t have the money. It is going to come from Westminster.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/26/chasing-hares-review-factory-drama-moulds-its-own-subversive-power-play","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T13:27:41Z","webTitle":"Chasing Hares review – factory drama moulds its own subversive power play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/26/chasing-hares-review-factory-drama-moulds-its-own-subversive-power-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/26/chasing-hares-review-factory-drama-moulds-its-own-subversive-power-play","fields":{"bodyText":"This drama about the gig economy and the workers trapped inside it plays out like a thriller. Sonali Bhattacharyya’s fast, witty script finds an original way to tell the global backstory of the zero-hours workforce, joining up the dots from child labour in West Bengal to unethical working conditions in Britain. Factory worker and aspiring writer Prab (Irfan Shamji) gets his big break when he and his wife Kajol (Zainab Hasan) visit the acting troupe of a traditional Bengali folk theatre or jatra who have just performed in a Kolkata factory back room. To his surprise, Prab is offered a job as a writer and handyman. A former union man, he finds himself doing the dirty work for the bullying factory owner’s son, Dev (Scott Karim). The jatra is “theatre for the people”, Kajol reminds her husband, and so he begins writing quietly subversive Animal Farm-style allegories for the stage. Under the direction of Milli Bhatia, this production carries great currents of dread and intrigue. Prab’s real-life dilemma, and the play-within-the-play, work well together, the former revealing the naked capitalist exploitation of a mafia-like business operation – with shocking details such as that female field workers undergo hysterectomies so their biology does not get in the way of their productivity. There are interesting discussions on the possibility of collective protest and action versus individual survival between Prab and Kajol. The jatra, meanwhile, plays out a miniature version of the feudal tyranny that Dev imposes but also the quest for an egalitarian society. There is an overt sense of the theatrical, with a world of story and illusion conjured through striking silhouette projections of forests and falcons (video design by Akhila Krishnan) as Prab tells bedtime stories to his baby girl, as much to progress his allegories as to entertain her. A journalist who tries to lure Prab into whistleblowing has a rapacious, transactional quality. The culpability of the west is made clearer in a parallel time frame, in present-day UK, where Prab’s daughter (Saroja-Lily Ratnavel) works as a courier for a food-delivery app. Moi Tran’s expressionist stage set is hit and miss; almost empty with puzzling slits around the sides which never reveal their significance, although there is an effective central square that revolves and brings notes of disorientation and alarm. There is strong chemistry between the actors too, especially between the jatra’s star performer, Chellam (Ayesha Dharker), and Prab. Tensions build in the troupe and the always excellent Dharker emanates pure black sarcasm towards Dev, which is both dangerous and amusing. Karim plays the spoilt, swaggering Dev as the classic evil villain but never becomes outright flat or cartoonish. The story has some too-neat parallels between West Bengal and the UK and it is perhaps too sentimental in its ending, but this is easily forgiven when weighed up against its emotional power and intelligence.

The announcement late on Tuesday night provoked immediate accusations that Downing Street had performed “another screeching U-turn” – having previously rejected calls to impose a windfall tax on power giants. On the leadership trail, Liz Truss repeatedly resisted calls to cap huge profits being generated by power companies, after Boris Johnson’s government imposed a £5bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies in May, taking a slice of their profits. The business department said it was stepping in with a temporary “cost-plus revenue limit” for renewable and nuclear electricity generators in England and Wales. This will curb the amount generators can make, “allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue”, and will come into force at the start of next year. The detail was contained in the government’s new energy prices bill, which limits power prices for households at an average of £2,500 a year and is estimated will cost taxpayers about £89bn. It has been estimated that taxing generators such as wind and solar farms could raise between £3bn and £4bn to help offset some of this cost. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, said: “The government has finally accepted the principle of Labour’s call for a windfall tax on excess profits of electricity generators. “After months of telling the country they were utterly opposed to the principle of a windfall tax, they have been dragged kicking and screaming to implement it. “Yet again this shows Labour leading the agenda in British politics with another screeching U-turn from a government in office but not in power. But the government’s delay in acting will have cost billions and the public will pay the price.” Truss ruled out a windfall tax on power generators when vying with Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, calling it “a Labour idea and all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public”. She reinforced her stance when announcing her household bills package last month, saying: “I believe it is the wrong thing to be putting companies off investing in the UK.” But after reversing plans to scrap the top rate of tax last week, Truss’s decision to limit profits at renewable power companies will be seen as another sign of weakness. The government has been accused by institutions including the IMF of making the Bank of England’s cutting-inflation job harder. Mortgage rates soared, along with government borrowing costs, after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget last month. An industry source said: “This is another U-turn as it’s 100% a windfall tax from the people that said they would never do one.” The business department argues that the measure differs from a windfall tax as it will be applied to excess revenues generators are receiving, rather than applying to all profits. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said renewable power generators have been benefiting from “abnormally high prices” because of the link between soaring gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, since Russia’s winvasion of Ukraine. “Low-carbon electricity generators are therefore benefiting from abnormally high prices, while consumers are having to pay significantly more for energy generated from renewables and nuclear, even though they often cost less to produce,” it said. The government said the limit would be a “temporary measure to deal with the exceptional market conditions driven by high global gas prices”. The decision to impose a cap on revenues earned by renewable power companies such as wind and solar farm operators follows months of painful wrangling between the government and industry. Ministers tried to encourage companies to voluntarily move on to contracts for difference (CfDs), that cap profits above a certain level, but without much success. BEIS said the revenue cap would remain in place until the markets returned to normal or generators moved on to other market arrangements, such as CfDs. “It will ensure consumers pay a fair price for low-carbon energy and has the potential to save billions of pounds for British bill payers, while allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue,” BEIS said. Nevertheless, generators reacted with dismay. Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, said: “We’re deeply worried at the suggestion renewables generators are making extraordinary profits when our power has been sold in advance at much lower pre-war prices – a fraction of today’s cost – protecting customers by hundreds of millions of pounds. “It’s disappointing that such a significant market intervention by the government has come with so little detail, all this does is create uncertainty. This crisis has been caused by the cost of gas and it’s strange the proposed solution is to cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave the gas sector untouched.” A spokesperson for SSE said: “Any revenue cap must be set at a level that doesn’t discourage essential investment in the UK’s renewable energy sector and therefore should be comparable to other countries, particularly given the €180 [per megawatt hour] cap being implemented by the EU. After all, the key lesson of the current energy crisis is the need to bolster our homegrown energy defences. “It is also vital that the cap does not negatively impact on security of supply this winter, therefore flexible technologies, such as hydro, that require strong price signals to meet demand when most needed should be excluded.” The announcement was light on details, but the government said it had been working closely with industry on the proposal, and would launch a consultation shortly. BEIS is liaising with the Scottish government to confirm whether the measure will extend to Scotland. The legislation also allows for a temporary revenue limit to apply in Northern Ireland. In determining the limit, BEIS said it was taking into account the pre-crisis expectations for wholesale prices, and what a reasonable upper estimate for those might be. It intends to allow generators to keep a proportion of their revenue above the limit. Britain has a diverse energy generation sector, including companies supplying power from gas- and coal-fired power plants, windfarms and nuclear power stations. Centrica, ScottishPower and some others serve consumers directly, but many are focused on delivering power to retail suppliers. The biggest generators include SSE, E.ON, Ørsted and Drax, which runs a large eponymous power plant in North Yorkshire. Nevertheless, the announcement implied Drax and nuclear power plants and other so-called baseload power providers would be given special treatment under the scheme, given “the importance of continued investment in these supplies”. In May, the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced what he called a “temporary, targeted energy profits levy” of 25% on oil and gas firms, but with a 90% tax relief for companies that invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business and energy secretary, said: “We have been working with low-carbon generators to find a solution that will ensure consumers are not paying significantly more for electricity generated from renewables and nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/17/joined-up-thinking-by-hannah-critchlow-review-the-power-of-collective-cognition","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Joined Up Thinking by Hannah Critchlow review – the power of collective cognition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/17/joined-up-thinking-by-hannah-critchlow-review-the-power-of-collective-cognition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/17/joined-up-thinking-by-hannah-critchlow-review-the-power-of-collective-cognition","fields":{"bodyText":"Intelligence – at least according to IQ test scores – is declining across the globe, which won’t surprise anyone who follows the news but doesn’t exactly bode well for the continuing survival on the species. What to do? One suggestion made by this book is that we all connect our brains to neural interfaces which will collect everyone’s thoughts in a massive “super-brain cloud”, the better to sweetly reason ourselves collectively out of disaster. What could possibly go wrong? This isn’t yet feasible anyway, but it is an example of the neuroscientist author’s determined optimism. Her central argument is important and correct: that we have become too used to thinking of intelligence as the private skill of individuals, vying against one another in a neoliberal world of relentless competition. What is needed, especially in an age of irredentist warmongering and climate disaster, is a greater emphasis on our ability to reason together, our “collective intelligence”. This has been possible, of course, since we gruntingly taught one another how to make flint tools around the cave fire. What does neuroscience add to our understanding of it? Well, the brainwaves of people cooperating on a task can synchronise, which is interesting. And feelings of empathy help groups solve puzzles – as do higher female-to-male sex ratios. As in all good pop-science books, Critchlow describes many such experiments with clarity and infectious surprise. One Chinese psychologist found that creative problem-solving can be helped by going for a walk – but only if you don’t decide your route in advance. (This dampens down the activity of the decision-making prefrontal cortex.) On the other hand, there is also some of this sort of thing: “Scientists recently scanned grandmothers’ brains while they looked at photos of their grandchildren and saw areas of the brain associated with emotional empathy light up.” Um, no shit. The book takes a more original and weirder turn as Critchlow speculates about technological interventions that could spur a greater level of communal thinking. Some seem sensible enough: improve ventilation, because higher CO2 concentrations make us stupider; and cultivate a different use of media, because exposure to bad news makes us stupider too. But a lot of other suggestions seem rather dystopian. Critchlow speculates that we might be evolving culturally to become “a socially integrated mega-group, much like beehives and ant colonies”. This “might feel alien”, she allows, “but it could usher in a utopian era of human cooperation.” It might also feel alien because it’s how the Borg work in Star Trek, and they are not exactly utopian: they forcibly colonise and absorb every other life form they meet. She even implies that people who are not using their reasoning powers in order to further the good of the collective are, in this brave new world, to be chastised or even medically corrected, with neural implants or pharmaceuticals stimulating empathy circuits in the brains of psychopaths or narcissists. But the attempt to enforce collective thinking is a notable characteristic of totalitarian societies (the Borg is not a democracy). Critchlow does allow that collective reasoning is often dismayingly derailed by bias, emotional contagion, groupthink and other regrettable bugs in the human code, but doesn’t quite explain how such effects would be avoided rather than amplified in the glorious brain-cloud future. “The world could be altered by the power of our minds to tackle everything,” Critchlow enthuses at the end, though it remains unclear how groovy sci-fi brain interfaces might improve upon the joined-up thinking already enabled for millennia by the technology of writing, which has allowed humans to reason together across space and time and construct the edifice of modern science itself. Has it in the meantime also given rise to global consensus on questions of ethics and values? Obviously not. Old-fashioned group thinking, on the other hand, has definitely also given us racism, the Bolsheviks and conspiracy theorists who think that Covid vaccines contained nanorobots to control our minds. The difference is that Critchlow thinks inserting nanorobots (or “neural dust”) to control our minds might actually be a good idea.

By commercial standards, it was a roaring success: it ran for 17 weeks, breaking a record previously held by Gielgud himself, and was packed out every night. But, for many of those involved, it was not a happy experience. And that is the subject of a new play by Jack Thorne, The Motive and the Cue, which starts previewing at the National Theatre in April, directed by Sam Mendes with Johnny Flynn as Burton, Mark Gatiss as Gielgud and Tuppence Middleton as Elizabeth Taylor, who had married Burton during the production’s Toronto tryout and whose offstage presence was a source of permanent distraction. There are endless testimonies as to the tensions caused by the production. Melvyn Bragg in Rich, his Burton biography, reveals how the actor felt so unprepared that before the first performance he summoned his mentor and surrogate father, Philip Burton, to Toronto to privately take him through the text. Gielgud later lamented: “The American cast did not understand very much of what I was trying to do. All they wanted was motivation.” Best of all is Letters from an Actor by William Redfield, the production’s Guildenstern, in which, while sympathetic to Burton and Gielgud, he says: “Between the two men there is an artistic disagreement, an aesthetic split. It is a fundamental difference of both belief and technique.” All of which suggests Thorne has plenty to get his teeth into. But how good or bad was the Burton Hamlet? A film was made of the 100th performance and, although it’s not easy to find, I was kindly given a viewing of it by the National’s archival department. The first thing to hit me was that Gielgud had an idea but no concept. The central notion was that the play should be done in rehearsal clothes. That’s fine up to a point except that Alfred Drake’s Claudius, in slacks and cardigan, looks as if he is en route to his golf club. If shows sometimes achieve a momentum when stripped to the bare essentials – and I saw that happen once in Tbilisi when the National’s sets and costumes failed to arrive for Peter Hall’s production of The Winter’s Tale – it is because there was an agreed concept in the first place. Here no one seems to have decided what Hamlet is actually about. There is, however, Richard Burton who is the production’s raison d’etre. You see that when he makes his first upstage entrance and gets a big round of applause: mind you so do all the show’s other recognised names from a clap-happy audience. But, while Burton has a palpable star-presence, I found myself puzzled as to what he was telling us about Hamlet. From the start, there is a fierce anger so that “Seems, madam? Nay it is” becomes the first of several explosions of wrath. When the anger cools, Burton shows far more tenderness to Eileen Herlie’s Gertrude than he does to Linda Marsh’s bland Ophelia hinting at a Freudian mother-fixation but the idea is sketched in rather than fully explored. What really struck me was that Burton has two vocal tricks, which he constantly uses to cover the lack of any strong interpretative idea. The first is to insert a pause of a length at which even Pinter might balk into the middle of a line. Thus we get “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are … dreamt of in your philosophy” so that the fluency of the thought is needlessly interrupted. Burton’s other trick is to highlight a seemingly irrelevant word. During the play-scene, he tells the king “The story is extant and written in very CHOICE Italian” as if it matters a damn whether it is beautifully or execrably penned. For me, Burton is at his best when he drops his attention-grabbing devices. Easily his finest soliloquy is “How all occasions do inform against me”, which he speaks with a quiet reflectiveness and he is very good in the scene with George Rose’s First Gravedigger, where he visibly relishes the puns and the word-play. But I suspect Redfield hit the nail on the head when he said that the production was undone by the aesthetic gulf between its star and its director. Gielgud, whose voice had the supple beauty of a violoncello, took a studiously musical approach to Shakespeare’s text whereas Burton, although vocally well-endowed, was an instinctively naturalistic actor whose quirky and eccentric line-readings were a form of rebellion against the Gielgud tradition. The end result is a bit like seeing John Osborne’s Jimmy Porter inexplicably caught up in a five-act verse-drama. But, while I can imagine it will make a fascinating subject for Thorne, the pairing of Gielgud and Burton was destined to produce a certain amount of creative friction. Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere and in this case the only certain winner was the box office. The Motive and the Cue opens at the Lyttelton theatre, London, on 20 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T15:07:41Z","webTitle":"EU sets out plans for windfall taxes and power savings amid energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the EU executive, has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a cap on their revenues, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Oil and gas companies that have made “massive profits” would also be subject to a windfall tax, which Von der Leyen called a “solidarity contribution”. While she did not mention specific numbers, a leaked document seen by the Guardian shows the commission wants a €200 (£173) per megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by low-carbon technologies. The paper states this “mimics the market outcomes that could be expected were global supply chains functioning normally and not subject to the weaponisation of energy through gas supply disruptions”. The leaked document also reveals that the EU executive wants a mandatory 5% reduction in electricity use in peak hours. This echoes an earlier plan for gas savings, although EU member states decided those efficiency measures should be voluntary, raising questions about whether they will accept a mandatory target. Finally, Von der Leyen proposed a cap on the price of Russian gas, saying it was necessary to cut revenues that “Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine”. The EU has spent nearly €88bn on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a tracker from the NGO Europe Beyond Coal. The plan to cap Russian gas ran into immediate opposition from the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who is due to chair an EU crisis meeting on Friday. “It’s not a constructive proposal,” he told the Czech senate, adding that it looked like further “sanctions against Russia [rather] than an actual solution to the energy crisis in Europe”. Criticising the plan from a different angle, Poland argues the bloc should cap the price of all non-EU gas as it fears that targeting Russia will trigger retaliation that will deprive Ukraine of lucrative pipeline transit fees. Speaking in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin dismissed attempts to cap the prices of oil and gas as “completely stupid” and “sheer nonsense”, while claiming that Russia had enough customers in Asia to ride out the damage. “Will they make political decisions contradicting contracts?” he said. “In that case, we won’t supply anything if it goes against our economic interests. We don’t supply anything: no gas, no oil, no coal, no heating oil, nothing.” Asked about his comments, Von der Leyen said Russia had already partially or completely cut off gas to 13 EU member states. “We don’t give anything any more on these announcements by Russia, because we know they’re blackmailing us. The best thing is to fortify ourselves and go towards other suppliers. And have solidarity.” The Kremlin-controlled state energy company Gazprom announced last Friday it would not be restarting gas flows through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline connecting Russia and Europe. While Gazprom blamed “malfunctions” in a turbine along the pipeline, the Kremlin later said it would not resume full gas supplies until Europe lifted sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before the recent shutdown, gas deliveries from Russia to the EU had fallen to 30% of the 2016-21 average. Even before the war, Europe was already facing spiralling gas prices as Chinese demand for fuel surged in the economic rebound after the pandemic. Problems have been compounded by the record-breaking hot dry summer that has pushed up demand for air-conditioning, while reducing hydropower from rivers and reservoirs. Meanwhile half of France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors have been forced offline because of corrosion problems in key pipes and safety checks, reversing the country’s traditional role as exporter of electricity to its neighbours. Von der Leyen said the EU was seeing the effects of climate change and drought and described renewables as “our energy insurance for the future”. The long-awaited plans will be discussed by EU energy ministers in emergency talks on Friday. Von der Leyen – who has been accused of a slow response to the energy price surge – is due to discuss the plans with the bloc’s ambassadors on Wednesday, before further diplomatic talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T01:10:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 256 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Russian troops have been looting Kherson ahead of a potential withdrawal from the south-eastern Ukrainian city. Items taken range from art and cultural exhibits to ambulances and tractors. There has been an assassination attempt on a judge who sentenced two Britons to death in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Alexander Nikulin, who said Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner should be shot by a firing squad, was shot in Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, on Friday night. The local supreme court justice is in a serious condition in hospital. Russian troops are allegedly searching for residents in the Kherson region who are refusing to evacuate, before the forces’ potential withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has claimed its forces killed another 600 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has said the country did supply Russia with drones but that it took place before President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Kyiv. The drones have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed talk of limited Iranian supplies to Russia, saying Kyiv had downed 11 drones on Friday alone. He said: “If Iran continues to lie about the obvious, it means the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia pays Iran for such cooperation.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Iran “should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine will be much larger than the benefits of Russia’s support”. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he does not believe Russia will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The 300,000 troops Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability” as the Russian military is struggling to train them, UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported. Scheduled power cuts will take place on Sunday in seven Ukrainian provinces including major cities such as Kyiv. Other provinces affected are Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Poltava. About 500 power generators have been sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries to help with the energy problems caused by Russian attacks. At least 112,000 Russians have emigrated to Georgia this year, border crossing statistics show. Reuters reported that the first large wave of 43,000 arrived after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February and the second wave came after Putin announced a nationwide mobilisation drive in late September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/11/aukus-pact-australia-pays-830m-penalty-for-ditching-non-nuclear-french-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-11T06:58:52Z","webTitle":"Aukus pact: Australia pays $830m penalty for ditching non-nuclear French submarines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/11/aukus-pact-australia-pays-830m-penalty-for-ditching-non-nuclear-french-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/11/aukus-pact-australia-pays-830m-penalty-for-ditching-non-nuclear-french-submarines","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian government has agreed to pay €550m (A$830m) in a settlement with Naval Group over the former Morrison government’s controversial decision to scrap the French attack class submarine project. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced on Saturday the confidential settlement would draw a line under the cancelled $90bn project. Labor gave bipartisan support to the Aukus partnership that replaced the project – under which the US and the UK have offered to help Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines and cooperate on other advanced technologies. However, Albanese said on Saturday the way it was handled by the former Morrison government “has caused enormous tension in the relationship between Australia and France”. “This is a fair and an equitable settlement which has been reached. It follows, as well, discussions that I’ve had with President [Emmanuel] Macron and I thank him for those discussions and the cordial way in which we are re-establishing a better relationship between Australia and France,” he said. The French defence minister welcomed the settlement deal on Saturday afternoon. “It permits us to turn a page in our bilateral relations with Australia and look to the future,” Sebastien Lecornu said. Speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit in Singapore, Lecornu said France valued its “friendship” with Australia. “Just because a government in the past did not keep its word, it does not mean we have to forget our strategic relationship,” he said. “Australia has a new team in power, we are happy to be able to work with them.” The agreement was forged by the new Labor government just three weeks after the federal election. Albanese confirmed it was not reached before the election by the former government and kept confidential. The total cost of the failed submarine project for Australian taxpayers is $3.4bn, which is down from the $5.5bn touted as the government’s total approved budget for the project. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, officials had considered this to be a maximum “envelope”. Albanese said despite the lower cost, it was still “an extraordinary waste from a government that was always big on announcement but not good on delivery, and from a government that will be remembered as the most wasteful government in Australia’s history since federation”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prime minister said it would allow Australia to move forward in its relationship with France. Macron accused Morrison of lying to him about the deal, and Morrison later said he was “not going to cop sledging of Australia”. Part of a text message exchange between the two leaders was released to several Australian media outlets in an apparent attempt to blunt the idea France had been completely blindsided by the cancellation. French officials denounced the leaking as “an unprecedented new low”. By contrast, Macron had warmly welcomed Albanese’s election to office last month, extending an invitation for Albanese to visit Paris, which the prime minister said he had accepted. “Details are being worked through. We have a critical relationship. France, of course, plays a critical role in the European Union. And President Macron, of course, has recently been re-elected, I am newly elected and it is important that we have engaged – I appreciated his message of congratulations and the fact that both of us want to reset the relationship between our two countries,” he said. “I see a personal meeting between myself and President Macron in France as being absolutely vital to resetting that relationship, which is an important one for Australia’s national interests.” On Thursday, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he had devised a plan as defence minister before the election to buy two Virginia-class submarines by 2030 to fill the gap before the nuclear submarines are delivered, claiming he had “formed a judgment the Americans would have facilitated exactly that”. Albanese said on Saturday that Dutton had presided over an “all-announcement, no-delivery” regime. “You don’t defend your country and our national security with a media release – you defend it with operational capability,” he said. “My government intends to concentrate on delivering rather than the statements that Peter Dutton has made that contradict all of the statements that he made while he was defence minister.” As to whether Australia was negotiating for the submarines Dutton mentioned, Albanese said he would not be making “on the run comments” about national security and defence. The Aukus announcement also forced the UK and the US into damage control with France. The French defence minister last year cancelled talks with her UK counterpart after the deal was announced, while the US president, Joe Biden, had a 30-minute call with Macron to mend relations after France recalled its ambassador from Washington.

From Frank Dikötter’s How to Be a Dictator to Henry Kissinger’s Leadership, the format seems to be to string together chapters on various world leaders who changed the course of history, for good or bad, and reflect on the patterns between them. The latest offering is Ian Kershaw’s Personality and Power, in which the great historian of Hitler and his movement pens a dozen lucid portraits of the leaders – half of them dictators, the others democrats, to varying degrees – who shaped Europe’s 20th century. His starting point is Karl Marx’s dictum of 1852: “Men make their own history, but not as they please, in conditions of their own choosing, but rather under those directly encountered, given and inherited.” How far is the leader’s power shaped by personality, and how much by circumstance, Kershaw asks. Each chapter follows the same sequence of subsidiary issues from the preconditions of the leader’s rise to a brief discussion of his legacy. Kershaw also draws from Max Weber’s theory of “charismatic” leadership: the charisma of the leader is created by his following of believers, whose ideals are invested in the “chosen one”, or manufactured for him by his movement or the state through a personality cult. Kershaw was a pioneer of this approach. One of his best early works, The Hitler Myth (1987), showed how Hitler’s power rested on his propaganda image and its public perception. He emphasises how extraordinary leaders are created by crises. This goes for the dictators who came to power through social revolution (Lenin), the collapse of parliamentary politics (Mussolini) or economic depression (Hitler), and leaders in democracies whose greatness came as saviours of their nation in a time of war (Churchill and De Gaulle), or for those who steered their country to democracy after ruinous dictatorships (Adenauer, Gorbachev). Crises can be fabricated too, a point Kershaw might have made more of. It was the “war scare” of 1927 (when Pravda published fake news of a British planned invasion of the USSR) that enabled Stalin to defeat his rivals for the leadership and force through his version of the five-year plan; and whipped-up fears of Bolshevism that allowed Mussolini and Franco to rally frightened Catholics behind their cause. Kershaw fills his lively profiles with revealing details of the leaders’ characters, their working style and relations with the ruling structures that supported them. Margaret Thatcher “thrived on abrasive argument and combative dispute”, relying on her “workaholic habits” and ‘“forensic interrogative powers” as a trained lawyer to “carry her case against cabinet colleagues who were less well prepared or more submissive in their character”. Franco wore down the resistance of his ministers by not allowing toilet breaks in meetings that could last all day and night. His bladder control was “extraordinary”, Kershaw informs us. He also highlights the mistakes that leaders made to bring about their fall, analysing how far these can be explained by their own stubborn personalities, ideological blinkers, or by the hubris that affects so many leaders, especially dictators, when they’ve been in power for too long. Such mistakes are apparent only in hindsight. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine will go down in Russia’s history as a mistake if it ends in a defeat, but “victory” will erase the military blunders and atrocities from the national memory. Power decides everything. As you would expect, Kershaw is at his most masterful in his sketches of the three German leaders in this book. He is also very good on Mussolini and De Gaulle. He is less convincing on Lenin and Stalin, where his reliance on secondary sources makes for a flat and conventional account. He doesn’t really understand the sacred base of charismatic power in Russia, the Byzantine tradition of saintly tsars and princes that transmogrified into the cults of Lenin and Stalin; nor the patrimonial nature of autocracy in Russia, where the leader is the master of the land and its people, a form of despotism and enslavement of society that goes from the Mongols to Stalin (“Genghis Khan with a telephone”, as the Bolshevik Bukharin described him). The very word for power in Russian (vlast) comes not from action, as in western languages (puissance, potenza, macht, etc), but from the term for a fiefdom, a territory owned by its ruler. Kershaw devotes the final chapter to a summing up of the factors that defined the exercise of power by all 12 leaders in the book. His purpose, as he tells at the start, is to test seven propositions about personal leadership. They are all fairly obvious. Did we really need to read this book to learn, for example, that “single-minded pursuit of easily definable goals and ideological inflexibility combined with tactical acumen enable a specific individual to stand out and gain a following”? Or that “concentration of power enhances the potential impact of the individual – often with negative, sometimes catastrophic consequences”? Perhaps in the end the cultural specificities of the seven countries explored in this book, their differing traditions of understanding power and authority, do not lend themselves so easily to general principles. Is it even meaningful to compare the modes of leadership in systems as diverse as the Third Reich and Tito’s Yugoslavia or Britain under Churchill and Thatcher? There is much to be admired in Kershaw’s cogent and astute analysis of these leaders in power, but I’m not sure there are any general lessons to be learned. • Orlando Figes is the author of The Story of Russia (Bloomsbury) • Personality and Power: Builders and Destroyers of Modern Europe by Ian Kershaw is published by Penguin (£30).

Antonia comes home from the supermarket with her friend Margherita bearing news of spontaneous mass refusal to pay for groceries (and her own share of the spoils). In Dario Fo and Franca Rame’s 1974 satire on the capitalist system, this leads to “miracle pregnancies” (male as well as female), murder (or maybe not) and police (or maybe communist) infiltration. Cécile Trémolières’s design almost steals the show. Vents rise from the floor and yawn, puffing vapour, over the in-the-round stage. An enormous pipe with a metal door set into its closed-off end forms one entrance; opposite, a metal slide, snaking down from the theatre’s balcony, forms the other. Industrial piping marks out the floorplan of a domestic kitchen (chest freezer; table with gas hob) and bedroom (double bed; statue of the Virgin Mary). This wacky setting is supposed to show the modest flat inhabited by Antonia (Samantha Power) and her husband, Giovanni (Roger Morlidge). She has been made redundant; he soon will be. Times are very hard indeed. The problem with the improbable design – exaggerated by the playful, Looney Tunes-style lighting and sound (Elliot Griggs and Russell Ditchfield respectively) – is that, in the cartoonlike world it evokes, nothing is ever so serious that crushed characters can’t bounce back. This is at odds with Fo and Rame’s scenario, where hilarity is a foil for desolation and builds to a climax of desperation: Margherita (movingly portrayed by Katherine Pearce) failing to imagine a future for the now homeless, jobless friends. Marieke Hardy’s adaptation needs disturbingly few minor additions to make it ring true to our present. Under Bryony Shanahan’s patchy direction, the five actors work hard to strike a comic tone that chimes with the bubblegum-bright set, yet also engages us with the characters and their dilemmas. After a first-half struggle, they finish on a high note (deserved namechecks to multiple-role-playing Anwar Russell, and Gurjeet Singh as Margherita’s husband, Luigi). Even as we laugh, we cannot help but recognise that, however crazy the action, it’s not as mad as our world, where the pursuit of profit means that the workers who create wealth cannot afford light, heat, rent or food.

In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas.” In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there is a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital, saying that the city’s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. US president Joe Biden is to welcome British prime minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind”. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/17/public-ownership-of-power-assets-key-to-smooth-shift-to-renewables-queensland-energy-minister-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T16:30:40Z","webTitle":"Public ownership of power assets key to smooth shift to renewables, Queensland energy minister says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/public-ownership-of-power-assets-key-to-smooth-shift-to-renewables-queensland-energy-minister-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/public-ownership-of-power-assets-key-to-smooth-shift-to-renewables-queensland-energy-minister-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Retaining control of its electricity assets has given Queensland an edge over other regions in coordinating and funding the race to decarbonise the economy, the state’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, says. Queensland last month unveiled a $62bn plan to rid its power grid of coal by 2036, replacing the generation with 25GW of large-scale wind and solar farms, new transmission lines and two giant pumped hydro plants for storage. With its dominant ownership position of electricity generation and distribution assets, the government has been able to offset the impact of higher energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rebates of $175 a household will this year total $385m “that would otherwise have gone to overseas shareholders”, de Brenni said. “We should expect there to be some continued elevation of wholesale electricity prices, that’s likely to flow through to retail bills,” he said, adding Queensland could shield households “in a way that no other state on the east coast can”. De Brenni said public ownership of the energy system allowed the state to ensure new large-scale generation, transmission, and storage infrastructure could be built in time, potentially ahead of when ordinary market signals would allow. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Because Queenslanders chose to keep energy assets in public hands, we have unprecedented control to guide the transformation of our energy system,” he said. “We’re going to deploy those natural advantages that Queensland has to make sure that at all times the lights stay on and power remains affordable.” The introduction in June of three new tiers for mining royalties to bolster state coffers has also helped pay for the energy transition, de Brenni said. New South Wales, which has a similar mix of coal for domestic use and export in its economy, has so far resisted lifting its royalty rates to collect a higher share of the record profits being garnered by miners. Queensland’s resources sector, which complained it wasn’t consulted on the changes, has estimated the impost would collect an extra $15bn this financial year alone. “Queenslanders have a right to be rewarded when their resources are attracting incredibly high profits on global markets,” de Brenni said. “We’ve been able to utilise some of those coal royalties in terms of supporting our transition to renewable energy. So high coal royalties in Queensland equal cleaner energy in Queensland.” Despite criticism from miners, de Brenni said “citizens the world over want to see more investment by governments into the transition”. “Citizens would welcome the deployment of those returns to addressing climate change.” The transformation of the energy sector won’t come cheap and will likely add costs to power bills across Australia in the near term to pay for new capacity and transmission. But the near zero cost of generating renewable energy should bring down power prices, analysts say. Queensland has been the clean energy laggard among Australian states, with just under 20% of electricity generated last year sourced from renewables. Nationally, the average was almost one-third. The head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said Queensland’s ownership of electricity assets would ease coordination issues, although the state’s vested interest might explain why its transition away from fossil fuels lagged most other states to date. “Fossil fuel resources are horribly undertaxed in Australia,” Mountain said. “The Queensland government’s policy to tax a ‘bad’ to fund a ‘good’ is excellent policy that other states should emulate.” But Mountain did query the government’s plan for pumped hydro, which includes spending $270m to advance the Borumba and Pioneer-Burdekin sites to supply as much as 7GW of storage. Pioneer-Burdekin alone would be 5GW, or 2.5 times the size of Snowy Hydro’s 2.0 project, and the largest in the world. “I think there is a reason that pumped hydro gets so little attention internationally,” he said. “To the government’s credit it is funding proper studies and no doubt Queenslanders will be seeking a good reason if [it] does commit huge capital” to the projects, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/24/energy-firm-sse-reports-near-doubling-of-annual-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-24T12:52:47Z","webTitle":"SSE to invest £40bn in green energy as profits almost double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/24/energy-firm-sse-reports-near-doubling-of-annual-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/24/energy-firm-sse-reports-near-doubling-of-annual-profits","fields":{"bodyText":"SSE has set out plans to invest £40bn in clean energy over the next 10 years as it reported a near-doubling of its annual profits compared with the year before thanks in part to its fossil fuel power stations. The Perth-based FTSE 100 company said it would carry out its record-breaking green energy plan by investing “far in excess of its earnings” after making an adjusted pre-tax profit of £2.18bn for the 12 months to the end of March, up from almost £1.16bn the year before. The sharp increase in full-year profits came as earnings from its gas-fired power stations surged almost fourfold to £1.24bn for the last financial year, up from £331.1m the year before. SSE has sought to downplay the soaring fossil fuel profits in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered a jump in global energy market prices that has ignited calls for a windfall tax on the excess profits made by power generators and oil companies. It did not face higher taxes on its profits from gas-fired power stations because the government’s energy generator levy focused on renewable power. But SSE’s renewables business made a fraction of the profit that its gas plants made last year, rising to £580m from £568.1m the year before, meaning it was required to pay only £43m under the levy. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE’s chief executive, justified the low levels of tax by arguing that the UK’s energy crisis “was a gas crisis” and that its investments would help the UK move away from a reliance on gas. SSE made “profits with a purpose” that would accelerate its plans to invest in renewable energy and reinforce the UK’s electricity grid to help speed up the UK’s climate agenda, he said. The company has not ruled out overseas investment as part of its £40bn 10-year plan. Phillips-Davies told journalists that the company would consider investing in the US but he expected Europe to remain SSE’s core market. “Action, not just ambition, is what is needed to provide lasting solutions to the problems of climate change, energy affordability and security – and, with a record-breaking investment programme, that is what we are delivering,” he said. SSE runs gas-fired power stations alongside hydroelectric plants and windfarms and an electricity transmission business. The company set out a five-year plan to accelerate the UK’s net zero ambitions in 2021 by spending £12.5bn. It has increased its spending by 40% to £18bn and extended the plan to 2027. The new plan will include a 50% increase in capital spending for its regulated electricity networks, a 40% increase for its renewable electricity generation and a 10% increase for its low-carbon flexible thermal generation and other businesses. “Through delivery of our societally aligned strategy we are accelerating the build-out of renewables, reinforcing the networks needed to decarbonise, providing much-needed flexible generation, and working hard to ensure no one is left behind in the transition to net zero,” Phillips-Davies said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/09/frances-food-industry-pledges-to-cut-prices-government-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T13:22:44Z","webTitle":"France’s food industry pledges to cut prices after government pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/frances-food-industry-pledges-to-cut-prices-government-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/09/frances-food-industry-pledges-to-cut-prices-government-pressure","fields":{"bodyText":"Big food manufacturers in France have pledged to lower prices on hundreds of products next month after pressure from the government. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said he had reached a deal with 75 manufacturers after signs that the prices being paid by the industry for raw materials had been falling. Le Maire has threatened financial sanctions if the companies break the promise to bring down prices for consumers on products where wholesale costs have fallen, Reuters reported. Prices on the list of products, which will be published next week, would be cut by between 2% and 10%, he said. “As soon as July, prices of certain products will go down,” Le Maire told France’s BFM TV on Friday after meeting representatives of the food industry the previous day. “There will be checks and there we will be sanctions for those who don’t abide by the rules,” he added, mentioning pasta, poultry and oil as some of the products on which prices will be cut. High food price inflation has been seen across Europe after energy prices, wages and commodity costs soared after the Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Concerns about “greedflation” by manufacturers and supermarkets – keeping prices artificially high despite a falls in costs such as shipping, fuel and some food commodities such as wheat – have prompted a competition watchdog investigation in the UK and action elsewhere. Last month, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, met UK food manufacturers to urge them to curb price rises amid grocery inflation of 17%, according to the latest government data, but no formal price controls have been introduced. Rishi Sunak also called a recent summit of farmers, food producers and some of Britain’s largest supermarkets in the first meeting of its kind to discuss food security in the UK but attenders said inflation was not on the agenda. In Hungary, the country’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, imposed mandatory price cuts on some basic food items, while France previously agreed an “anti-inflation quarter” with the large supermarkets chains to keep a cap on the price of essentials. The deal expires next week but the French government has said it plans to extend the measure throughout the summer. While annual inflation in France eased more than expected in May to 6%, its lowest level in a year, food prices were still up 14% last month after a record increase of almost 16% in March. Profits have soared in the country’s food industry in the first quarter of 2023, up 15% on the previous three months, according to data from the Insee statistics agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T13:03:16Z","webTitle":"UK ministers float plan for ‘hydrogen-ready’ domestic boilers from 2026","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers are considering requiring that all new domestic boilers be “hydrogen-ready” from 2026, as they announced £100m for nuclear and hydrogen projects. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has launched a consultation on improving boiler standards, and has argued there is a strong case for introducing hydrogen-ready boilers in the UK from 2026. The government is examining options to replace polluting fossil fuel gas in Britain’s energy system and has offered grants for households to install heat pumps. A ban on gas boilers in new homes comes into force in 2025, although uncertainty remains over the timeframe for the phase-out of fossil gas in existing homes. Hydrogen-ready boilers are initially installed to burn fossil gas but then can be easily converted to operate on hydrogen by an engineer. The consultation document argues that the strategy will reduce “the costs associated with scrapping natural gas-only boilers before the end of their useful life”. “Mandating hydrogen-ready boilers will give industry the confidence to prepare supply chains to ensure the benefits of the potential transition are maximised,” officials said. However, they cautioned that there is no guarantee that boilers will ultimately be converted to run on hydrogen. While hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in the decarbonisation of heavy industry and the transport network, opinion is split on the practicality of using it in Britain’s gas network and the resulting cost to households. Plans for a pilot to examine the effectiveness of using hydrogen have met local opposition in Whitby, outside Ellesmere Port, where residents have expressed concerns over becoming “lab rats”. The consultation, which closes in late March, will also examine the cost of hydrogen-ready boilers. “The government needs confidence that consumers will not face a premium for their purchase,” it said. Separately on Tuesday, the government announced £77m of funding to aid nuclear fuel production and develop nuclear reactors, and £25m for technologies that can produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste, while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Late last month, the government committed £700m to the Sizewell C nuclear power station project in Suffolk. A search for further investors into the development, which is led by France’s EDF, is ongoing. The funding includes up to £60m for the next phase of research into high temperature gas reactors, with a target of using them by the early 2030s. The energy and climate minister, Graham Stuart, said: “This funding package will strengthen our energy security, by ensuring we have a safe and secure supply of domestic nuclear fuel services, while also creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/mar/09/labour-promises-overhaul-broken-bus-services-england","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T11:53:13Z","webTitle":"Labour vows biggest bus overhaul in 40 years with new powers over operators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/09/labour-promises-overhaul-broken-bus-services-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/mar/09/labour-promises-overhaul-broken-bus-services-england","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour will seek to overhaul failing bus services in the biggest change in the sector in 40 years, giving local areas in England devolved powers to reinstate cancelled routes and set affordable fares. The changes are expected to come within months of a Labour government taking power, as part of a “take back control bill” that would give authorities powers to start their own publicly owned bus services. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the reforms would be the most consequential in a generation for public transport relied on by millions, saying Labour would change a system that was “fundamentally broken”. “It is a total quiet crisis that’s happening in every community,” she said as she met frustrated passengers in Newcastle. “And it has really serious effects on people’s lives, but it also has really serious effects on the economy, and it’s just not getting the attention it deserves.” The changes would be a key plank of the party’s local election strategy for the May polls, which will focus on the cost of living and the decline of public services in an effort to win back control of some councils in the north of England. Haigh said that although the national conversation often focused on trains, which Labour has promised to nationalise, poor performance of bus services often blighted more lives. Twice as many people use buses as those who catch trains, with 2.91bn bus passenger journeys in 2022. Many do not have other options – 80% of people nationally who rely on buses have no other choice. Local people and councillors speaking to Haigh in Kingston Park, despite living just a few miles from Newcastle city centre, told of job changes because of intolerable commutes, social isolation, missed medical appointments because of vanishing buses, and children left to wait at bus stops in the dark. One previously reliable service had undergone three changes in recent years, and other alterations included a service that now included a long walk up a steep hill to the nearest stop, making it impossible to reach for many older people. A commuter route, the only public transport from a new estate, had been changed to take at least 25 minutes longer to reach the city centre. One person said a journey of five miles now routinely took more than an hour and a half because buses did not appear. “The message is, get a car,” he said. Different bus companies on routes in Newcastle use different apps, without joined-up timetables and will not accept each others’ day passes. The local MP Catherine McKinnell said the unreliability of services was terrible for local schoolchildren, who were not profitable commuters so were often left on routes with long delays, waiting in the dark. Haigh said she often encountered disbelief from angry passengers that there was almost nothing politicians or councils could do to maintain or improve services from private bus companies, short of public admonishment. “We’re the only country in the developed world which hands operators power over routes, fares and services with no say for communities,” she said. Labour would offer all local areas the chance to franchise bus services, in a similar way to Transport for London, which would give them the power to set routes and fares and remove poor providers, Haigh said. “This is a radical reform of the way transport is going to work in this country, because it hands power and control back to those communities in a direct attempt to put to reverse that feeling of decline,” she added. “This is the total failure of privatisation. The big idea behind deregulation was that it would lead to huge competition and innovation. And it’s had the opposite effect. We’ve seen bus passenger numbers steadily decline since deregulation.” Greater Manchester, under its mayor, Andy Burnham, is the only other authority in England to have recently been given powers over bus franchising – but the introduction has been fraught with legal challenges and bureaucratic hurdles. Labour’s plans are expected to increase costs, including on central government, but Haigh says it would be “a much more efficient and less wasteful” system. She said many local authorities wanted powers to run their own operations, similar to legacy public bus companies in cities such as Nottingham and Edinburgh. Labour would lift a ban on municipal bus ownership. “It means that profit isn’t being sucked out of the system to private operators. It’s being reinvested into less profitable routes. So if that’s what’s right for local communities, then of course we want to see it,” Haigh said. Haigh, a former Unite shop steward who comes from a family of trade union officials, is one of the shadow cabinet’s last remaining champions of public ownership – and argued the case forcefully for the full nationalisation of rail that was announced at party conference. For the time being, there is likely to be no further movement on nationalisation of other key industries, including mail, water or energy, which the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, underlined in a speech earlier this week. Haigh suggests she would go further than the party is currently committed to “if money were no object” but says she agrees there had to be priorities. “You could make that argument out of any of our essential utilities,” she said. “But I think the private train companies have really done my job for me in this regard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/31/i-dont-care-i-know-i-look-good-dan-daw-on-kink-disability-and-powerful-crip-joy","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-30T15:00:19Z","webTitle":"‘I don’t care, I know I look good’: Dan Daw on kink, disability and ‘powerful crip joy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/31/i-dont-care-i-know-i-look-good-dan-daw-on-kink-disability-and-powerful-crip-joy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/31/i-dont-care-i-know-i-look-good-dan-daw-on-kink-disability-and-powerful-crip-joy","fields":{"bodyText":"Dancer Dan Daw is revelling in his “powerful crip joy” on stage. “I see you looking at me, and I’m going to take ownership of that,” he says. “You can look. I don’t care; I know I look good.” One of the South Australia-born performer’s recent works, Beast, was about people looking at him as though he were an animal. Now, nearing 40, he is taking control of the gaze upon his body in part by displaying his sexual kinks and expressing a desire to be dominated. His latest work, The Dan Daw Show, which is coming to Melbourne’s Rising festival after scheduled performances in Europe, deals in consensual power play: on stage, Daw is the subordinate to non-disabled dancer and longtime friend Christopher Owen’s acts of domination. At one point in the show, Owen treats Daw’s body as a footstool. At another, Daw is encased in a latex box from which the air is vacuumed out. Far from being acts of exploitation, Daw uses kink and the interdependence of a sub-dom relationship to explore his autonomy, transforming his desires as a means to power and freedom. “This is how I want you to take care of my body in a way society just doesn’t,” says Daw, outlining the show’s message. He speaks with Guardian Australia via video conference from his UK home in Manchester, sporting a ginger goatee, black button earrings and shiny stretch tracksuit. The show’s broader ambition is to open up verbal expression, to create a vocabulary for the “excavation of self”. This, in turn, might enable people with disabilities to express their wider needs and desires in the world outside sex and be heard by non-disabled people. An hour before every performance, a “pre-show access drop in” allows audience members to see the set and lighting and where they will be seated, as well as a list of potential triggers and photographs of what will take place. “The audience enter feeling safe,” says Daw, “because we acknowledge kink is scary for a lot of people. We wanted to make sure the audience felt held, and we weren’t out to scare them, because it’s a piece about joy.” The show is a way to create Daw’s own ideal sub-dom experience. “Ultimately it shows that kink is not this harsh, violent thing. I mean, there are moments of intensity, but it’s never violent. It shows an audience who maybe isn’t of the kink world that it’s actually a really beautiful thing.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning One reviewer admitted approaching the show in London with trepidation after receiving a trigger warning via email about its content, yet concluded “the overriding emotion I had witnessed was tenderness”. “The responses from audiences have been quite similar,” agrees Daw. “Audiences versed in the sub-dom world come up and say, ‘Thank you, that’s a really accurate representation of my experience of sub-dom power play.’ “Disabled people come up to me and say, ‘Thank you, I really need to be in my power more. It’s so beautiful to see all this powerful crip joy on stage.’ “The surprising thing is women often come up to me and they say, ‘Thank you, this a reminder I need to take up more space and stop apologising for being a woman.’” ‘I don’t want a work about how I inspire others’ Daw’s conception of the work followed the late disability activist Stella Young calling out those who reduced people with disabilities to “inspiration porn”. The show’s working title was Porno, reflecting how the gaze of non-disabled people on disabled bodies can have an “almost pornographic nature”, says Daw. The idea of “inspiration” intrigued him. He had seen it applied to himself. “If I took the stairs, I’m an inspiration, but if I took the lift, I’m not an inspiration,” he says. “If my disabled body gets what it needs and does it another way, I’m just a burden on society. “But I thought, ‘Hang on, I don’t want it to be a work about how I inspired others, because I’ve been doing that my whole life. It needs to be a work about how I inspire myself.’” Growing up in a working-class family in Whyalla, four hours’ drive north-west of Adelaide, Daw was first inspired to express his needs by his mother, Katrina, and grandmother Heather. Both women had refused to leave the headteacher’s office until Daw was placed in a mainstream class rather than a special education unit. “They advocated for me quite strongly, so I’ve got a lot of that fierceness, and not taking ‘no’ for an answer,” he says. Daw went on to perform with the Adelaide-based companies Australian Dance Theatre and Restless Dance Theatre, as well as Force Majeure. In 2010, he moved to the UK citing the lack of opportunities for disability-led performance at home at the time. Today in Australia, however, he sees “quite a different landscape”, with more opportunities for dancers with disabilities at a professional level. In his latest show, dialogue between Daw and Owen “interrogates” how each of them get to know other people generally. Daw wants to share with the audience how he builds a relationship with someone. In the sub-dom experience at the centre of the Dan Daw Show, those relationships are built via love, care and consent. “And also access,” he says. “You’re always having conversations about: ‘OK, I want to do this to your body because that would give me pleasure. How do you feel about that?’ “But we don’t have those kinds of conversations together in the world. We have the tools to tell each other what we want and what we need from each other when we’re fucking, but we find it really hard to get what we need in the outside world. “That’s what we really wanted to highlight: wouldn’t it be great if we could talk to each other like we were fucking?” The Dan Daw Show runs at Arts House Melbourne from 15 to 18 June, as part of Rising festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T13:04:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","fields":{"bodyText":"Nuclear power advocates believe the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is open to extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant to help wean the UK off gas imports and prevent a faster-than-expected decline in Britain’s fleet of atomic reactors. Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. The Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can. They are fully aware of what the [Hinkley] B station is capable of. She’s old but she’s in good health.” Hinkley’s owner, EDF Energy, would have to produce a safety case for extending the life of a power station that was hooked up to the grid in 1976 and whose closure was previously postponed by seven years in 2012. EDF would have to prove to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that the ageing graphite cores of the plant’s reactors remain in good enough condition that control rods could be inserted, even in the event of a huge and unprecedented earthquake, to prevent a nuclear accident. One nuclear industry source said there was a “six-week window” left, during which EDF could still make that case in time for the ONR to give a verdict on the safety of the plans and postpone the scheduled end to Hinkley generating electricity on 15 July. Greg Hands, a junior minister in Kwarteng’s business and energy department (BEIS), visited Hinkley last week. Engineers there are understood to have told Hands that they expected the plant to shut as scheduled. But the nuclear industry source said that while engineers were naturally focused on shutdown plans they had been working towards for many months, senior figures at EDF were likely to be more open to extending Hinkley’s life. The ONR would ultimately decide on whether such a plan could go ahead but Kwarteng’s approval is crucial. This is because EDF would incur significant costs to put together a safety case for an extension and would need to be confident that ministers would not block it. EDF declined to comment on whether it was planning to do so. BEIS said it had not held any discussions about such a proposal. “It [extending Hinkley] would stop you having to import a chunk of gas,” said the nuclear industry source. The Guardian also understands that Torness, near Dunbar, and Heysham 2 in Lancashire could come off grid earlier than expected, depending on regular assessments of the state of their graphite cores. Their retirement has already been brought forward, with EDF saying earlier this year that they would stop generating in 2028, rather than 2030. In theory, each station that operates for a year can replace more than 1bn cubic metres of gas imports. While nuclear power is traditionally expensive, the sky-high price of gas in recent months, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means the £45 per megawatt hour that EDF gets from its nuclear contract is significantly below wholesale market power prices. The trade unions Prospect and the GMB have also called for the life of Britain’s nuclear fleet to be extended. Pressure on Kwarteng to signal to EDF that the government would back plans to keep Hinkley Point B open comes against the backdrop of concern that the capacity of Britain’s nuclear fleet could be declining even faster than thought. Based on current projections for the retirement of reactors and the building of new ones, UK nuclear capacity will fall from 5.8GW today to 4.4GW in 2028, factoring in the construction of Hinkley Point C but also the end of life of Torness and Heysham. However, the 2028 completion date for Hinkley Point C, which is already over budget and behind schedule is under review, with a forecast due this summer. • This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to refer correctly to the graphite cores and control rods of reactors, rather than to graphite rods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/02/labour-power-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Not radical enough?

As minor skirmishes break out within the party, Labour people should keep their eyes firmly fixed on that prize. All the disasters must belong to the Tories. By the end of this year, Keir Starmer may be in No 10, with the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, next door, and with a cabinet table filled with serious new ministers hitting the ground running, after Liz Truss (let’s assume it’s her) has “hit the ground”, as she mis-tweeted recently. The Tory cabinet will fade as if a bad dream: surely Nadine Dorries, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Suella Braverman, Grant Shapps and the rest never happened? But right now, expect Prime Minister Truss to get a poll bounce, which is why she may grab her only election chance sooner rather than later. Even if she waits for 2023’s boundary changes to come into effect, those extra five to 10 seats won’t be able to outweigh the electoral damage of an escalating cost of living calamity. Nothing but trouble awaits her, shackled to those impossible pledges. Her low-tax bidding war leaves no money. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has exploded the fantasy that tax cuts bring growth. If so, the IFS says, why have countries with higher tax than ours, such as France and Germany, achieved higher growth? The Conservatives’ plans only allow for unacceptable 2-3% increases in public-sector pay. Meanwhile, services are already collapsing, with backlogs of 6.6 million people waiting for NHS England operations, 60,000 court cases pending in England and Wales, and 90% of English schools waiting for urgent repairs. So where will her “smaller state” cuts come from? The damage from Brexit will harden if Truss breaks the Northern Ireland protocol, triggering an EU trade war. If she veers an inch from a rock-hard Brexit then the European Research Group will make her life hell. Her vociferous climate refusers will keep her to abolishing green levies and “not letting net zero affect business”, while long-neglected infrastructure is exposed in energy and water shortages. Boris Johnson sitting behind her, yearning to return, will relish every failure. Whenever the general election comes, Labour looks likely to win: governments fall when voters suffer unmanageable drops in income. A wave of social democratic wins in Australia, Germany, US, Portugal, Norway, Finland, Denmark and others augurs well. Recent polling from Savanta ComRes, Survation, Ipsos and more put the Labour lead in double digits. Starmer beats either contender as best prime minister when “red wall” voters are asked, according to fresh polling from Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies. When the new Tory leader gets a poll bounce, expect impatient Labour people to panic at Starmer’s caution. He only says what he’s against, they complain. Yes, to stop the Tories gleefully turning the election into another Brexit rout, it was essential (though painful) to take a stand against rejoining the single market or customs union: the word “rejoin” ignites old fires. But there’s no doubt the party would make EU peace and trade deals, join the Horizon and Erasmus programmes, and agree equal food and goods standards, easy visas for artists, agree EU professional qualifications and more. I back rejoin movements – but I don’t think Labour should. It’s the same with strikes. All of Labour backs the fight to prevent massive cuts for those whose pay fell or stagnated for a decade. Strikers stand for everyone, the un-unionised are pulled up by union rates. But Starmer is not wrong to think that a convincing government-in-waiting shouldn’t be seen as protesters: parliament is their forum. Labour shadow ministers gnashed their teeth over the picket line grandstanding of Sam Tarry, who reacted to the prospect of being deselected in Ilford South by claiming, “I am on the side of ordinary British workers”, as if the rest weren’t. Mick Lynch is a great advocate, but the shadow cabinet has a more complex task than he does. The party’s position, as a senior Labour official tells me, is “100% behind the right to strike” and “to make sure workers get the pay they deserve”. The commitment to ending “the scourge of low pay” means Labour would introduce fair pay agreements across every sector: no zero-hour contracts, no fire-and-rehire, flexible working and the right for unions to recruit in every workplace. The £28bn Green New Deal will create good jobs setting up electric car battery factories and insulating 19m homes. Last week’s howl at Starmer and Reeves’ betrayal was over renationalising utilities. But is it wise for Labour to spend billions buying these back, before spending on them or anything else? As Reeves’s team pointed out, rail is effectively state-owned already. Pragmatism means super-tough regulation can do more without wasting a penny. Southern Water is imposing hose pipe bans while reportedly leaking 21m gallons a day. Who wants to pay its owner, the investment bank Macquarie, who loaded it with another £1bn debt while its CEO earns £14.8m? England’s water regulator, Ofwat, warns that rising interest rates will see some water companies go bust – that needs state takeovers. As for Labour’s taxes, Reeves says she will target the £174bn lost in tax relief loopholes, so “the broadest shoulders” pay most. She would take another £5bn windfall from energy profits. Making private equity managers pay income tax on earnings that they pretend are “carried interest” could raise £440m annually from 2,000 people, according to the BBC: taxing earned and unearned income the same yields a lot. Charging VAT on private school fees would bring £1.7bn for state schools, where, as promised in last year’s conference speech, Starmer guarantees every child the experience of arts, sports and expeditions. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, promises universal breakfast and after-school clubs and mental health hubs. Sure Start, I’m told, will be back. There’s a great deal more to come. Labour people want more radicalism now. For us, nothing can be enough. But Starmer’s Labour is far less cautious than in 1997 when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown welded themselves to a crippling two-year fall in spending. The quintessence of life on the left is Labour losing over and over again. But all the auguries say not this time. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/10/afternoon-update-aukus-submarine-deal-prompts-china-arms-race-warning-nrl-racism-outrage-and-judge-evicts-breastfeeding-mother","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T05:44:38Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Aukus submarine deal prompts China arms race warning; NRL racism outrage; and judge ejects breastfeeding mother","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/afternoon-update-aukus-submarine-deal-prompts-china-arms-race-warning-nrl-racism-outrage-and-judge-evicts-breastfeeding-mother","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/afternoon-update-aukus-submarine-deal-prompts-china-arms-race-warning-nrl-racism-outrage-and-judge-evicts-breastfeeding-mother","fields":{"bodyText":"Happy Friday! Australia has found itself at the centre of great power geopolitics in Asia, with a promise to deepen military ties with India while drawing the ire of China over a nuclear submarine deal. Anthony Albanese, who has been visiting India this week, called Delhi “a top tier security partner” and announced the Indian military’s participation in the Australian defence force’s flagship war games in August. There was little fanfare in Beijing, however, at Australia’s reported decision to buy nuclear submarines from the US and UK. While Australia argues the new military assets will help it safeguard Indo-Pacific peace and stability, the view from China is that it will do the opposite. “This trilateral cooperation constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation system, exacerbates [the] arms race and hurts peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said. Albanese is expected to formally announce the submarine deal on Monday, US time, when he meets the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego. Top news Judge ejects breastfeeding mother | A judge has been condemned for ejecting a woman feeding her baby while observing a trial in Melbourne’s county court yesterday, saying she was not permitted to breastfeed in court because it was a distraction. Victoria’s attorney general said “no woman deserves to be shamed and humiliated for public breastfeeding”, but the judge defended his actions as “self-explanatory”. North-west Queensland floods | Record-breaking floods have caused a partial evacuation in the outback town of Burketown near the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Full Story ‘Stop the boats’: Is the UK adopting Australia’s cruel mistakes? – with Lenore Taylor This week the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised to “stop the boats” – language familiar to Australians. Our editors discuss in this 19-minute episode the enduring inhumanity of Australia’s immigration regime and whether the UK will learn from our mistakes – or repeat them. What they said … *** “In 2023, it’s extraordinary that this (breastfeeding court ejection) has happened at all. It’s really disappointing.” – Ingrid Stitt Stitt, Victoria’s minister for early childhood, was among many to share their dismay at the Melbourne judge for evicting a breastfeeding mother. In numbers While the Australian government remains committed to tax cuts that would most benefit the wealthiest among us, the US is heading in the opposite direction. The White House’s budget includes proposals to raise revenue from the top end – including a bump to the corporate tax rate. The only challenge: getting it through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

People worry, but there’s a big variation between individuals – it’s just not something that they want to talk about. What’s really important is knowing what’s normal for you: everybody should monitor their bowel function as part of looking after your digestive health. The first thing to be aware of is frequency. It’s normal for individuals to open their bowels anywhere from three times a week, to up to three times per day. What’s really important is that people know what’s normal for them, so that if anything changes, they can talk to their doctor. The colour and consistency of the stool is also important. It may vary slightly day-to-day, depending on what people eat, but the colour should be a chestnut or mid-brown, and the consistency should be smooth like a snake or a sausage. It should be easy to pass as well. Guts UK!’s online Poo-Torial tool helps you to make sense of your bowel movements. If they are yellow or greenish, or greasy and difficult to flush, that can mean that people are possibly not absorbing nutrients. If diarrhoea and constipation symptoms persist for longer than three weeks, or if people find blood in their stool – they should go to their GP. Julie Thompson, information manager, Guts UK! charity There is no shortcut to finding out which foods you’re sensitive to There’s a lot of confusion around the difference between food intolerance and food allergy. Often a patient will ask for a test that will tell them what foods they are sensitive to, but there isn’t one. We can test for coeliac disease, which is when people have an immune-mediated allergy to gluten and have to go on a gluten-free diet. About one in 100 of the population are true-blue coeliacs, and it’s really important that they are diagnosed. But many more people just feel a bit gassy and uncomfortable after eating bread products, or something else in their diet that is setting them off. The question is, how do you tease that apart? One way is to follow an “exclusion diet”, where you eat very bland, comfort-type food for a few days. What that is depends on what you’ve grown up with or you’re used to: one person’s chicken soup might be another person’s pasta or dal or rice or chapati. After a few days, you gradually start to reintroduce your favourite food, one or two a day: coffee, red wine, a curry. Many people find that this gives them a much better understanding of what they are sensitive to. But if you don’t have any trouble and you feel fine, there’s no need. Life’s too short! Prof Stuart Bloom, gastroenterologist, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust That pain may just be wind While I do a lot of bowel cancer screening colonoscopy, often patients will present with abdominal pain in the absence of any other symptoms and immediately think that it might be bowel cancer. Most of the time, it isn’t. Cancer doesn’t usually present with pain. (Think of breast cancer: somebody might incidentally come across a painless lump.) More often, discomfort without other symptoms may be due to trapped wind. This often comes down to diet. High-fibre fruit and vegetables are great for reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and obesity, which make cardiologists very happy, but this healthy diet produces a lot of gas. This is due to the starches or sugars in those vegetables – fructose in particular (and lactose in dairy produce) – and are examples of what are collectively known as “FODMAPs” [fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols]. I wouldn’t want patients to abandon the healthy diet but if they are having trouble, following a low-FODMAP diet will help with the pain of trapped wind. Laurence Maiden, consultant physician and gastroenterologist, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, Kent Gut health isn’t all-or-nothing, but make whatever changes you can maintain A healthy gut microbiome is different for everyone – it’s like a fingerprint in the way that it stays more or less the same. Much of it is genetically determined: some of us have excellent microbiomes, and some are not so good, like those we believe may predispose us to have certain cancers. We can’t say with too much certainty what’s good or bad, or what’s the “ultimate” biome that we should be striving towards. What we do want to see in patients is many different populations of bacteria, not just several dominant ones. You might think of your gut like a rock pool: it might look different at different times of the day, or as the seasons change, but the constituents of it change very little. It’s the same with your microbiome in your gut: it’s quite hard to work to improve it, and to maintain that improvement – but, on the flipside, you’ve got to work quite hard to cause significant damage. If you have a few big nights, your microbiome is going to recover, if you give it the opportunity. That’s why there’s the advice to take three to four consecutive days off drinking, not just to moderate our intake each day: our liver takes a bashing from alcohol and really needs a break. But any changes have got to be sustainable. The gut likes structure. If you live the most virtuous lifestyle for your microbiome for a week, then go back to what you were doing before, you’re not going to have any benefit from those seven days. Make fewer lifestyle changes and habits, but ones that you can continue. Dr Sean Preston, consultant gastroenterologist, Barts Health NHS Trust and London Digestive Health Eat five different colours every day There’s a lot of misinformation out there about how to care for your gut. I often hear patients say “I’ve tried this”, “I’ve tried that” and “What about probiotics?” But there are simple messages that would make a big difference. The first is to eat five different coloured fruits and vegetables every day. For someone who is otherwise healthy, who hasn’t got problems with bloating and diarrhoea and the rest of it, a multicoloured, wholegrain diet feeds the good bacteria naturally. Once that has become routine, you can refine. You can only buy wholemeal bread, and forget about white bread unless as a treat – then you can introduce nuts and seeds for snacking. It doesn’t matter which, so long as they are not salted peanuts. Fermented foods are further down my list. The evidence is patchy: it does look as though it encourages bacteria, and it probably won’t do any harm, but it’s not a long-term solution. If the rest of your diet isn’t supportive, that good bacteria will just starve to death as soon as you stop eating sauerkraut. Prebiotic foods, such as oats and bananas, will help you to grow your own healthy bacteria in the colon naturally. Onions are good, too, but can cause bloating. Probiotic supplements contain the actual bacteria themselves – of course, they won’t survive if you don’t feed them with a healthy diet, and some don’t contain enough live bacteria to work. For most people, they are unnecessary. When you put compost in your garden, the plants will grow; you don’t need fertiliser, and it’s the same in the gut. The trouble is, taking a tablet is much more attractive than eating a banana – but more fruit and veg is a cheap and relatively easy lifestyle change. You could think of it like a sourdough starter: those good bacteria will grow if you feed them properly. Dr Helen Fidler, consultant gastroenterologist, London Bridge Hospital You can boost your good bacteria with exercise Of course exercise is important for your general health, but there are so many advantages specifically for the gut. It improves the motility of muscles and the bowels, ensuring regular bowel movements. It also improves the bacterial balance in the gut – we don’t really understand why yet, but we think it’s to do with ensuring adequate blood supply. There is certainly good scientific evidence that exercise increases good bacteria, independent of what you eat. Exercise also improves the gut integrity through increasing antioxidant defence and reducing inflammation which, in turn, enhances the immune barrier function of the gut. That’s not saying to give up on the healthy diet, but it shows that exercise is still important. We know very well that it reduces stress hormones and enzymes in the body, and boosts the hormones that improve mood, which is good for the gut. Finally, it also reduces the risk of many gut and digestive diseases such as liver disease and bowel cancer. Non-strenuous exercises such as swimming, cycling, yoga and walking tend to be very good if you’re just starting out. Then, if you want to gain more benefit for your heart and lungs, you can go for higher intensity training such as running or weightlifting. However, doing strenuous exercise can also cause symptoms of acid reflux and upset the digestive system in some people, so you need to find a balance. There has been a huge increase in people presenting with digestive problems, especially through lockdown, and a lot of it may well be related to reduced activity levels. Exercise alone can sometimes solve these problems. Dr Sarmed S Sami, honorary consultant gastroenterologist, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; founder and director, Digestive Health UK IBD and IBS may sound alike, but they are very different The two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease: these are lifelong and sometimes major inflammatory conditions affecting the gut. The important thing to note is that they are common, affecting about one in 100 people – and increasing as well. It’s really important to get a timely diagnosis, but often there can be a delay, because the symptoms can be vague. Particularly in the case of Crohn’s disease, the symptoms can overlap with those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like bellyache, fatigue, unintentional weight loss – the unintentional bit is important – and sometimes diarrhoea or an abscess around the bum. For ulcerative colitis, the symptoms can be more overt because there can be blood in the poo, or having to dash to the loo, both of which normally alert people that something is wrong. But the symptoms can be different in different people, and they can come and go. People will think: “Oh, it’s stopped, I’ll leave it”. Likewise they might know someone with Crohn’s and think “I haven’t got that” – but it might be presenting differently for them. If any of those symptoms are present, even if they are coming and going, that is the moment to seek attention, the sooner the better. Prof Ailsa Hart, consultant gastroenterologist and director of inflammatory bowel disease research, St Mark’s Hospital, London Look after your mood, look after your gut A full one-third of the world has some sort of disorder of gut-brain interaction. That might sound surprising but that includes things like IBS, as well as many patients with persistent heartburn, constipation or pain. The gut and the brain are so closely linked, you do need to take both into account. It may sound obvious, but tackling stress is really important. Stress is really toxic to your gut: it increases the permeability of it, letting bacteria into your blood, and the more stressed you are, the worse the effect. Over time, the stressed gut becomes more sensitive to pain and vulnerable to changes in motility. My other bit of advice is, if you think you’ve got clinical depression or anxiety, seek help. We’ve done some work on this: if you have clinical depression, you’re twice as likely to develop IBS, Crohn’s disease and colitis – but there’s also good evidence that if you’re on antidepressants, that reduces your risk. Talking therapies can also seem to restore the gut-brain axis, and may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Beyond that, it’s important to take breaks during the day and get enough sleep at night. If you have ongoing insomnia, that’s putting further stress on your gut. A consistent early wakeup time helps, too, to get it moving. Plus it’s important to regularly schedule activities that pick your mood up. Dr Calum Moulton, consultant psychiatrist, St Mark’s Hospital, London • This article was amended on 22 March 2023.

Here’s where we stand: President Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Eight people were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said five people were also wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire in the town in the Donetsk region. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. She added: But we stand by Ukraine, and we will make Russia pay for its cruelty. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram. The statement read: A priest from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate in Luhansk region has been sentenced to twelve years in prison for informing the enemy about Ukrainian defense positions. The prosecutors proved in court that the priest from Lysychansk-based church assisted the Russian armed groups during hostilities against the Ukrainian army. The priest “gathered information about the number and deployment of equipment, as well as the Ukrainian armed forces’ weapons in Sievierodonetsk and the neighbouring settlements”, it continued. He then sent the information to Russian representatives via mobile messengers, it said, adding that Ukrainian officials discovered the priest’s phone correspondence. President Vladimir Putin hinted at a “long conflict” in Ukraine at a meeting with members of his human rights council. The Russian leader said further mobilisation at this stage wasn’t necessary as only 150,000 out of 300,000 mobilised troops were in combat. He did however say he will use “all means” available and that the risk of nuclear war is on the rise. Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. But mainly the Russian president defended the “special military operation” – his preferred term for what he openly admitted was a Russian war of conquest that he compared with the territorial ambitions of former Russian tsars. “As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea. Russia has been forced to abandon some of those “annexed” territories, notably fleeing the city of Kherson last month due to a sweeping Ukrainian counterattack. Russia now shells the city of Kherson regularly from the other side of the Dnieper River, in effect attacking its own territory. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby’s comments to reporters today came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. The US has had conversations with Ukraine about the accountability of weapons systems “but in the end these are Ukrainian decisions that they have to make”, he said. He added: When we give them a weapons system, it belongs to them. Where they use it, how they use it, how much ammunition they use to use that system, those are Ukrainian decisions, and we respect that. During a press conference with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and their Australian counterparts in Washington, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US had not “encouraged nor enabled” Ukraine to strike inside Russia. Austin, however, said the US was not stopping Ukraine from developing its own long-range strike capability. Eight people were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said five people were also wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire in the town in the Donetsk region. Writing on Telegram, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian shelling killed at least six people and set buildings ablaze in the town. He wrote: Terrorists attacked the peaceful town of Kurakhove. Terrorists are inhuman. And they will be held to account for it.” BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. The company took a £18.7bn hit by writing off the shareholding from its books, but still owns the stock in the Russian state-controlled firm. In a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, MPs from all parties put pressure on the government to ensure BP completely left the country. An analysis by Global Witness shows that a dividend Rosneft has offered BP is worth an estimated £580m, or the equivalent of a third of the UK’s direct aid to Ukraine this year. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who raised an urgent question on the matter, told the Commons on Wednesday: It is utterly shameful that a large, publicly listed British company profits from the sale of oil that is funding Putin’s war. BP must either voluntarily donate the entirety of its Russian dividends to the reconstruction of Ukraine, or the government must take action to force them to do so. The Guardian revealed last week that Oleg Ustenko, the chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand it cuts ties with Rosneft. Read the full story here: It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” and warned that the threat of nuclear war is “on the rise”. In an address to his human rights council, Russia’s leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Vladimir Putin warned that the threat of nuclear war was “on the rise” while speaking during a televised annual session of his human rights council. Putin insisted Russia had not “gone mad” and that it saw its own nuclear arsenal as a purely defensive deterrent. He said: We haven’t gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are. We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that’s an obvious fact. But we aren’t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor. He went on to claim that Russia “could be the only guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity”, adding: It’s up to the new leaders of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” in what he described as a “struggle for our national interests” against the west. Putin said western rights organisations viewed his country as “a second-class country that has no right to exist at all” during a televised annual session of his human rights council. He said: There can be only one answer from our side – a consistent struggle for our national interests. We will do just that. And let no one count on anything else. He continued: We will do this by various ways and means. First of all, of course, we will focus on peaceful means, but if nothing else remains, we will defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal. The Russian leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point. Out of the 300,000 reservists who were called up to fight in Russia’s partial military mobilisation in September and October, 150,000 were now deployed in Ukraine, Putin said. Of those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder performing defensive functions, he said. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year, prompting complaints from Labour that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. The Ministry of Defence announced a £230m contract with Saab, the prime contractor, to make 500 in 2023 and thousands more between 2024 and 2026, demonstrating how long it can take to replenish stocks depleted by gifts to Ukraine. Britain was one of the earliest weapons donors to Ukraine, announcing it would send over the first batch of NLAWs in January, a month before the Russian invasion. It has since donated about 7,000, although exact figures are not available. NLAWs helped Ukraine stop the Russian advance on Kyiv in February and March, with their simplicity of use praised by the Ukrainian military. The shoulder-mounted bazookas have a range of 50 to 800m and can simply be pointed at an oncoming tank. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion. “We are continuing to fulfil our commitment to Nato by ensuring our armed forces will receive a steady supply of these weapons over the coming years,” he said. The NLAWs will be assembled in Belfast by Thales, and the minister highlighted the contribution the contract would make in supporting British jobs. But Labour complained about the length of time taken to sign off the deal. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: “287 days after Putin’s invasion, ministers have finally got their act together.” He said the first new NLAWs “still won’t be delivered until two years after the invasion”, and added: “It’s not clear when the MoD will sign contracts to restock other weapons and ammunition needed for the British army and to support Ukraine.” Britain has committed £2.3bn in military aid in 2023, providing a total of 10,000 anti-tank weapons including Javelin and Brimstone missiles, NLAWs, M270 rocket artillery, 200 armoured vehicles, 28 M109 artillery guns plus almost 100,000 rounds, and 3m bullets, plus more than 25,000 sets of winter clothing. Vladimir Putin has said there is no need for an additional call-up of Russian reservists to fight in Ukraine at the moment, Reuters reported. Putin said that of the more than 300,000 Russian reservists who were drafted in what Moscow called a “partial mobilisation” in September and October, 150,000 were deployed in the zone of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Of those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder were performing defensive functions, he said. The US has been very clear with Ukraine about accountability over weapons systems and its concerns over escalation of the war with Russia, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. “We have been consistent on our concerns over escalation. We have not encouraged them to do that,” Kirby said, after apparent Ukrainian drone strikes on two airbases deep inside Russia. In his office in Kyiv city hall, the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, is planning for the worst and hoping for the best, Peter Beaumont writes. The previous day, in the middle of the sixth mass Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities that had sent Kyiv’s resident to the bomb shelters and metro stations, no rockets had made it through to hit the capital. On the mayor’s desk is a newspaper he has had produced and distributed around the city in recent days. Bearing his name, and the headline “We will overcome and win”, it lists all the emergency services in Kyiv that will be available in case of what should be unthinkable but isn’t: the failure of all power and services to a city of 3 million in the depths of Ukraine’s winter. Across three densely printed pages are details of supermarkets with generators that will work in that emergency, the post offices and banks, and arrangements for public transit. It lists the 45 underground metro stations that will remain open as shelters and provide phone charging and internet, as well as tips for surviving a prolonged blackout. “It’s for the worst-case scenario,” says Klitschko, a former world champion boxer turned politician, picking up the paper. We need to tell people what they need to do if the situation becomes critical and they don’t have internet and connection to media. Life in the city can often seem largely normal, outside of the massive airstrikes that have been taking place, often weekly, since 20 October. Restaurants are busy and the streets are jammed with traffic at close to prewar levels, but with the first snow on the ground and the temperature hitting -8C this week, life in the capital is also overshadowed by the risk of a humanitarian crisis. “Thanks to our military, they knocked out all the missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday,” says Klitschko. But it was only two weeks ago we came close to a total blackout. Then the temperature was above freezing, but imagine the same situation if it happened now when it is close to -10 outside and with no electricity water, or heating. The consequences would be disastrous. Read the full story here: At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. In a statement, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said: There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing. Overall in the war through 4 December, the OHCHR said it had counted 6,702 civilian deaths, and that its monitoring includes violations by all parties. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the “spirit of Ukraine” have been named Time magazine’s 2022 Person of the Year. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, including its embassy in Madrid, which also received a letter bomb. In a statement on his Facebook page, Kuleba wrote: In the last two days, suspicious packages have arrived at embassies in Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Denmark, as well as consulates in Gdansk. In total, we already have 31 cases in 15 countries: Austria (1), Vatican (1), Denmark (1), Spain (5), Italy (4), Kazakhstan (1), Netherlands (1), Poland (6), Portugal (2), Romania (2), USA (1), Hungary (2), France (1), Croatia (1), Czech Republic (2). Ukrainian embassies and consulates had been functioning “in the mode of enhanced security measures” as the “threats to our diplomats keep coming”, he said. According to Kuleba, all envelopes “noted the same address of the sender: Tesla dealership in the German town of Sindelfingen”. He said the packages came from post offices that were not equipped with video surveillance systems. He said the packages came from attackers who took measures not to leave traces of their DNA, adding this “indicates the professional level of embodiment of this action”. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured last Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN last week, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. He said after Wednesday packages started arriving at various Ukrainian diplomatic missions soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. He said: In one case it’s most probably an eye of a cow, and an eye of a pig in another case. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefited from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, where temperatures are below zero. Officials have warned that half of the Kyiv region will be without electricity in the coming days, after a fresh wave of Russian missile attacks on Monday. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. The conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”, the Nato chief said at an event hosted by the Financial Times, after weeks of speculation over the potential for diplomatic talks. He said: The conditions [for talks] are not there now because Russia has shown no sign of engaging in negotiations which are respecting the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is for Ukrainians to decide when the time is right to start to negotiate and to agree the conditions. Most wars and most likely also this war will end at the negotiating table. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter because, he warned, Russia was seeking a “break” in the fighting to prepare for a spring offensive. He said: What we see now is that Russia is attempting to try to freeze this war, at least for a short period of time, so they can regroup, repair and recover, and try to launch a bigger offensive next spring. Ukraine had “momentum”, he continued, adding that he “cannot go into the specific systems that we are now considering”. He said: The paradox is that the more we want a peaceful, negotiated solution, ensuring that Ukraine prevails, the more urgent it is that we provide military support to Ukraine. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. They were cited by Tass as saying: On the Shakhtersk-Torez highway, a truck carrying military personnel collided with a minibus. Sixteen people died, three victims were hospitalised. The truck driver was among the dead, the news agency reported, adding that the cause of the accident had not yet been established. Writing on Telegram, Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), said: A tragedy on the T-0517 highway claimed the lives of 16 people, among them were some of our defenders. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s news so far: The US said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia.” Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state BelTA news agency reported on Wednesday. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. Ukraine’s culture minister has called on western allies to boycott Russian culture, urging a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war. Writing in the Guardian, Oleksandr Tkachenko argues that such a “cultural boycott” would not amount to “cancelling Tchaikovsky”, but would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces. Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss “domestic security”, and Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the moment. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over president Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Ukraine’s culture minister has called on western allies to boycott Russian culture, urging a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war. Writing in the Guardian, Oleksandr Tkachenko argues that such a “cultural boycott” would not amount to “cancelling Tchaikovsky”, but would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. He argues that such a step is right given that the war is “a civilisational battle over culture and history” in which Russia is actively “trying to destroy our culture and memory” by insisting that the two states constitute a single nation. Many cultural figures in Ukraine have said the Russian state is actively instrumentalising its artistic heritage during the conflict. Billboards in Russian-occupied Kherson, for example, showed images of Pushkin, with text referring to the Russian poet’s link with the city. The US said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters. More now on Europe’s energy crisis, via AFP: Sky-high energy prices have caused numerous factories, particularly in Germany’s chemicals sector, which was highly dependent upon cheap Russian gas, to halt operations. But European nations were able to fill their gas reservoirs and no one has been cut off yet. “Until February, the very idea of Europe without Russian energy was seen as impossible,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels. “What was impossible became possible.” A warm autumn that allowed many consumers to put off turning on their heating also helped put Europe in better position for the winter. Overall, the reduction in EU gas consumption by consumers and industry was about 25% in October compared with the 2019-21 average for the month, according to calculations by Bruegel. In Germany, where half of households use gas for heat, data shows consumption down by 20-35% depending on the week. “That’s much more than anyone expected,” said Lion Hirth, a professor of energy policy at the Hertie School in Berlin. “And that’s completely contradictory to the talk that we’ve been hearing from doomsday talkers saying, people just don’t respond. People just keep heating. People don’t change their behaviour. People don’t respond to prices.” Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. The minister later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead, Reuters reported. “After talking to the German defence ministry, I was disappointed to accept the decision to reject Ukraine’s support. Deploying the Patriots to the western Ukraine would increase the security of Poles and Ukrainians,” Blaszczak tweeted on Tuesday evening. “So we proceed to working arrangements for placing the launchers in Poland and connecting them to our command system.” Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, posted on Telegram a short while ago to say that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. Thousands of Russian tourists have found a friendly holiday destination on Venezuela’s Isla de Margarita, a tropical gem with white-sand shores and turquoise waters, AFP reports. Years of political and economic turmoil in Venezuela have frightened off most tourists, with western nations warning citizens not to travel there. So for thousands of Russians seeking sun-soaked holidays, but faced with visa and flight restrictions over the Ukraine war, it is a match made in Caribbean heaven. President Nicolás Maduro, who sees tourism as a secret weapon to revitalise an economy showing timid signs of recovery after years of hyperinflation and a currency in freefall, has signed a deal with Russia, a strong ally, to receive 100,000 tourists by 31 December. In the past two months, 3,000 Russian tourists have taken advantage of a new direct flight between Moscow and Isla de Margarita with Russia’s Norwind Airlines. In news about some of the far-reaching implications of the war in Ukraine, China’s exports and imports shrank at their steepest pace in at least two and a half years in November, Reuters reports, as feeble global and domestic demand, Covid-led production disruptions and a property slump at home piled pressure on the world’s second-biggest economy. Beijing is moving to ease some of its stringent pandemic-era restrictions, but outbound shipments have been losing steam since August as surging inflation, sweeping interest rate increases across many countries and the Ukraine crisis have pushed the global economy to the brink of recession. The downturn was much worse than markets had forecast, and economists are predicting a further period of declining exports, underlining a sharp retreat in world trade as consumers and businesses slash spending in response to central banks’ aggressive moves to tame inflation. Exports contracted 8.7% in November from a year earlier, a sharper fall from a 0.3% loss in October and marked the worst performance since February 2020, official data showed on Wednesday. They were well below analysts’ expectations for a 3.5% decline. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state BelTA news agency reported on Wednesday. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s Security Council as saying. “The movement of citizens (transport) along certain public roads and areas would be restricted and the use of imitation weapons for training purposes is planned.” There was no information on what parts of the country could be affected, Reuters reports. Belarus has said it will not enter the war in neighbouring Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats to Belarus from Kyiv and the West. Ukraine has been warning for months that it fears that Belarus and Russia could be planning a joint incursion across Ukraine’s northern border. Last week, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Viktor Khrenin, to discuss military cooperation. Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher. If certain countries like France and Spain froze prices for consumers, others like Belgium let suppliers more or less pass along the higher costs. If previously natural gas was cheap and plentiful, it is now scarce and expensive. The European wholesale reference price used to fluctuate little, hovering around 20 euros per megawatt hour. This year, it shot as high as €300 before dropping back to around €100. “It’s the most chaotic time I’ve witnessed in all of those years,” Graham Freedman, a European gas analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told AFP. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited troops close to front lines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing servicemen later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces. “Thousands of Ukrainians have given their lives so that the day might come when not a single occupying soldier will remain in our land and when all our people will be free,” Zelenskiy said. The United States said Tuesday it hadn’t “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters. Washington has held back from supplying Ukraine forces with long-range ATACMS missiles that could strike inside Russia out of fears it could lead to a direct confrontation between Russian forces and those of the US and Nato. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. It’s nearly 8am in Kyiv, here’s where things stand: The US said Tuesday it hadn’t “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. Russia said it had been hit hundreds of kilometres from Ukraine by what it said were Soviet-era drones - at Engels air base, home to Russia’s strategic bomber fleet, and in Ryazan, a few hours’ drive from Moscow, on Monday. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for the strikes but nonetheless celebrated them. The strikes killed three people and damaged long range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited troops close to front lines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing servicemen later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas and in Kharkiv region. “Thousands of Ukrainians have given their lives so that the day might come when not a single occupying soldier will remain in our land and when all our people will be free,” Zelenskiy said. The Kremlin said Putin met senior officials Tuesday to discuss “domestic security” and said that Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. US lawmakers agreed to provide Ukraine at least $800m in additional security assistance next year, according to a summary of an $858bn defense policy bill unveiled on Tuesday, Reuters reported. At least 20 oil tankers queuing off Turkey face more delays to cross from Russia’s Black Sea ports to the Mediterranean as operators race to adhere to new Turkish insurance rules added ahead of a G7 price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reported citing industry sources. The disruption in tanker traffic was not the result of the price cap on Russian oil agreed by a coalition of G7 countries and Australia, an official with the group said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/03/conservatives-insist-policies-to-cut-emissions-drive-up-power-bills-theres-net-zero-evidence-for-that","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T00:31:23Z","webTitle":"Conservatives insist policies to cut emissions drive up power bills. There’s net zero evidence for that | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/03/conservatives-insist-policies-to-cut-emissions-drive-up-power-bills-theres-net-zero-evidence-for-that","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/03/conservatives-insist-policies-to-cut-emissions-drive-up-power-bills-theres-net-zero-evidence-for-that","fields":{"bodyText":"For months conservative politicians and commentators in Australia and around the globe have been desperate to link the world’s energy crisis to policies to get greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. By blaming the energy crisis on net zero policies, commentators have laid the fears and suffering of people around the world at the feet of climate advocates, the UN and any government with even the most moderate climate goals. Some have screamed an “apocalypse” is coming if Australia pushes for net zero, pointing to Europe’s energy crisis as a harbinger of the supposed doom to come. But last week, those famous greenies at the International Energy Agency – the world’s most influential energy policy organisation – tried to put those arguments to bed. In its annual World Energy Outlook, the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, wrote: “Faster clean energy transitions would have helped to moderate the impact of this crisis, and they represent the best way out of it.” Despite energy analysts saying rising power costs in Australia – and around the world – are due to the cost of gas and coal on international markets, conservatives have consistently made a link to net zero policies. Last month in the Australian, Nick Cater, the executive director of the Liberal party-aligned Menzies Research Centre, wrote that the cost of energy had gone up “in every country” that had tried to move away from fossil fuels, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On an almost daily basis, the Nationals senator and former resources minister Matt Canavan links net zero policies to the pain caused by rising energy costs. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech last week that in Europe “countries are rationing power” and electricity and gas bills were “spiralling out of control”, with pensioners and low-income families having to choose between paying power bills and eating. According to Dutton, this was “not only because of the invasion of Ukraine, but because governments in several countries in recent years have made catastrophic energy decisions” and had turned off generators “before the technology and system are ready for more renewable energy”. So what does the IEA have to say on all this? Birol said analysis for the agency’s report should “dispel some of the mistaken and misleading ideas” that the current crisis “is somehow a clean energy crisis”. “That is simply not true. The world is struggling with too little clean energy, not too much,” he wrote. “When people misleadingly blame climate and clean energy for today’s crisis, what they are doing – whether they mean to or not – is shifting attention away from the real cause: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” Experts have told this column that it is the spiralling costs of gas and coal that have underpinned rising prices here, because Australia’s power prices are linked to global commodity markets. The IEA said in the most affected regions “higher shares of renewables were correlated with lower electricity prices, and more efficient homes and electrified heat have provided an important buffer for some – but far from enough – consumers”. Russia is the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporter. As countries looked to source oil, gas and coal from elsewhere, this caused a huge spike in costs that continues to reverberate around the globe. But costs had been rising even before Putin’s invasion. “Climate policies were blamed in some quarters for contributing to the initial run‐up in prices, but it is difficult to argue that they played a significant role,” the IEA report said. “In fact, more rapid deployment of clean energy sources and technologies would have helped to protect consumers and mitigate some of the upward pressure on fuel prices.” The report listed a host of factors contributing to rising prices, including the speed of the economic rebound from the pandemic, droughts in Brazil cutting hydropower, heatwaves in France cutting nuclear output, flooding affecting Australian coal production, and failures by governments to introduce policies to increase clean energy investments. But could net zero policies have held back investment in fossil fuels? Was this helping to drive up prices even further? There was, the IEA said, “scant evidence to support the notion that net zero emissions pledges have stifled traditional investments in supply, as these pledges are not yet correlated with changes in fossil fuel spending”. In 68 countries and the EU where net zero pledges did exist, the IEA analysis showed, fossil fuel investments were at similar levels to 2016. Changes in investment levels in net zero countries in more recent years were “not noticeably different” from those countries with net zero pledges. What is the likelihood that the IEA’s report prompted conservatives to pull the plug on their anti-net zero rhetoric? Not likely at all. Safeguard scheming “Emission impossible” read the headline on page one of the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, with a story claiming “tens of thousands of jobs” were at risk from the Albanese government’s revamp of a failed Morrison government emissions reduction policy. The story finds four company submissions to the government’s consultation process on changes to the safeguard mechanism that complain they may not be able to reduce emissions fast enough to avoid paying a penalty under the scheme. Glencore – predominantly a coalminer – complains some of its facilities may have to close (considering how all analysis shows coal’s days are numbered as the world decarbonises, this is hardly a shock). Alcoa, BlueScope and Opal express doubts they can cut emissions fast enough. But what the story doesn’t mention is the government’s $15bn national reconstruction fund or the $1.9bn Powering the Regions fund that are, in part, designed to advance technologies to cut emissions in sectors like this. Nor does it mention that Glencore, Bluescope and Alcoa all have net zero targets by 2050. Mining giant BHP, with 17 facilities in the safeguard scheme, sees little problem with reaching the targets under the scheme, according to its submission. Not mentioned by the Daily Telegraph either is that the safeguard mechanism – covering the 215 biggest polluting facilities – was introduced by the Coalition and designed to eventually cut emissions from heavy industry. So far it has failed. Industrial emissions went up under the Coalition as many companies were allowed to have their pollution limits raised without penalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T08:46:40Z","webTitle":"From solar power for renters to detector dogs – 10 budget measures you may have missed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","fields":{"bodyText":"The October 2022 budget has been touted as largely a “bread-and-butter affair” but some unexpected areas have managed to secure a slice of the economic pie. Here are 10 measures you might have missed in Labor’s first budget. 1. Beef Week If comments from the Coalition may have had the nation quivering at the theoretical end of the Aussie barbecue as we know it, the federal government’s commitment of $12.3m over the next three years to sponsor regional trade events should be cause for calm. Beef Australia 2024, Casino Beef Week, the second Dairy Symposium and LambEx are among the major conferences to win big in the budget. 2. Scam crackdowns In a sign of the times, Labor has committed $12.6m over the next four years to crack down on scams and online fraud. The funding includes $9.9m over the next four years for the establishment of a “national anti-scam centre” by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Separately, the federal government has promised $5.5m for the office of the Australian information commissioner to investigate the Optus data breach. 3. ‘Jet zero’ planes The real winner in the October budget may be plane puns. The federal government will funnel spending into establishing a “jet zero”-style council to encourage emissions reduction in the aviation industry. It’s part of $139.9m over three years to support the sector – including upgrading Hobart airport and border facilities at Newcastle and western Sydney’s international airports. 4. Dog detectors Labradors in training and fans of Border Security rejoice – the federal government has committed $11.7m over the next four years for expanded detector dog capability at Australia’s borders. From 2026 an additional $3.3m a year has been promised to train up sniffer dogs well into the future. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup 5. Climate change health risk In a frank acknowledgement of the health risks posed by the climate crisis, Labor is committing $3.4m over the next four years then $700,000 a year to establish a “national health sustainability and climate unit”. The body will coordinate climate change responses across the health system. 6. Toy libraries Free haircuts and expanding toy libraries are part of $12.7m committed to the Department of Social Services over the next four years to “improve access to services that enhance community wellbeing”. It’s the first budget that has raised “wellbeing” as a measurable factor. The bulk will be funnelled into community playgroups and toy libraries, including new First Nations and intergenerational playgroups, while $350,000 will be rolled out to Short Back and Sidewalks, which provide free haircuts to people experiencing homelessness. 7. Solar power for renters Renters may finally be able to address their ballooning power bills. A $102.2m community solar banks program will improve access to clean energy technologies among underrepresented communities including social housing, apartments, rentals and households traditionally unable to access rooftop solar. The four-year funding commitment has been redirected from savings found in Labor’s government spending audit. 8. Targeting anti-vaxxers In a sign the pandemic isn’t behind us, $41.8m has been allocated for “communication activities” to drive uptake of the Covid vaccine, with specific focus on those with “lower access to mainstream media” and Australians at risk of severe disease. It’s part of $355.8m in funding for the distribution of Covid vaccines, with particular emphasis on administering the fourth dose to vulnerable communities. 9. Supporting seafood workers Commercial fishers and seafood workers read on. The Seafood Industry Australia’s Stay Afloat program is receiving $1.5m over the next two years to roll out 50 hubs in Australian fishing communities to provide mental health and wellbeing support. 10. LGBTIQA+ health services To address barriers to healthcare in the LGBTIQA+ community, $1.3m has been committed over a two-year period to fund peak community organisations consulting with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and asexual Australians. Additional funding will also be provided to QLife to recruit volunteer peer support workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/03/britains-defence-policy-putin-ben-wallace","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T15:38:33Z","webTitle":"Britain’s defence policy is not British, not defensive and not even a policy.

It has been more than 10 years in the planning and £5.5bn in the building, but it doesn’t work. Its tracks suffer from speed bumps and its interior keeps injuring its drivers. If I were the mythological warrior Ajax, I would sue for my reputation. It is nearly a quarter-century since Tony Blair unveiled his doctrine of so-called humanitarian interventionism. This was in support of the UN’s grandiose declaration of a “responsibility to protect” human beings everywhere. As Margaret Thatcher had liberated the Falklanders, so Blair would liberate Kosovans, Iraqis, Afghans and Sierra Leonians. The UK now has military bases in 42 overseas countries, from Oman to Mali, from Kenya to Belize, an outreach shared with no other European state. An ever-powerful defence industry lobby has since kept British defence spending at around 2% of GDP, supposedly an indication of military might sufficient to deter an aggressor. This deterrent is now being tested by Vladimir Putin. His attack on Ukraine is presented by hawks as a threat to Nato and the entire west. Though the nuclear deterrent is holding, that of Nato’s implied conventional response did not, at least a year ago. Putin appears to have validated decades of warnings by defence historians that the cold war will never be over. Russia must be seen as an ever-present enemy; Putin agrees. Just as Nato risked confrontation in advancing east in the 1990s, he felt justified in advancing into Chechnya, Georgia and Donbas. It is not so much cold war as old war and it has left Whitehall floundering. Is defence really about global influence or rather about Nato solidity – and if the latter, how should the money be spent? Britain’s procurement of extravagant weapons feeds the vanity of politicians of all parties . Aircraft carriers were supposed to be phased out in the 1960s with the end of empire. Blair authorised their reinstatement in 1998 for expeditionary power projection (after a defence review on which I served). David Cameron refused to cancel them in 2010. Johnson recently sent one of these dinosaurs, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the South China Sea. Another, HMS Prince of Wales, was meant to help boost trade down the east coast of America. It broke down at sea and returned to port. Both have to use US planes, with US permission. In the same company is the Ajax armoured vehicle, the Lightning fighter jets, the £31bn Dreadnought submarines, Project Mensa for nuclear infrastructure and the Morpheus military communications system. One follows another into wild overspend and delay. For a medium-sized European power this is beyond parody. Each year the defence secretary has to plead or bully Downing Street for more cash while their department shows incompetence that would have an NHS trust in special measures overnight. It is hard to quarrel with the defence analyst Paul Rogers’ description of these weapons as no more than “delusions of post-imperial grandeur”. Every country needs defending, even one as ostensibly secure from territorial threat as the UK. This operates at two levels. It means an army aiding civil authority in a crisis, be it riot, terrorism or pandemic. Covid saw 20,000 soldiers on stand-by. Beyond that, an army is needed to support alliance activities, primarily Nato. Here the commitment is more discretionary. That Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constitutes a true existential threat to all of Europe is absurd. But it certainly threatens frontier states to which Nato boldly offered absolute security guarantees. Either way it must cause those, like myself, who saw no point in nuclear deterrence, to pause. To what extent Britain should be tooled up for a land war in Europe is a dilemma that any non-expert must find hard to resolve. One thing is for sure: for all the glamour of ships and planes, it is armies that matter. But what matters even more than their size is the politics of their deployment. Two years ago, the US soldier and academic Sean McFate dared to ask Why the West Doesn’t Win Wars. His answer lay not in soldiers or their equipment. It lay in the decisions – so often bombastic, reckless and thoughtless – that drove them to war in the first place. Putin’s war on Ukraine has shown the same weakness as did the west’s war against the Taliban: that no force is more powerful than the will to defend one’s own soil. Largely for this reason, it has been estimated that four wars in 10 are won by militarily the weaker side. The British government has decided to cut its army by nearly 10,000 troops. No layperson can judge what impact this may have on operational effectiveness – let alone deterrent value – because the “operation” is conjectural. It still leaves a force of 73,000 ground troops. There is talk of this being insufficient to take over from Germany in leading Nato’s high-readiness command. It has left the Tory defence select committee chairman, Tobias Ellwood, calling it “a reduction in our hard power that would diminish our international standing and ability to sway opinion on the world stage”. I could say the same of Brexit. What shines through these arguments is a divergence between these images of 20th-century conflict and what defence may mean in the future. Russia has been proved weak on the battlefield, but not in its cyberwar, domestic brainwashing, diplomatic manipulation and resistance to sanctions. Its hold is unyielding on Iran, Syria and certain countries in Africa. Threats are also changing. The seas have become as permeable as the skies. Unmanned weapons enable armies to go further and be more reckless. Drones are transformational, except in occupying territory. Even here soldiers are being supplanted by mercenaries. The Russians use prisoners most effectively. Half the Americans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan were contractors. Much in today’s defence debate hinges on how a Labour government will respond. It has long been terrified of cutting defence, of being portrayed as weak or appeasing. At very least Keir Starmer may snap out of Britain’s “post-imperial” delusion. Modern defence should be what it says on the tin: about defence. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has recently spoken of taking it “budget by budget”, seemingly de-escalating the arms race. He sounded at least common sensical. Perhaps for the first time in decades, Britain’s defence has what it most needs: a secretary of state for sanity. • This article was amended on 5 March 2023.

Now 38, Harry will publish Spare next week. Amid reports of highly restrictive security around the release of the book, the Guardian obtained a copy. The description of the visit to the woman – about whom Harry does not use words like “psychic” or “medium” – comes late in the 400-page book, amid the prince’s account of his marriage to Meghan Markle, an American actor, and troubled relations with the royal family including what he says was a physical attack against him by his brother, Prince William. Harry writes about his mother and his grief throughout his book, at one point describing repeated drives through the tunnel in Paris in which she died, in an attempt to understand what happened. His account of what he says was a conversation with his dead mother is short. Harry, who now lives in Los Angeles, does not say where the meeting happened, or when. He does not name the woman involved. The prince says he “recognised the high-percentage chance of humbuggery” but went to meet the woman because trusted friends recommended her. “The minute we sat down together,” he writes, “I felt an energy around her.” The prince says the woman told him she felt an energy around him too, and said: “Your mother is with you.” Harry replied: “I know. I’ve felt that of late.” The woman, he writes, told him his mother was with him “right now”. Harry says his neck grew warm and his eyes watered. The woman told Harry his mother knew he was “looking for clarity” and “feels your confusion”, and knew he had “so many questions”, and said answers would come in time. The prince also says the woman told him Diana said: “You’re living the life she couldn’t. You’re living the life she wanted for you.” Harry, who in his book also describes endless clashes with the press amid trips to London clubs and visits to Africa, Europe and Hollywood, and admits to regular drinking and drug-taking, says he wanted to believe the woman but needed “proof. A sign. Anything.” One such sign offered by the woman involved a story about an ornament, and a claim that his mother knew about it because “she was there”. Earlier in the book, Harry recounts how a Christmas tree ornament in the shape of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was accidentally smashed by his son, Archie. The woman, he writes, repeated that his mother was there when the incident happened, saying: “Your mother says … something about a Christmas ornament? Of a mother? Or a grandmother? It fell? Broke?” Harry said: “Archie tried to fix it.” The woman said: “Your mother says she had a bit of a giggle about that.” After the Guardian broke the first details of Spare on Wednesday night, the book briefly appeared for sale in Spain, leading to other news outlets obtaining copies.
