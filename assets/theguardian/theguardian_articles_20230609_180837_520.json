The Pacific country is waiting for its president to recall parliament so lawmakers can vote for a new prime minister after a national election showed no party received a clear majority. A coalition of three parties say they have a combined majority and have agreed on the People’s Alliance leader, Sitiveni Rabuka, as prime minister. Fiji First and the incumbent prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, have not conceded defeat. Both men have led coups in the past. Opposition parties have disputed reports – cited by police and Bainimarama as reason to bring in the military – that businesses or homes of Fiji’s large ethnic Indian population have been targeted or stoned in the wake of the election. The opposition groups have called for evidence of this. At a media conference on Thursday, the National Federation party leader, Biman Prasad, said Fiji First’s secretary general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who was the attorney general in Bainimarama’s government, was “trying to create fear in the minds of people” and should accept the election result. “He is not accepting they lost this election, people voted for change,” Prasad said. The police commissioner, Sitiveni Qiliho, said a decision had been made to call in the military after he met with Bainimarama as well as the minister for defence and policing, Inia Seruiratu, and the military commander, Maj Gen Jone Kalouniwai. “We came to an agreement for RFMF personnel to assist police with the maintenance of law and order, amidst growing concerns of racial tension,” a statement published on Thursday read. Qiliho said the decision was based on reports received that “minority groups continue to be targeted and information of planned civil unrest received”. The police commissioner also cited “threats made against minority groups who are now living in fear following recent political developments”. “While the army and navy personnel have been called in to assist, police will continue to lead the overall security operations,” he added. Bainimarama issued a statement saying the military had been deployed to complement the police in maintaining law and order. “The reports of harassment suffered by our citizens and violence targeted at Indo-Fijian homes and businesses in the wake of the election are deeply disturbing,” he said in a Facebook post. Fiji’s president, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, has until 2 January to summon parliament, media outlet Fiji Village reported, citing a letter sent by Katonivere to the coalition partners. The prime minister must be voted in by more than 50% of lawmakers on the parliament floor. Bainimarama and Rabuka were initially deadlocked after the election. Rabuka’s People’s Alliance Party won 21 seats and the affiliated National Federation Party won five seats, while Bainimarama’s Fiji First party secured 26 seats. That left Sodelpa, which won three seats, holding the balance of power. The party decided on Tuesday in a close 16-14 internal vote to go with Rabuka – a vote that Fiji First is now questioning. The Pacific island country, with a population of 900,000, had a history of military coups before constitutional reform in 2013 to remove a race-based voting system that favoured indigenous Fijians over ethnic Indians. In 2006, Bainimarama instigated a coup and was installed as prime minister the year after, before leading Fiji First to majority government at the 2014 and 2018 democratic elections. Rabuka is a former prime minister who instigated a coup in 1987 before bringing back democratic elections in 1992 and led the country through to 1999. The Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), a power-broker holding three seats in the hung parliament, supports policies favouring indigenous Fijians, and on Tuesday signed a coalition agreement with Rabuka’s People’s Alliance and the National Federation Party. However Sodelpa’s board must meet again, after the validity of the decision to back the coalition was challenged by the party’s general secretary and Fiji’s supervisor of elections. Sayed-Khaiyum, from the governing Fiji First party, lashed out at Rabuka, accusing him of sowing division in Fiji. “The entire rationale of this man has been to divide Fiji to gain political supremacy,” Sayed-Khaiyum said. “And we can see that simmering through again. In fact it’s not simmering, it’s boiling.” A day earlier, Rabuka and two other party leaders announced they were forming a coalition with a total of 29 seats against Fiji First’s 26 and would form the next government. “A government we hope that will bring the change that people had been calling out for over the last few years,” Rabuka said at a news conference. “It’s going to be an onerous task. It will not be easy, and it was never easy to try and dislodge an incumbent government. We have done that, collectively.” Rabuka’s announcement had prompted the New Zealand foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, to send her congratulations on Twitter, saying New Zealand “looks forward to working together to continue strengthening our warm relationship”. But the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, took a more cautious approach, saying she was waiting until the dust settled.

The Oxford English Dictionary added 26 Korean words. The K-pop band BTS has topped charts internationally and met Joe Biden at the White House this summer. After sweeping through Asia years ago, hallyu – the “Korean wave” of culture – has crashed upon western shores too, as documented in a new exhibition at the V&amp;A in London. This is a serious business. A recent book, Shrimp to Whale, plays on an old saying portraying Korea as a tiny creature surrounded by leviathans and captures its triumphant postwar ascent from abject poverty and trauma. South Korea still regards itself as a middle power. But in economics, technology and especially culture it is now a powerhouse. One government source jokes that soft power – a country’s ability to get what it wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment – is the South’s nuclear weapon. Joseph Nye, who coined the term soft power in the late 1980s, has suggested that it depends on a nation’s culture, political values and foreign policies. Building it is not as straightforward as amassing the bombs and tanks required for hard power. China has invested heavily in soft-power initiatives, but has yet to produce a Blackpink or Snowpiercer. Its determination to micromanage cultural projects hampers the ability to appeal to foreign audiences. (Prof Nye has suggested that its influence will remain limited for as long as it “fans the flames of nationalism and holds tight the reins of party control”). In contrast, democratic South Korea has pursued an arm’s-length approach, modelled partly on UK initiatives such as the British Council. Squid Game and the Oscar-winning Parasite hardly shed a flattering light on the nation that produced them: they have triumphed by capturing the monstrous cruelties and inequality of modern capitalism there, in a way that has resonated more widely. The strategy is a recognition that soft power belongs to nations, not governments. The origins of South Korea’s status as a cultural behemoth are complex. But if the state can take some credit, civil society should take more. There was outrage in 2016 when it emerged that then-president Park Geun-hye’s administration had blacklisted thousands of artists and entertainers – a reversion to the kind of censorship and punishment once seen under authoritarian leaders, including Ms Park’s father. It is the people who have nurtured, promoted and defended media and artistic independence. Globally, this is an era in which diplomatic platitudes have been stripped away, and force laid bare once more. Nationalist strongmen are in charge around the world. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was the ultimate assertion of hard power. Yet the video addresses by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has so consummately inhabited the role of war leader; the sharing of daily life by citizens; even the defiant humour of postage stamps have all helped to bolster public support for Ukraine in other countries. In doing so, they have helped to maintain the political will to keep supplying it with heavy weaponry in the face of Russian menace. Soft power is hard to define and harder to master. But it counts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-01T05:20:25Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: a powerful end to one of the best new cop shows in ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","fields":{"bodyText":"Blue Lights 9pm, BBC One After last week’s Operation Farset disaster, the final episode is spent praying for Gerry (Richard Dormer) to pull through – and it’s a powerful end to what has been an excellent new cop show.

Macron spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday and said the call was necessary because of the urgent nuclear threat to Europe. Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents. “The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said. Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown. Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato. The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement. Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity. On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said. Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war. “Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter. Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm. The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems. The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter. “The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.” Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”. “The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.” He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said. “They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.

Russia’s permanent representative to the body, Vasily Nebenzya, told Interfax on Friday that Moscow must “protect” the Zaporizhzhia plant. A withdrawal of its troops would make the facility “vulnerable … to provocations and terrorist attacks”, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had earlier called for all military personnel and equipment to be pulled out, saying the plant “should not be used as part of any military operations” and a demilitarised zone needed to be agreed. Both the US and France backed Guterres’ appeal. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, said officials must visit the plant as soon as possible. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour,” Grossi told the UN security council. Ukraine and Russia on Friday accused each other of risking nuclear catastrophe at the plant, which lies on the opposite bank of a reservoir from several Ukrainian-held towns and cities that have come under intense shelling from the Russian-held side. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said Ukraine was shelling the plant itself. “They say it’s Russia,” he wrote on Telegram. “That’s obviously 100% nonsense, even for the stupid Russophobic public.” Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, added: “They say it happens purely by chance, like ‘we didn’t mean to’. What can I say? Let’s not forget that the European Union also has nuclear power plants. And accidents can happen there, too.” Ukraine’s Energoatom agency, whose workers still operate the plant under Russian occupation, said it was struck five times on Thursday, including near where radioactive materials are stored. Kyiv said Russian troops struck it themselves, and were also using the plant as a shield to provide cover while they bombard nearby Ukrainian-held towns and cities. “The Ukrainian armed forces do not damage the infrastructure [of the plant], do not strike where there may be a danger on a global scale,” the army spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told national television. “We understand that the invaders are hiding behind such a shield because it is not possible to strike there.” Earlier this week, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, in the knowledge it would be too dangerous for Ukraine to return fire. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, demanded Russia return the plant to Ukraine’s control. “Only a full withdrawal of the Russians … and the restoration of full Ukrainian control of the situation around the station can guarantee a resumption of nuclear security for all of Europe,” he said in his latest video address. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, has previously warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster, he said, adding that “such insane actions could lead to … a Fukushima or Chornobyl”. Grossi said he was ready to lead an international expert mission to inspect the site in south-eastern Ukraine and called on Russia and Ukraine to cooperate so officials could travel as soon as possible. “Time is of the essence,” he told the 15-member security council late on Thursday, adding that the agency could perform urgent work on safeguards and provide a stabilising influence in order “to prevent a nuclear accident”. Fighting has intensified in recent days in anticipation of what Ukraine says is a planned counteroffensive in the south. The country’s general staff on Friday reported shelling and air attacks by Russian forces on scores of towns and bases. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the eastern Donetsk region, said on Telegram seven civilians had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours. Britain’s defence ministry said on Friday that explosions earlier this week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea were “almost certainly” the result of the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas. It did not say what the exact cause of the blasts was but said at least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets appeared to have been destroyed or seriously damaged.

The prime minister used a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to provide an assurance that the government was “working around the clock to deliver a solution” and to flag collaboration with the states. “Just as we brought state and territory governments together to take urgent action to keep the lights on in our first month in office, I’m confident we will be able to reach agreement on a plan that delivers for every part of Australia,” Albanese said on Wednesday night. Guardian Australia revealed on Monday the Albanese government may struggle to provide comprehensive energy price relief unless NSW and Queensland cooperate with a plan to temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal. The government is looking at price cap options to assist industrial users of gas and households battling a surge in their power bills. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, briefed cabinet on the components of the proposed intervention on Monday, including possible price caps for gas and coal. The Albanese government is confident it has the regulatory levers to reduce gas prices for industrial users, but there is concern a replica intervention in the coal market might be more complex for Canberra to execute, and could open the possibility of legal challenges given producers will resist. Gas price relief can be achieved through tweaking existing federal mechanisms, such as the industry code of conduct, but interventions in the coal market are normally driven by the states. Reporting of the deliberation in Canberra prompted the Queensland premier to fire a public warning shot at Albanese. On Tuesday, she used an answer in state parliament to declare the federal government needed to keep “hands off our generators”. The energy package is still the subject of internal deliberations. Albanese is looking to land the long telegraphed regulatory intervention around the time of a looming national cabinet meeting in early December. Asked on ABC’s 7:30 about a gas price cap of $11 to $13 a gigajoule, Albanese said the government would “take action” by Christmas but he “won’t speculate on the figures that are floating around”. “What we’re determined to do is to undertake measures that put downward pressure on costs, whether that be for business or for households.” Albanese said the speculation of government intervention had already caused “some downward pressure”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In question time on Wednesday, the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, labelled the energy policy “half baked”, and accused the industry minister, Ed Husic, of not being able to explain its details in a morning interview. Ley questioned if the government was “giving false hope to Australians about lowering power prices”. Albanese responded that her question was based on a “range of false premises” and defended Husic’s refusal to discuss detail by explaining he could not reveal cabinet discussions. “The second point I will make is: I love Queensland as well,” Albanese said, echoing Husic’s interview. “The cabinet is dealing with these issues. The minister for industry is diligently consulting with the manufacturing sector in particular.” Before his election in May Albanese promised to be pro-entrepreneurship and to listen, if not always agree, with business. Albanese’s relationship with the business sector has been tested by Labor’s ambitious secure jobs, better pay bill, and the inclusion of options for multi-employer pay deals. The bill prompted revolt from employer groups over a lack of safeguards preventing all but the smallest businesses being drawn into pay deals without their consent. Further safeguards for small and medium businesses were added as part of a deal with Senator David Pocock that was expected to guarantee the bill’s passage this week. Albanese told Acci on Wednesday evening he was “aware that there are elements of our plan with which you disagree”. “No significant economic reform has ever enjoyed 100% support.” Albanese argued that “one point of disagreement” on industrial relations need not “define our every interaction”. “Our relationship is bigger than that, more important than that. Consensus, in the end, depends on a common goal.” Albanese cited the common goals of “strong employment growth, higher incomes growth, improved productivity and enhanced social inclusion” agreed at the jobs and skills summit. He said government and business had made “substantial progress” in areas including vocational education, cheaper childcare, manufacturing, trade, and cleaner, cheaper energy. “We will continue to seek your cooperation, your insights and your expertise as we confront emerging challenges.” Albanese signalled greater cooperation to “guard against cybersecurity threats”. “Clearly, our national capacity isn’t where it needs to be – and that’s a serious issue for any business or government that holds people’s private information. “Whether it’s cybersecurity or energy or skills or infrastructure or international trade, I know there is so much we can achieve if we work together. “I’m proud of what we’ve delivered over the past six months – and I’m looking forward to what the future holds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"The nuclear threat might change the mood in Russia itself, stoking widespread fear | Peter Pomerantsev","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","fields":{"bodyText":"‘Do you want Total War?” Goebbels demanded of the Nazi faithful as the Second World War went south for Germany in 1943. He depicted a Reich surrounded by evil Jewish cosmopolitan conspirators bent on its destruction and he advocated for total mobilisation and to embrace a glory-in-death ideology. Vladimir Putin delivered his own (partial) version last week. As the Ukraine war goes south for Russia, he claimed the defeats are the result of cosmopolitan conspiracies bent on destroying Russia and he had to announce (partial) total mobilisation. He called on Russians’ sense of historical mission and implied Russia was ready to use nuclear weapons. “This isn’t a bluff,” he insisted. Putin likes to imitate the worst of 20th-century totalitarian propaganda, but does his message work, at home and abroad? Or is Putin starting to make the same propaganda blunders he made on the battlefield? Russian state propaganda drips with the pathos of martyrdom. Russians are meant to love the pain of proving how tough they are, surviving everything from the Gulag to the extreme weather, as compared with the effete west. The propaganda taps incessantly into the myth of the Second World War, in which Russians are described as unique among nations in their readiness to sacrifice themselves for a greater cause. On the anniversary of that war, the state organises marches where people carry placards of dead veterans, “the immortal regiment”: death in war brings immortality in the heaven of state propaganda. There’s a suicidal bravura, a “let’s destroy the whole world” implication in the popular catchphrase “What’s the point of the world if there’s no place for Russia in it?”. Putin’s nuclear threats are snarled with relish, as if sadistically summoning the Gods of Total Destruction. As with the Nazis, rational self-interest is meant to be swallowed up in the community of the state. But look closer and the picture gets more complicated – and vulnerable. The myth of martyrdom and resilience is suspect. Ukrainians have a genuine tradition of suffering for the cause of national liberation – and success through sacrifice. For centuries, Ukrainian poets and rebels proved themselves ready to bear unjust imprisonment, executions and genocide to fight for their national and linguistic rights. Many of Ukraine’s heroes, such as the poets Taras Shevchenko and Vasyl Stus, suffered Russian prisons and tortures, and their underlying spirit of resilience is being proved on the battlefield. Russians have indeed been killed en masse, most often by their own state, but, unlike Ukrainians, they do not celebrate their own dissidents. These are hated and damned in state propaganda and by the public at large. Real courage is derided. Instead, mass oppression has resulted in a society that celebrates passive conformism. Bravura is celebrated on the screen, but as a way to compensate for the way society is actually cowed. You are crushed by the state and then compensated with patriotic heroics on television and sadism towards the weakest in your own society and others (in this case, Ukraine). The great difference with Nazi propaganda is that while the former was geared to action and mobilisation, Putin’s propaganda is geared to demobilisation: sit on the couch, feel strong by watching propaganda and let the Kremlin run things. Beneath the rhetoric of self-sacrifice, Putin’s propaganda has traditionally allowed for self-interest or, at least, self-preservation. You go to war spouting patriotic rhetoric, but really you are in it because it allows for loot and rape. You enjoy the highs of patriotic rhetoric at home, but really your interest is in being allowed to pursue corruption, great and small. Putin’s trick is to dress self-interest in patriotic propaganda. Now those two things are splitting. Going to the front just means pointless death. It’s now clear the “partial” mobilisation is not partial at all; people are being grabbed on the streets and packed off to war. On social media, the sentiment towards mobilisation is highly negative. In polling, even the most pro-Putin Russians are against it. The war in Ukraine was meant to be a movie, not a personal sacrifice. Putin’s threat of nuclear war may backfire, too. It’s meant to intimidate the west and Ukraine but it can upset his own people more. If there’s one thing Russians fear more than Putin, it’s nuclear war – and now he’s the one bringing it closer. For both the elite and the “ordinary” Russians who I’ve spoken to recently, the calculation is about whether the risk of going against Putin is bigger than the risk of sticking with him. So far, rebelling has seemed the bigger risk; does the nuclear topic change that? Much depends on how the international community reacts. We need to show that the closer he gets to a nuclear threat, the more devastating the reaction will be: military, economic and diplomatic. He will even lose China. Losing public opinion in Russia is not the same as in a democracy. It doesn’t necessarily lead to protests, let alone losing non-existent elections. But being able to show you can control public opinion, through fear and propaganda, is one of the emblems of tsardom. Putin has lost control of the military situation. Losing control of propaganda will show that beneath the shiny fascist boots are feet of clay. Now stamp on them. • Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a revealing quote during a meeting last week with about a hundred academics from 40 countries, Putin rejected it. Fyodor Lukyanov, a highly respected thinktank editor who was the meeting’s moderator, had the courage to ask the Russian president if he would retreat like the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev did in the 1962 Cuban crisis. “Certainly not,” Putin replied. To general laughter, according to the Kremlin transcript, he went on: “I cannot imagine myself in the role of Khrushchev. No way.” The amusement was presumably prompted not just by the physical and attitudinal contrast between Putin, the cold disciplinarian and fitness freak, and Khrushchev, the pot-bellied and jolly reformer who ruled Russia erratically after Stalin’s death. Everyone remembered how Khrushchev was dumped out of power by his colleagues two years after the Cuban adventure. Putin’s comment leaves us facing the bleakest of scenarios. We now have no prospect of unilateral Russian retreat. It comes on top of the grim reality that there is no basis for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since Putin made the stupid mistake in September of annexing four Ukrainian provinces, thereby undermining any chance of mutual concessions and an agreed pull-back, since the Russian parliament now considers the regions part of Russia. As the fighting has intensified, both sides have increased their demands and hardened their positions. Back in March, a month after the Russian invasion, a deal was possible. Putin had recognised his dispatch of troops to occupy Kyiv and effect regime change had failed on the battlefield. Reports suggest Putin mainly wanted Ukraine to renounce its ambition to join Nato and accept autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk, in line with the Minsk agreements of 2015. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, was willing to consider Russia’s demands in exchange for a ceasefire and a Russian withdrawal, while the status of Crimea was left for later discussion. That did not happen. Enter Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, their interventions, and the sense that what had been a war to defend and restore Ukraine’s sovereignty had became a proxy war between the west and Russia. And at the back of it all lurks the nuclear mushroom cloud. Not since 1962 has the world been in such danger. The crisis of October 1962 was worse than today’s confrontation in one key respect. The working assumption was that any use of force by the US president, John F Kennedy, to stop Soviet ships carrying nuclear-tipped missiles to Cuba would quickly escalate into a launch of nuclear weapons at American and Soviet cities. Both superpowers put their arsenals on high alert. The world faced the existential threat of global suicide. In today’s crisis the talk is of using so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Tactical is an elastic concept, of course, and today’s US nuclear bombs, like the B61s that Biden is sending to US bases in Britain, are 30 times as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima. The Pentagon released the unclassified sections of its long-delayed Nuclear Posture Review last week. They show that efforts by arms control experts to persuade the Biden administration to support “no first use” have failed. The US will not abandon its longstanding readiness to escalate to the nuclear level and respond with nuclear weapons to a non-nuclear conventional attack. Russian doctrine is depressingly similar, and Putin has said he will use whatever weaponry is needed if Russian territory comes under attack. Biden has shown some restraint. He has resisted Ukrainian requests for long-range rockets that could hit Russian cities and provoke an all-out war between Russian and Nato forces. He has turned down Zelenskiy’s call for Nato to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He has not sent US troops to Ukraine, and made sure no other Nato country sends troops either. But even though the risks of a quick slide into all-out nuclear war are less today than in 1962, there are other dangers inherent in today’s crisis that make it more alarming. First among them is the absence of any negotiating forum or an agenda for mutual concessions. Both sides want military victory and are lured by the mirage that it is obtainable. There is not even a basis for a ceasefire, since each side is sure its opponent will use a truce to train more troops, obtain more weaponry and regroup its forces into better positions. In 1962 there was a relatively simple basis for de-escalating and resolving the crisis quickly. Khrushchev’s dispatch of nuclear missiles to Cuba was not prompted by strategic necessity or the need to defend Soviet territory. It was a gamble and an effort to achieve strategic parity with US power on the cheap. Faced with Kennedy’s determination to use force, Khrushchev could and did make a U-turn. To make it less humiliating for him, and give the impression of mutual concessions, Kennedy publicly pledged not to invade Cuba. He also agreed to withdraw the outdated medium-range Jupiter missiles that were deployed close to the Soviet border in Turkey. As a gesture of goodwill Khrushchev offered not to publicise this US concession. After 13 days of nail-biting tension, the 1962 crisis ended with a breath of common sense and statecraft on both sides. If only the same qualities could be revived over Ukraine today.

The defence ministry’s statement on Friday was Moscow’s first admission that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around the largely destroyed eastern Ukrainian city Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done most of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” that had seen troops flee. He said via his press service that Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Kyiv damaged two disused factories and five homes in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, around 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. Luhansk authorities said on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian-made “grom” tactical missiles damaged or destroyed administrative buildings at a packaging plant and a factory producing cleaning materials. No casualties were reported. Two Russian pilots were killed when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. It said it believed the reason for Friday’s crash was equipment failure, Tass reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president Petr Pavel has said. The former Nato general said in an interview on Friday that Ukraine needed support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either would be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. South Africa’s foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Reuben Brigety said on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a Russian vessel, which is under sanctions, at a naval base near Cape Town in December last year and that the arms were then transported to Russia. Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine, in a phone call with his South African counterpart, according to the Kremlin. The Russian president said on Friday he supported South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, the Kremlin’s readout of the call said. Russia’s defence ministry has said Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in Thursday’s assault, it said on Friday, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the European Union will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who was meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has expressed disappointment at a decision to block Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to speak via video at Saturday’s Eurovision grand final. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the event, said the Ukrainian president had “laudable” intentions but rejected the request over fears it could politicise the event. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, underscored their support for Ukraine during a White House meeting that also touched on migration and defence cooperation. During talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden said that “together we’re supporting Ukraine” and Sanchez squarely blamed the war on Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-29T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"UK to lift import restrictions on food from Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","fields":{"bodyText":"Food from Fukushima will be freely available in the UK from Wednesday, weeks after Boris Johnson snacked on popcorn from the Japanese prefecture hit by a triple nuclear meltdown in March 2011. Britain restricted Fukushima imports after the disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, but has gradually lifted them, even as other countries limit or ban produce from the region. Johnson confirmed that the remaining restrictions would end on Wednesday in a meeting the previous day with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on the fringes of the G7 summit in Germany. Johnson told Kishida that UK-Japan relations were going from “strength to strength”. “Two great island democracies, united in our values, determined to stand up together against autocracies and the dangers of drifting backwards in the world, but also wanting to do more together on technology, on security, on trade, and of course I’m delighted that tomorrow – finally – we are able to have Fukushima-origin products all over the shops in the UK,” he said. The supermarket chains Tesco and Waitrose have said they have no immediate plans to sell Fukushima produce. Instead, many of the items will be available at Japanese restaurants and specialist Japanese stores in England, Scotland and Wales. The restrictions will remain in place in Northern Ireland, which is subject to European Union rules on food and drink from Fukushima and other prefectures affected by the accident 11 years ago. The scrapping of the restrictions was made possible after the UK Food Standards Agency dropped a limit of 100 becquerels – a measure of radioactivity – per kilogram contained in Japanese food. “Our risk assessment shows that removing the 100 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg) maximum level of radiocaesium for food imported from Japan to the UK would result in a negligible increase in dose and any associated risk to UK consumers,” the FSA said in a report late last year. The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs, such as meat and vegetables, is 100 becquerels per kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. The lifting of restrictions will affect 23 food products, such as mushrooms, which previously needed to carry proof that they had been tested for radioactive material, according to Nikkei Asia. The Japanese government said it “welcomes the fact that the UK government reached this decision based on scientific evidence, as it will support the reconstruction of the affected areas”. It added that it would “continue to work towards the early lifting of the remaining import restrictions in the EU and other countries and regions”. China, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and several other countries still impose import restrictions. Johnson first sampled Fukushima produce in 2017 when, as foreign secretary, he swigged a can of peach juice given to him by his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, declaring it “Yum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","fields":{"bodyText":"The Saudi prince was detained all night. As daylight broke, he staggered out of the king’s palace in Mecca. His personal bodyguards, who tailed him everywhere, were missing. The prince was led to a waiting car. He was free to leave – but he would soon discover that freedom was not very different from detention. As his car pulled out of the palace gates, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef fired off a series of panicked text messages. “Be very careful! Don’t come back!” he wrote to his most trusted adviser, who had quietly slipped out of the kingdom just weeks earlier. When Nayef reached his own palace in the coastal city of Jeddah a few hours later, he found new guards manning the property. It was obvious that he was being put under house arrest. “May God help us, doctor. The important thing is that you must be careful, and under no circumstances should you come back,” he wrote to the adviser. The previous night, 20 June 2017, Nayef, the king’s nephew, had been forced to step down as heir to the Saudi throne in an episode that one royal insider described to me as “Godfather, Saudi-style”. Nayef, who oversaw domestic security, was the CIA’s closest Saudi ally. Earlier that year, the then-CIA director Mike Pompeo had awarded him a medal in recognition of his counter-terrorism efforts that saved American lives. Two years before, after King Salman commenced his reign, Nayef had been made crown prince at the age of 55, putting him next in line to the throne. But simmering behind the scenes was a vicious rivalry between Nayef and his upstart cousin, the king’s son, Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, who rose from obscurity to become deputy crown prince. Shortly before the palace coup, on 5 June 2017, tensions between the princes reached boiling point after MBS and other regional autocrats imposed a punishing blockade on neighbouring Qatar. The tiny, gas-rich emirate has long rankled its bigger Arab neighbours with its provocative moves, such as giving airtime to regional Islamists and dissidents on its influential news channel Al Jazeera. Nayef, too, had issues with Qatar, but he preferred quiet diplomacy over MBS’s combative approach. Behind his cousin’s back, Nayef opened a secret channel with Qatar’s ruler Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. “Tamim called me today, but I did not answer,” Nayef texted his adviser at the peak of the crisis. “I want to send him an encrypted phone for communication.” On 20 June 2017, in the midst of that crisis, Nayef was called for a meeting in King Salman’s palace in Mecca – a marble-walled colossus overlooking the cube-shaped Ka’bah, the holiest shrine in Islam. According to sources close to Nayef, when he arrived, his security detail was instructed to wait outside. To prevent any leaks, all mobile phones, including those of the palace staff, were seized by guards loyal to MBS. One senior member of the royal family, who tried to enter the palace after Nayef, was turned away at the gates. The prince was allegedly ushered into a room with Turki al-Sheikh, a close MBS confidante with a gruff, intimidating manner and a predilection for expensive Richard Mille watches. (Sheikh would later be promoted to head the General Entertainment Authority – an agency that seeks to soften Saudi Arabia’s image by, among other things, hosting giant raves in the desert.) Sheikh allegedly confined Nayef to the room for hours, pressuring him to sign a resignation letter and pledge allegiance to MBS. At first, Nayef refused. According to one source close to the prince, he was told that if he did not give up his claim to the throne, his female family members would be raped. Nayef’s medication for hypertension and diabetes was withheld, and he was told that if he did not step down willingly, his next destination would be the hospital. He was so afraid of being poisoned that night, said another royal family source, that he refused to drink even water. Nayef was permitted to speak with two princes in the Allegiance Council, the royal body that ratifies the line of succession. He was shocked to hear that they had already submitted to MBS. By daybreak, it was all over. Anxious and exhausted, Nayef surrendered. He was made to step into an adjoining room, where MBS was waiting with television cameras and a guard carrying a gun. Footage released by Saudi broadcasters showed a brief glimpse of Sheikh hurriedly slipping a gold-trimmed robe on the back of the detained prince. As the cameras rolled, MBS crept closer to his cousin and theatrically stooped down to kiss his hand and knee. “When I pledged allegiance, there was a gun to my back,” Nayef later wrote in a text to his adviser. In the days that followed, posters of Nayef were removed from public buildings. MBS was now first in line to the throne, and effectively the most powerful man in the country at the age of 31. The octogenarian king remained head of state, but MBS became the day-to-day ruler, with absolute control over all levers of Saudi security, economy and oil. Nayef, the darling of US intelligence, who had assumed he would be the next ruler of Saudi Arabia, was now a prisoner. But for him, worse was to come. * * * The palace coup, and the power plays that led to it, were largely obscured from public view at the time, with only scraps of information – and dollops of propaganda – leaking out to the press. International media, for example, was fed what Nayef’s associates call spurious claims that he had been pushed aside in the national interest because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction. Getting at the truth is especially hard in a country where the surveillance state is so powerful that some Saudis place their phones in the refrigerator while discussing sensitive matters. The Saudi embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But a detailed account of the events of 2017, and its shocking aftermath, is now possible, thanks to a drip-feed of palace secrets by a few senior royals and other well-connected sources who have been stripped of their influence and wealth in the age of MBS and, in the worst cases, imprisoned and tortured. Key among those sources is a man named Saad Aljabri, Nayef’s closest adviser and intelligence chief. It was Aljabri whom Nayef texted immediately after he was released from the king’s palace, after the coup. Aljabri, 63, had long operated in the shadows and many who worked with him considered him the most powerful non-royal in Saudi Arabia. One former American official who worked with Aljabri for years described him to me as the “deep state liaison” between Saudi Arabia and western powers. In the years after 9/11, Aljabri had been promoted through the ranks of the interior ministry, eventually becoming head of counter-terrorism operations. Together, Aljabri and his patron, Nayef, modernised the kingdom’s security and surveillance apparatus. They have also been accused of targeting peaceful activists under the pretext of counter-terrorism and laying the foundations of the police state that MBS would later turn against them. The text messages between Nayef and Aljabri first came to light through legal filings in North America and an Interpol ruling that rejected a Saudi request to have Aljabri arrested overseas. The messages in those documents were authenticated by a digital forensics expert hired by Norton Rose Fulbright, the international law firm representing Aljabri, which is in possession of his iPhone, according to court affidavits. Aljabri’s team separately shared with me a handful of messages that have never previously been published. For decades, the throne had passed laterally between the sons of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, ensuring a delicate power balance between the various branches of the vast royal family. Nayef’s succession would have seen the crown passing to the generation below for the first time, but still to a different branch of the family, maintaining that delicate balance. But then came the palace coup – which not only shoved aside MBS’s main rival, but also destroyed the old succession model that prized seniority and consensus within the family, by setting up the passing of power directly from father to son within one branch of the family. It enabled MBS to amass more power than any previous ruler, even before he formally ascends the throne. The coup was the culmination of months of animus between MBS and Nayef. One of the major points of conflict was their competition to win favour with the new administration of President Donald Trump. People close to Nayef say he was secretly listening in on MBS’s calls with aides and allies such as Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser. The snooping helped him track MBS’s manoeuvres in Washington. The transcript of one intercepted call in the spring of 2017, which Nayef showed to Aljabri, suggested that MBS had been discussing the royal succession with Kushner. In that call, MBS told Kushner that he had cultivated close relationships with all US agencies “except three”. When Aljabri saw the transcript, he took the three agencies to mean the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency – institutions that had long favoured Nayef. To him and his patron, it was clear that MBS was trying to consolidate American support for his succession. In May 2017, Nayef attempted to make his own inroads into the Trump White House. He hired the Sonoran Policy Group, a lobbying firm in Washington with close ties to Trump’s team. Sonoran – which has since been renamed Stryk Global Diplomacy after its chairman, the lobbyist Robert Stryk – was hired to provide Nayef’s interior ministry “broad advisory services” in Washington. Nayef, people close to him said, understood that his past record did not count for much with a brash, unconventional president who would go on to have a strained relationship with the US intelligence community. Nayef wanted to impress on the new president that he was not just a longstanding partner, but a more valuable one than his cousin. Aljabri was directly involved in negotiating the $5.4m lobbying contract on behalf of the ministry. As news of the contract spread, Aljabri feared being caught between the warring princes. In May 2017, he quietly slipped away to Turkey, just days before Trump was due to visit Riyadh. Aljabri’s fears were well founded. Soon after he left, Aljabri said he got word that the main signatory of the contract – a secret service officer under Nayef – was detained by MBS loyalists and interrogated about the lobbying effort. On 4 June 2017, Aljabri texted Abdulaziz Howairini, a veteran security official, to ask whether he should continue “fasting in the cold”, a coded reference to remaining in Turkey. Howairini, who now reports to MBS, replied that he should. On 17 June, Howairini sent another text to Aljabri, warning him that the MBS loyalists were “very eager” to detain him as well. Meanwhile, furious pushback from MBS compelled Nayef to cancel the Stryk contract. According to Aljabri, Nayef warned him that MBS had seen the contract as a plot to torpedo his relationship with the Trump family and was out for blood. On 18 June, Aljabri received an abrupt text from MBS, asking him to return to Saudi Arabia to help resolve unspecified “conflicts” with Nayef. “I don’t think there’s anyone who understands [Nayef] better than you,” MBS wrote, his tone unusually conciliatory. There had been bad blood between MBS and Aljabri since 2015, when King Salman, apparently at the prince’s urging, fired Aljabri from his position for secretly meeting the then-CIA director John Brennan and then-British foreign secretary Philip Hammond without reporting the meetings to the monarch. However, Aljabri had continued working with Nayef informally, viewing his dismissal as one of MBS’s numerous attempts to weaken his patron. “Let us forget about the past,” MBS now insisted. “Are we children today? Forgive me and exonerate me before God. When are you coming back?” Aljabri replied that he needed to be away for medical treatment. Two days later, MBS launched the coup. * * * In the months after the coup, Aljabri continued to hunker down in Turkey. His immediate family was with him, except for two of his children who, on the day of the coup, had been prevented from boarding a flight in Riyadh. He secretly kept in contact with Nayef, whose movements were constrained. Meanwhile, MBS moved swiftly to tighten his grip on the security services, including the interior ministry, which was stripped of Nayef loyalists and key functions such as counter-terrorism. MBS came down heavily on any hint of public dissent. In his first major clampdown after the coup, influential clerics and intellectuals with huge social media followings were arrested in September 2017. That same month, Aljabri pleaded with MBS to allow his children to leave Saudi Arabia. But MBS insisted that Aljabri first return to discuss a “very sensitive file” related to Nayef. “Doctor, where should we dispatch the airplane to fetch you?” asked MBS in a text message. Aljabri had no intention of returning, but also sought to convince MBS that he posed no threat. In messages filled with obsequious platitudes, Aljabri pledged loyalty to MBS. “I possess lots of sensitive state information, but despite that I have never leaked anything to anyone,” Aljabri wrote. Rattling off examples of his loyalty, he wrote that he had publicly refuted the claims of “Mujtahid” – an anonymous royal whistleblower on Twitter who has long been a thorn in the side of the Saudi royal family. “What destiny awaits me were I to return [to Saudi]? Isn’t it better for me to remain outside the kingdom, where I remain faithful to your rule, refuse to say anything that would be harmful … and cooperate with Your Highness in everything that serves a common good?” MBS was unmoved. He texted Aljabri that he would pursue him “using all available means”. The threat prompted Aljabri to flee from Turkey to Canada later that month. In late 2017, Saudi Arabia tried to have Aljabri arrested through Interpol, alleging that he had stolen state funds worth billions, and pressed Canada to hand him over. Both efforts failed. Then, in October 2018, according to Aljabri, he received a warning from spies in a Middle Eastern country, who told him that he was an assassination target and urged him to stay away from Saudi embassies and consulates. (Aljabri requested the country’s name be withheld for fear of Saudi retribution.) That same month, Canadian border agents are thought to have intercepted and deported members of the Tiger Squad, a team of Saudi-sponsored hitmen, as they tried to enter the country on tourist visas. Riyadh denied any involvement but the alleged plot, implicitly acknowledged by Canadian authorities, bore chilling similarities to the way the Tiger Squad murdered the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the same month inside a Saudi diplomatic mission in Turkey. To the Americans who had worked with Aljabri, it was obvious that MBS saw him as a threat. Aljabri fleeing the kingdom was “like J Edgar Hoover’s deputy leaving DC and showing up in Moscow”, said the former US official who had worked with him. “Here’s a man liked by deep state organisations around the planet. He knows every foible, every misstep that Saudi royals have made.” * * * On a crisp winter morning last year, I was invited to a five-star hotel in Washington DC to meet Aljabri. He had travelled from Toronto to visit his son Khalid, a cardiologist and an informal spokesman for his reclusive father. When I arrived in the hotel lobby, my phone jangled with an unexpected message: “Let’s meet outside of the hotel.” Minutes later, a man appeared and whisked me to another high-rise in the area. Parked outside the residential tower, home to some of DC’s political elite, was an SUV marked “US Secret Service”. In an enclosed patio on the rooftop was Aljabri, dressed in a dark suit and wire-rimmed glasses. He was sitting on a couch, gazing at the view of downtown Washington. A wall-mounted fireplace radiated warmth and in the background, the faint warble of a grand piano could be heard. As I arrived, Aljabri stood up, Starbucks coffee in hand, and began by pointing out the landmarks: the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the White House. During the Trump presidency, Aljabri had avoided Washington DC, he said. He has plenty of influential friends here, including senators on both sides of the aisle and security officials. Even so, he was wary of the long arm of the Saudi state, and Trump’s warm relationship with MBS had made him even more wary. As we spoke, Aljabri, who holds a doctorate in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, mused about how different his life’s trajectory might have been had he not met Nayef. Aljabri began his career at the interior ministry in the 1990s. He once tried quitting for a job at Aramco, the state oil giant that is the biggest cash cow for the kingdom. Nayef stopped him. Now their destinies seem braided together. Since the coup, about 40 of Aljabri’s family members and close associates have been detained in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to coerce him into returning. His voice cracked as he pulled up photos on his phone of his incarcerated children, Sarah and Omar, now 22 and 24 respectively. They were arrested in March 2020, and convicted, in a closed trial, of money laundering and attempting to escape Saudi Arabia unlawfully. Aljabri’s son-in-law is also in detention. Aljabri said that if there were ever a chance for an exchange on a bridge – MBS on one end with his family, Aljabri on the other – he would do the trade in a heartbeat. “Take your ransom, release the hostages,” he said, imagining the scene. But he knows that is wishful thinking. In August 2020, after his children were jailed, Aljabri filed an explosive lawsuit in Washington, going public with his claim that MBS sent a death squad after him. (The judge would later remark that the lawsuit read like “the stuff of a Tom Clancy novel”.) Aljabri knows he cannot win against a powerful dictator, but the action could at the very least be what one of his associates described as a “pebble in MBS’s shoe”. In early 2021, the lawsuit triggered what Aljabri saw as retaliatory lawsuits in Boston and Ontario, filed by 10 Saudi state-linked firms initially established by Nayef to provide cover for US-Saudi operations and now controlled by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, of which MBS is the chairman. These companies accused Aljabri and his associates of defrauding them of $3.5bn. Aljabri denied any wrongdoing and said defending himself would require revealing the operations and finances of the companies, which were murky by design to support covert activities. Court documents filed in Boston by the US Justice Department suggest US officials were keen for an out-of-court settlement between Aljabri and MBS, apparently to prevent any public revelations about undercover American operations. But those efforts went nowhere. One US official, previously posted in the American mission in Riyadh, told me that the Saudis were not interested in settling because they are “not convinced Aljabri will remain silent”. In February this year, Aljabri made a new offer to MBS. In a letter to a senior royal court adviser, Aljabri offered a “financial and legal resolution”. (Aljabri’s team refused to discuss the specifics of the offer with me.) They sent the White House a memo requesting US officials to “urge the Saudi leadership to accept the restitution offer”. It was met with silence from MBS. MBS’s supporters say Aljabri’s eagerness for a financial settlement is tacit admission of his guilt. Aljabri’s team say that MBS’s unwillingness to settle proves that corruption is just a pretext to pursue a political opponent. Meanwhile, the legal battle drags on. In September, the Washington court dismissed Aljabri’s lawsuit against MBS, citing lack of personal jurisdiction. (Aljabri’s team are appealing against the decision.) Late last year, the Boston court threw out the lawsuit against Aljabri after the US government invoked the “state secrets privilege” to halt the disclosure of classified national security information. (The companies are fighting back.) But those secrets are still at risk of exposure in an Ontario court. Court filings from earlier this year show lawyers for the US government are working with their Canadian counterparts to prevent that outcome. But even if the lawsuits against Aljabri proceed, it could prove tricky to prove the corruption allegations conclusively. That’s because a key witness, the man who oversaw counter-terrorism spending, has disappeared: Nayef. * * * In late 2017, the conditions of Nayef’s house arrest were relaxed, but he was still barred from travelling outside the kingdom. Aljabri told me that Nayef had initially believed the worst that would happen to him was losing his official titles and receiving a handsome financial compensation in return. He expected to be treated the same way as his predecessor Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former head of intelligence who was dismissed as crown prince in 2015. After King Salman fired him, according to a well-placed source, Prince Muqrin was lavished with farewell gifts, including a royal payout of about $800m, and the luxury yacht Solandge. By contrast, a large chunk of Nayef’s wealth was seized. On 10 December 2017, Nayef sent a letter to HSBC in Geneva asking that his “EUR, GBP, and USD balances” be transferred to a Saudi bank account. A source with knowledge of Nayef’s assets said his bankers and lawyers in Geneva ignored such requests, suspecting that the prince was acting under duress. (HSBC declined to comment when asked how it responded to the letter. The bank requested withholding the name of the official addressed in the letter, citing safety concerns.) The total value of Nayef’s overseas holdings is unclear. The prince’s associates say he owns prime real estate worth billions in Europe and the US. Nonetheless, what is certain is that Nayef had to surrender a substantial part of his domestic assets. The source with knowledge of these, who is based in Europe, provided a table with a breakdown of his “confiscated” companies and bank accounts – the total amount was $5.22bn. A separate source close to the prince shared what appeared to be a slightly less up-to-date spreadsheet with a similar breakdown. The “total value” confiscated, it said, was 17.8bn riyals, or $4.75bn. In 2018 and 2019, Nayef enjoyed relative freedom, even though he wasn’t allowed to leave the kingdom. His favourite activity, falconry in Algeria’s deserts, was out of the question, but he was allowed to go hunting inside Saudi Arabia. He showed up at royal weddings and funerals. One video that surfaced in late 2019 showed a group of supporters taking selfies with the prince and kissing his hand. Then, in March 2020, suddenly things got decidedly worse for Nayef. The government raided his desert retreat on the outskirts of Riyadh, and he was taken into detention. Several staff were also detained, the Europe-based source said. Nayef was kept in solitary confinement for more than six months. During that time, “he was seriously mistreated”, the source said. He alleged that Nayef was strung up his ankles and tortured. “As a consequence, he now has long-lasting damage to his lower legs and ankles, making walking painful. He lost a significant amount of weight.” Towards the end of 2020, according to the Europe-based source, Nayef was moved to a compound in the Yamamah palace complex in Riyadh, the king’s official residence and main seat of the Saudi government. He is not allowed outside his small unit and he is filmed and recorded at all times, the source said. He is not allowed visitors, except certain family members on rare occasions, nor can he see his personal doctor or legal representatives. He has been made to sign documents without reading them. In the spring of 2021, Nayef’s bankers and lawyers in Europe received new wealth transfer requests. They included a phone call from Nayef to his lawyer in Switzerland, according to a source privy to the discussion. The lawyer, to whom Nayef had previously granted power of attorney, refused, as he believed his client was under duress. The prince invited the lawyer to visit Saudi Arabia and verify for himself. Nayef “kept saying ‘I’m free, we’ll go out for dinner when you come to Riyadh’”, the source said. The lawyer insisted that Nayef needed to travel to Switzerland with his family to authorise the transfer in person. When reached by telephone, the lawyer told me that he could neither deny nor confirm the conversation, expressing concern about the potential repercussions of media engagement for his client. “The main reason that Nayef is being held is that the crown prince wrongly believes that he is a threat to the succession,” the Europe-based source said. “In also going after his money, MBS is attempting to humiliate Nayef so there is absolutely no threat of anyone seeing the former crown prince as a viable alternative.” * * * In a marble-bedecked luxury hotel in the heart of Riyadh, I met one of MBS’s most prominent spin doctors. Sitting next to him in the cafe was a senior royal court official, who stayed for part of the meeting. From our previous encounters, it was clear the spin doctor was part of a state-sponsored campaign to project MBS in the west as a visionary, boldly pushing through social reforms. He had wanted to talk about how the prince had lifted decades-old bans on women drivers and cinemas, allowed once-forbidden music concerts and curbed the power of the religious police who staunchly opposed mixing of the sexes. “MBS has balls,” he once told me. This time, an evening in March 2020, the spin doctor, hunched over a cup of coffee and a plate of crepes slathered with Nutella, wanted to set the record straight on Nayef’s recent disappearance. The Saudi government had offered no comment on why Nayef had been detained, along with another senior royal seen as a rival to MBS, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz. This meeting was the closest I would get to an official explanation. The spin doctor sought to dismiss a narrative playing out in the foreign media that the princes had been detained because the authorities believed they were plotting to unseat MBS and his father. MBS, he said, remained “in control” and the detentions were carried out “after an accumulation of negative behaviour by the two princes”. The sudden purge was meant to enforce “discipline” within the royal family. He did not elaborate on the nature of the “negative behaviour”, but said that the princes could be released soon. Nearly three years later, the princes are still in detention. “Both the Biden and the Trump administrations called for release of Mohammed bin Nayef … at the top of their talking points when engaging privately with Saudi leadership,” Kirsten Fontenrose, who briefly oversaw Gulf policy for the Trump administration, told the US House foreign affairs committee last year. “Mohammed bin Salman has been unmoved.” There are now no visible rivals left to the throne. MBS’s power appears absolute. On his current trajectory, there is nothing to stop him from succeeding his father as king. The global outcry over Khashoggi’s murder, the ruinous Saudi-led war in Yemen and growing repression at home – nothing seems to have shaken his hold on the country. Despite the reputational risks of doing business with a dictator, Wall Street executives are eager to strike deals with the rich petro-state. Activists fear a recent US decision to grant him sovereign immunity in a case concerning Khashoggi’s murder could further embolden him to go after critics. A royal family source, who privately denounced Nayef’s treatment but has remained silent in public to avoid retribution, told me that he would not be surprised if Nayef were to suddenly make an appearance in public someday alongside MBS, giving his blessing to the man who crushed him. Similar to the staged video after the 2017 coup, that would be another defining image of the age of MBS – and his violent rise to power. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T22:00:09Z","webTitle":"Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip review – behold, TV’s glorious new power throuple!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","fields":{"bodyText":"It is an odd throuple, as Ruby Wax admits early on in her new three-part travel series, Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip (BBC One). “You might be thinking, what am I doing in the middle of the wild west with a Spice Girl and an actress?” she asks; presumably Wax, Melanie Brown and Emily Atack aren’t usual holiday mates. The answer is, of course, to pay tribute to a near-forgotten 19th-century female explorer named Isabella Bird, who made her way, on her own, across the Rocky Mountains in 1873. Bird is a personal hero of Wax’s, although why Brown and Atack are here is glossed over. They are trailblazers, too? That’ll do. It doesn’t really matter, because together they make for entertaining company. Wax reminded viewers of her calibre as a TV host with last year’s When Ruby Met ... retrospective, and she does have an uncanny ability to harness chaos at the same time as cause it. This makes her very watchable. Atack says she needs to get off Instagram and see the world, while Brown is there seemingly to keep an eye on Wax’s driving skills. If anyone remembers Maureen from Driving School, the comparison is not unfounded. They bicker like an old married couple (“Piss off, Ruby!”) and there is a familial dynamic here. It’s not unexpected when Atack calls one of them “mum”. The plan is that the women will take the same path Bird did, before veering off into other bits of Colorado to do a travelogue tinged with adventure, self-discovery and even self-care. I say self-care tentatively, because I know it has Gwyneth Paltrow connotations, and this isn’t as woo-woo or self-indulgent as that. But Bird was 41 and in ill health when she left Britain for an adventure in the hope that it would cure her maladies. Her health was much restored by her travels and she became famous in Colorado as “the Englishwoman who rode as well as a man”. This programme doesn’t make a song and dance of it, but Wax, 69, Brown, 47 and Atack, 32, have a number of conversations that suggest they are trying to make sense of how women should and could live today. This is intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that they come at it from different generations. Atack worries that her eggs are “dying”; Wax wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn’t felt the obligation to have children. The other is that they are entering into a traditionally macho, male world, although they do meet a number of female ranchers, who now make up one-third of all ranchers in the region. They wrangle cattle, climb mountains, visit bars and eat prairie oysters – which are emphatically not from the sea. More accurately, Atack eats them, and doesn’t much recoil when she’s told what they are. “The bollocks of an oyster?” she replies, which can be added to Jessica Simpson’s buffalo wings in TV’s history of unlikely cuts of meat. There’s a stagey scene in which the trio enter a small-town shop/bar, and the locals stop and stare, though I suspect the presence of a camera crew might have gone some way to grabbing their attention. Once they stop making Deliverance jokes, it gets much better. There are two standout sections, both of which involve less of the celebrity stuff, and more of them getting the stories of ordinary people. The first is Linda, who used her downtime during the pandemic to write a romantic fan-fiction style novel about Bird and her rumoured amour Mountain Jim, a “one-eyed desperado”. She seems delighted by how fantastically racy her own work is, as Wax reads selected parts, then goes on to describe the mountains as “like the kiss of a lover”. I want her to join the Trailblazers for the rest of their trip. The other highlight sees them spending time with Tim, a self-declared “mountain man”, who lives in a remote cabin only accessible by snowmobile for six months of the year. He talks about running it on solar power and spring water, the bears that have appeared on his porch, and taking from the land only what you need to survive. His personal history is moving and Wax teases it out of him beautifully. Then she hides in his wardrobe while Mel B breaks his desk. Atack, somehow ending up in a Saffy-from-Ab-Fab role, is dutifully collecting firewood and kindling outdoors. The mix of chaos and calm is entertaining and soothing. They gather round the fire and peace settles upon them. Judging by the teaser for next week, it doesn’t last long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T01:23:34Z","webTitle":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","fields":{"bodyText":"An enthusiastic Rishi Sunak has told ministers to expect a positive outcome next week when he travels to San Diego to unveil a deal to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the Aukus pact with the US. Multiple sources said they believed the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia, a deal that will safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness. A senior minister said Sunak had told colleagues he was delighted by the outcome of the negotiations, which have been going on for 18 months and have presented Australia with a choice between a British or a US design, based on the existing Astute or Virginia class submarines. “The deal has definitely gone our way. The prime minister was buzzing about it when he told ministers, smiling and bouncing on the balls of his feet,” the minister said. A second source outside government with knowledge of the talks said they had also been told to expect a British design success when the deal is announced on Monday, although any final submarine will also make heavy use of US technology. Sunak is due to travel to the west coast for a trilateral summit with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, on Monday, where he also expected to unveil a refresh of Britain’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy in the light of the war in Ukraine. Supplying Australia with a nuclear-powered submarine was the centrepiece for the Aukus defence pact, announced in September 2021, with the US and UK agreeing to share secret reactor technology in a surprise deal, so Canberra could dump an alternative diesel-powered design from France. The expectation, one source indicated, was that Australia would work jointly on a design for a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design, although it may not be seaworthy until the 2040s because of the complexity of the work. Further reports last night suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US as part of the three-way deal. Meanwhile, an alternative plan that the UK could even be willing to sell or lease the two Astute class submarines yet to be completed at Barrow, HMS Agincourt and HMS Agamemnon, is wide of the mark. Naval analysts say the UK’s submarine fleet is already stretched and could not afford a sudden reduction. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor, propulsion technology that will put the country’s diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut” according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. The new submarines will not carry nuclear weapons. But James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was not yet clear how the nuclear waste generated by the propulsion reactors will be dealt with – and whether that will happen in Australia or the UK or US. Defence experts said the time it would take to build the new submarines meant that there may be some related short-term developments. The US is keen to be able to base its nuclear submarines in Australia, making it easier to patrol the South Pacific, as it seeks to retain naval parity with China. A UK government spokesperson said: “When we announced the Aukus partnership in September 2021 we said there would be an 18-month scoping period to determine the optimal path to procuring Australia nuclear-powered submarines. The outcome of the scoping period is due to be announced soon.” A No 10 spokesperson said they could not pre-empt any future announcements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T00:50:11Z","webTitle":"Albanese budget scraps ‘risky’ Coalition plan to underwrite new power generation ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government has scrapped the Coalition’s electricity underwriting scheme. Critics had warned it could cost billions to prop up fossil fuels and would push up power prices. On Monday, the industry minister, Ed Husic, repealed the instrument that enabled federal funding for energy generation projects, a pet scheme of the former Liberal energy minister Angus Taylor. The program was widely panned for delays in implementation, exposing taxpayers to billions of dollars worth of liabilities by guaranteeing a minimum price for dispatchable power, and competing with new-generation investments including the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup Taylor and the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the electricity underwriting scheme in December 2018, prompting criticism from the Australian Industry Group for its “inadequate approach to integrating emissions and energy policy”. In March 2019, the Morrison government announced a shortlist of 12 projects including six pumped hydro plants, five gas generators and an upgrade to the Vales Point coal-fired power plant proposed by coal baron and LNP donor Trevor St Baker. But three years later, industry and energy department officials conceded no projects had been funded through the scheme. The explanatory memorandum for the repeal confirms that “no projects have been delivered and no underwriting commitments have been made”. “The [underwriting] program has now been closed because it was unlikely to achieve its objectives,” it said. In March 2022 Labor and the Greens voted in the Senate to disallow the program’s funding, but were blocked by the Coalition and One Nation. Labor’s Louise Pratt said the program “lacks both transparency and integrity”. “It has given disgraced minister Angus Taylor a blank cheque to fund pet projects without due process,” Pratt told the Senate. “Industry and experts tell us that it will push up power prices and expose taxpayers to risky investments.” Pratt noted the Business Council of Australia had warned that “ad hoc intervention in the energy market, such as underwriting generation investment … will only result in less investment in energy generation, less reliable energy and ultimately higher prices”. “We support the role that gas will play in a transition in energy but support for any projects – gas or pumped hydro – needs to be considered through a proper process, not through a Coalition slush fund such as this one.” The Australian National Audit Office is considering an audit of the electricity underwriting program after a referral from independent MP Zali Steggall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T13:30:39Z","webTitle":"Utes fan arrested after threatening to blow up nuclear reactor if team lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","fields":{"bodyText":"A University of Utah student has been arrested after threatening to detonate a nuclear reactor on campus if the school’s football team lost to San Diego State.

The attacks in the Pacific north-west are similar to the assault on North Carolina power stations that cut electricity to 40,000 people. As first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting and KUOW Public Radio, there have been at least six attacks, some of which involved firearms and caused residents to lose power. Two of the attacks shared similarities with the incident in Moore county, North Carolina, where two stations were hit by gunfire. Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the North Carolina attack. The four Pacific north-west utilities whose equipment was attacked have said they are cooperating with the FBI. The agency has not yet confirmed if it is investigating the incidents. It’s unknown who is behind the attacks but experts have long warned of discussion among extremists of disrupting the nation’s power grid. Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) said in a statement on Thursday that it was seeking tips about “trespassing, vandalism and malicious damage of equipment” at a substation in Clackamas county on 24 November that caused damage and required cleanup costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. “Someone clearly wanted to damage equipment and, possibly, cause a power outage,” said John Lahti, the utility’s transmission vice-president of field services. “We were fortunate to avoid any power supply disruption, which would have jeopardized public safety, increased financial damages and presented challenges to the community on a holiday.” Any attack on electric infrastructure “potentially puts the safety of the public and our workers at risk”, said BPA, which delivers hydropower across the Pacific north-west . Portland General Electric, a public utility that provides electricity to nearly half of the state’s population, said it had begun repairs after suffering “a deliberate physical attack on one of our substations” that also occurred in the Clackamas area in late November 2022. It said it was “actively cooperating” with the FBI. Puget Sound Energy, an energy utility in Washington, reported two cases of vandalism at two substations in late November to the FBI and peer utilities, but said the incidents appeared to be unrelated to other recent attacks. “There is no indication that these vandalism attempts indicate a greater risk to our operations and we have extensive measures to monitor, protect and minimize the risk to our equipment and infrastructure,” the company said in a statement. Experts and intelligence analysts have long warned of both the vulnerability of the US power grid and talk among extremists about attacking the crucial infrastructure. “It’s very vulnerable,” said Keith Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who has worked with energy utilities. “[These attacks] are a real threat.” The physical risks to the power grid have been known for decades, Granger Morgan, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told CBS. “We’ve made a bit of progress, but the system is still quite vulnerable,” he said. A US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report released in January warned that domestic extremists have been developing “credible, specific plans” to attack electricity infrastructure since at least 2020. The DHS has cited a document shared on a Telegram channel used by extremists that included a white supremacist guide to attacking an electric grid with firearms, CNN reported. “These fringe groups have been talking about this for a long time,” Taylor said. “I’m not at all surprised this happened – I’m surprised it’s taken this long.” Three men who law enforcement identified as members of the Boogaloo movement allegedly planned to attack a substation in Nevada in 2020 to distract police and attempt to incite a riot. In 2013, still unknown assailants cut fiber-optic phone lines and used a sniper to fire shots at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric substation near San Jose in what appeared to be a carefully planned attack that caused millions of dollars in damage. The attack prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) to order grid operators to increase security. “They knew what they were doing. They had a specific objective. They wanted to knock out the substation,” Jon Wellinghoff, the then chair of Ferc, told 60 Minutes, adding that the attack could have “brought down all of Silicon Valley”. After the 2013 attack in California, a Ferc analysis found that attackers could cause a blackout coast-to-coast if they took out only nine of the 55,000 substations in the US. The US electrical grid is vast and sprawling with 450,000 miles of transmission lines, 55,000 substations and 6,400 power plants. Power plants and substations are dispersed in every corner of the country, connected by transmission lines that transport electricity through farmland, forests and swamps. Attackers do not necessarily have to get close to cause significant damage. “In a centralized system, if I [want] to take out one coal-fired plant, I don’t even have to take out the plant, I just have to take out the transmission line,” said Taylor. “You can cause a ripple effect where one outage can cause an entire seaboard to go down.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T19:59:17Z","webTitle":"Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","fields":{"bodyText":"Iran has enriched uranium particles up to just short of weapons grade, placing further pressure on western powers to issue a third censure of Iran at a meeting of the nuclear watchdog board next week. In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T13:55:49Z","webTitle":"Energy makes the headlines, but reset on diplomacy is Albanese’s real power play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","fields":{"bodyText":"For weeks, all eyes have been on soaring energy prices, and what the governments of Australia will do to give households and businesses relief. Governments answered part of the national water cooler question on Friday, agreeing to new price caps for coal and gas, and to rebates for people on low and middle incomes. The impact of the proposed price caps seems clear. Power bills will increase, but they will be lower than they otherwise would be in the absence of government intervention. Consumer rebates are still a bit of a work in progress, requiring final agreement between the treasurer Jim Chalmers and his state counterparts. While energy has dominated the headlines since October, other important policy conundrums are gathering speed as we stagger towards the summer break. The Albanese government has been pushing ahead in diplomacy, security and in defence policy. This week, Labor’s Clare O’Neil reset key priorities in the national security portfolio most associated with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton – home affairs. During a speech to the National Press Club, O’Neil, the current home affairs minister made it clear she would retire the made-for-2GB-mantras of stop the boats and bad bikies. Replacing them? A sharper focus on cyber security, a new civics and social cohesion program to address misinformation and threats to democracy, and greater coordination around the natural disasters intensified by the climate crisis. While O’Neil was hosing out hoary chestnuts from home affairs, the defence minister Richard Marles and the foreign minister Penny Wong met their counterparts in the United States. This week’s “Ausmin” discussion in Washington hung a lantern over the growing US military presence in Australia. The talks this week also moved Australia closer to operationalising the Aukus nuclear submarine pact, while working through how to solve the yawning capability gap that exists in the interim. Let’s open with a Saturday morning mind bender about Aukus. Readers: do we think the Albanese government would have initiated the Aukus agreement if Anthony Albanese and Co had been in government during the last parliamentary term? I think about this sliding doors question periodically. It’s interesting to me, because I don’t know the answer. Sometimes I think it must be no. Other times, I think, given the dangerous state of the world, all roads lead all Australian governments to an Indo-Pacific nuclear submarine junction. While we are playing hypothetical, it’s important to be clear. Labor did have an opportunity to say no to Aukus back in opposition. Albanese did not have to endorse Morrison’s plan. Paul Keating counselled against it. But the political risk of resistance was high. With an election bearing down, Morrison was absolutely desperate to create a point of difference with his political opponents – so desperate that he ultimately escalated and branded Marles a “Manchurian candidate” in the parliament. This conduct was so unbecoming Canberra’s intelligence establishment emerged from the shadows and rebuked Morrison in plain sight. So we know what happened. Labor said yes to Aukus, which draws Australia ever deeper into the military complex of the US. As well as the rolling to-and-fro about Aukus, this week Australian ministers in Washington agreed to “preposition stores, munitions, and fuel in support of US capabilities in Australia” and agreed to “increase rotations of our air, land and sea forces”. The general atmospherics of the week suggest the Albanese government is journeying deeper down the US integration path with few, if any, qualms. But I’d caution readers against a one-dimensional reading of events. A reading that says the Albanese government, in a brain dead partisan risk aversion trance, is all the way with Uncle Sam, does miss an important nuance. Australia is absolutely saddling up with the US – a choice that was made long before we entered the current era of Chinese militarism and nationalism. Australia made this choice years before we could see the possibility of a military conflagration over Taiwan. But that doesn’t mean Australia isn’t hedging our bets. If we look past the razzle dazzle of Ausmin and Aukus to the looming defence strategic review, the important nuance comes into focus. This arms-length review, established by Albanese and Marles, and reporting early next year, is an exercise in establishing whether or not Australia can defend itself in light of current threats. The process is examining defence force structure, posture and preparedness. It will consider what sort of investments Australia should make if we want to be able to defend the country against sudden lethal aggression. At one level, the policy question the review asks is entirely routine. All responsible governments make provision to defend their territory against hostile incursions. Governments also adjust those plans in the light of evolving threats, and expert assessments of the capability of adversaries. But given Australia sits under the military umbrella of the US, and given the government seems to be walking even further down that road, why is the same government asking a pointed policy question that goes right to the heart of our national sovereignty? Here’s a theory. Perhaps the government is asking that question because we can no longer fully rely on the US to be a reliable security partner. Now don’t get me wrong. Joe Biden has certainly revived the US as a responsible global citizen that respects the value of alliances. But how long is Biden there? How long before the reactionaries break back? The resurgence of populist isolationism in the US casts a long shadow across world. If I were Albanese, I’d want insurance against the whims of Donald Trump 2.0, or Ron DeSantis – or whomever. In an interesting interview with the Australian back in November, Albanese was direct about his intentions. He said Australia needed missiles, and drones, and enhanced cyber capabilities. He flagged increasing Australian military capability within five years. He said he wanted the strategic review to provide advice about the optimal means of self defence. More than this, Albanese said Australia needed to “project force” – quite the declaration from a life-long leftwinger from inner-city Sydney. The moral of the story this weekend is things are generally more complicated than they look. Australia is going further into the US military complex, while hedging our bets. And if we look to defence’s policy companion, diplomacy, we see mirrored complexity. Over the past six months, the Albanese government has managed to stabilise the relationship with Beijing. This has happened because China has chosen to resume open diplomacy, and because Labor has sought to lower the temperature in the theatre of domestic politics. This relational reset with China has happened at the same time as the government has made our increasing integration with the US more explicit. It’s also coincided with a Wong-led soft-power offensive in the Pacific which is all about repelling Chinese influence. Australia has turbo-charged diplomacy while simultaneously signalling our inclination to strengthen deterrence. These two objectives are superficially contradictory, but as Marles put it in a speech earlier this year: “The idea that Australia has to choose between diplomacy and defence – or, as some critics would have it, between cooperation and confrontation – is a furphy, and a dangerous one at that”. So where does all this leave us? The simple answer is in a quantifiably different place to the past three years, where foreign and defence policy was very often crafted as a kabuki play for a domestic audience. When a government’s international statecraft is tuned for the TV news and talkback radio, to amplify intra-day partisan messaging, things are simple. There are goodies and baddies, and heroes and villains; rinse and repeat. The change of government has reset the terrain. We are now back to Australia prosecuting foreign and defence policy for its own ends, in a dangerous world. The cross-currents will be strong enough at times to feel a bit scary, and a bit confusing. But it’s all pretty interesting. I recommend we all fasten our seat belts, secure our tray tables, and watch how our fate in the region is reshaped over the next 12 months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/putin-announces-partial-mobilisation-in-russia-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T16:24:22Z","webTitle":"Putin announces partial mobilisation and threatens nuclear retaliation in escalation of Ukraine war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/putin-announces-partial-mobilisation-in-russia-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/putin-announces-partial-mobilisation-in-russia-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing. The president also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying that Russia had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he called western threats on Russian territory and added that he was not bluffing. In a highly anticipated televised address, Putin said that Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which “wants to destroy our country”, and claimed the west had tried to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defence ministry, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that will apply to “those with previous military experience”. “These are not people who’ve never seen or heard anything about the army,” he said, adding that students can “keep going to class”. According to the decree signed by Putin on Wednesday, the contracts of soldiers fighting in Ukraine will also be extended until the end of the partial mobilisation period. The Russian leader’s televised address to the nation comes a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold “referendums” this weekend on becoming part of Russia. The Kremlin’s plans to annex four regions are likely to further escalate the war following Ukrainian recent successes on the battlefield. “To those who allow themselves such statements regarding Russia, I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of Nato countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,” Putin said. He added: “It’s not a bluff.” The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Putin’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation was a “predictable step” that highlights that the war was not going according to the Kremlin’s plan. Putin’s speech was also swiftly condemned by western leaders on Wednesday. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Putin’s actions were “an admission that his invasion is failing” and “Russia is becoming a global pariah”. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, said Russia’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation was “another bad and wrong step from Russia”. Shortly after Putin’s speech, Russian opposition groups called for nationwide antiwar street protests against the mobilisation law while the country’s opposition leader, Alexei Navalny slammed Putin for sending more Russians to their deaths for a failing war. “It is clear that the criminal war is getting worse, deepening, and Putin is trying to involve as many people as possible in this,” Navalny said in a video message from jail recorded and published by his lawyers. “He wants to smear hundreds of thousands of people in this blood.” By Wednesday evening, more than 650 people had been arrested at protests against mobilisation across the country, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info. Putin’s national address was planned initially for Tuesday evening, hours after the four Ukrainian regions announced “referendums” on joining Russia. However, the speech was postponed without explanation, causing a flurry of speculation. Some observers proposed that the Kremlin had changed its mind on its decision to announce a mobilisation, while others pointed to Putin’s habit of keeping his audience waiting. Those close to the Kremlin, however, said the decision to postpone the speech indicated Putin was planning a major escalation. “The longer the announced appearance of President Putin is delayed, the more serious the announcements in it will be,” the pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei Markov wrote on his Telegram late on Tuesday. Putin in his speech also said he would support the votes scheduled for this weekend to join Russia in the parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under its control. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, slammed Russian plans to stage referendums in the occupied regions as a “noise” and thanked Ukraine’s allies for denouncing the votes. In his nightly address, Zelenskiy said Russia’s plans to hold referendums would not change Ukraine’s plans to retake areas occupied by Russian forces. “The situation on the frontline clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,” he said. “Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this.” The Kremlin is likely to closely orchestrate the upcoming votes in the parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions that are currently under its control which are but certain to go Moscow’s way. Western leaders quickly slammed the votes as illegitimate and have vouched to continue their military support of Ukraine. “I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today’s mass principled firm condemnation of Russia’s attempts to stage new sham referenda,” Zelenskiy said. The partial mobilisation announced by Putin will widely be seen as a major admission of the Kremlin’s military failures in Ukraine. Shoigu in his speech admitted that conditions in Ukraine were “difficult”, saying Russia was at war with “the collective west”. Shoigu on Wednesday also gave the first official estimate of Russia’s battlefield losses since late March, announcing that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine since the start of the fighting. Western intelligence as well as independent media reports suggest the real figure is significantly higher, with up to 80,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-30T07:30:42Z","webTitle":"Escape from Model Land by Erica Thompson review – the power and pitfalls of prediction ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","fields":{"bodyText":"“The only function of economic forecasting,” wrote the great American economist John Kenneth Galbraith, “is to make astrology look respectable.” It is characteristic of Erica Thompson’s sprightly and highly original new book on the uses and abuses of mathematical modelling that she dares to turn Galbraith’s verdict on its head. The medieval practice of casting horoscopes, she shows in one typically engaging section that embodies her most important themes, has a surprising amount to teach us about the modern practice of using models to guide policy. The topic is an exceptionally important and timely one. The Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and turbulence in financial markets are just three examples of how fundamental mathematical modelling has become to decision-making in many areas of modern life. Thompson’s argument is not, of course, that scientific forecasting has made no progress over the past half-millennium. Today’s researchers benefit from a world awash with data on natural phenomena and human behaviour, making the raw material for model-building vastly richer than it once was. Mathematical and statistical techniques are far more sophisticated – and we have modern computing power to help us crunch the numbers. These differences make the artificial worlds which modern economists, meteorologists and epidemiologists build dramatically more hi-res than anything the benighted court astrologer could come up with. But just like their medieval counterparts, today’s “Model Lands” – the hypothetical worlds we construct in order to explore the future – have no practical value until their analyses and predictions are applied in real life. It is in this all-important step – the escape of Thompson’s title – that the parallels between astrology and mathematical modelling become particularly relevant. The central common challenge is working out how much of what we learn in pristine but artificial models remains valid in messy but concrete real life. One way of figuring this out is quantitative: you compare the predictions of the model against new, incoming data. A critical obstacle here is that predictions based on modern mathematical models, no less than those based on medieval horoscopes, usually depend on an extensive hinterland of assumptions. That makes testing the validity of their forecasts intrinsically difficult: were the assumptions wrong, or was it just that not enough assumptions were included? Another problem is that the fresh, real-world data needed to test the results is often not even available. It will flood in quickly and easily for day-ahead weather forecasts, for example – but might arrive centuries too late to discriminate between today’s long-term climate models. That’s why, Thompson explains, a second, qualitative way of determining the success of predictions is much more common: reliance on expert judgment. The pitfalls of this route were also well known to the medieval courts. Only those versed in the most cutting-edge mathematical knowledge were skilled enough to interpret medieval horoscopes. As such, it was in practice impossible for the client to come to their own conclusions. The result was that an exclusive guild, whose true competence remained unknown, ended up marking their own homework. The same could be said today. Another hazard stalking ancient and modern modellers alike is that they fall in love with the sheer beauty and complexity of their own constructions. Having eaten the lotuses of Model Land, they can’t bring themselves to escape. Scenarios and predictions are simply accepted as if the model actually is real life. “Such naive Model Land realism,” Thompson warns, “can have catastrophic effects because it invariably results in an underestimation of uncertainties and exposure to greater-than-expected risk.” Anyone who remembers Goldman Sachs’s chief financial officer blaming the global credit crunch of 2007 on the occurrence of “twenty-five standard deviation events, several days in a row” knows what Thompson is getting at. If it couldn’t happen in the model, it just wasn’t meant to happen in real life. It’s not all bad news. Thompson is a data scientist and mathematical modeller herself, and her book is far from an exercise in model-bashing. It is instead a nuanced and constructive critique of what remains an invaluable analytical method – just not necessarily for the reasons you might expect. For example, even though the astrologers’ models of natural forces and human behaviour were wrong, the practice of casting horoscopes could still be a useful aid to policymaking. They brought systematic thinkers into the orbit of otherwise impulsive rulers; it allowed the discussion of important, otherwise taboo subjects in the safe context of interpreting the stars; and it could give decision-makers the public narrative they needed in order to act. The same applies today. As Thompson shows, mathematical model-building can still be a constructive tool, even if the models themselves are flawed. As Dwight D Eisenhower said: “Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable”. • Felix Martin is the author of Money: the Unauthorised Biography (Vintage) Escape from Model Land by Erica Thompson is published by John Murray (£14.99).

Biden vowed that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. All members of the Bucharest Nine (B9) have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. President Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said he urged Joe Biden to seek Nato deployment of additional military equipment, including Himars artillery or attack helicopters, in the Baltic states, during the US president’s meeting with B9 leaders. He said Biden was silent but took notes as he listened to Nausėda and others on deploying air defence systems in the Baltics and other eastern flank countries. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship just days before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. Wang told Vladimir Putin that Beijing will play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months, although an exact date has not been announced. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Vladimir Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. Biden has said Putin “made a mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland” in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to attend a concert marking the “Defenders of the Fatherland” Day. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will meet UN secretary general, António Guterres, to discuss ongoing support for Ukraine as the UN’s security council meets this week, the US state department has said. Blinken is expected to travel to New York tomorrow to attend the security council meeting on Ukraine, marking one year of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has urged the UN to establish a special tribunal to try Russia for crimes of aggression to ensure Moscow’s invasion “never will be repeated” anywhere. Ukraine’s victory “would mean the victory of human rights over lawlessness, torture and destruction”, Zelenska said in a video address to a special meeting at the UN on human rights violations in Ukraine. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit was an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. A group of 10 EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a leading humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing from bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks occurring in the home and in communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. On Tuesday, Japan’s finance minister said financial leaders of the G7 nations would meet tomorrow, on the sidelines of the G20 gathering in India, to discuss measures against Russia. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. It comes after Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia has been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Thanks for following along, we’ll be back tomorrow. Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. Wallace earlier spoke with Ukrainian soldiers who were training to use the UK’s Challenger tanks, which he said would arrive in Ukraine in “the spring”. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons. Asked whether the UK had the commercial capacity to continue to provide Ukraine with weapons such as artillery shells, he said: We have laid contracts ... We’ve started to already now receive some deliveries of that for our own restocking and also some of it to Ukraine. He said shells could be made fairly quickly but “the key is to make sure that we place the orders, and we’ve started placing those orders over the last 10 months and that starts to sort of warm up those production lines”. He added: Absolutely part of the effort this year is sustainability - how can we, the international community, stimulate supply chains, how can we stimulate our own supply chains for our own equipment and that’s been one of the changes Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has urged the UN to establish a special tribunal to try Russia for crimes of aggression to ensure Moscow’s invasion “never will be repeated” anywhere. Ukraine’s victory “would mean the victory of human rights over lawlessness, torture and destruction”, Zelenska said in a video address to a special meeting at the UN on human rights violations in Ukraine. She said: Regardless of our country or nationality, we have the right not to be killed in our own homes. However, Ukrainians are being killed in front of the whole world for already a year now. Ukrainians are being killed in their own cities, villages, apartments, hospitals, theatres. She added: In any city of Ukraine, in London, Berlin or New York we have the right to live free, not to be killed or tortured. The right not to be blown to pieces by a Russian missile. Each of us has this right. CBS News’ Pamela Falk has a clip of Zelenska’s speech to the UN meeting: Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers meeting in India tomorrow will discuss financial support to Ukraine, according to German finance ministry sources. Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, will also join the talks, chaired by Japan, in the Indian city of Bangalore on Thursday. International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva is expected to give an update on a planned aid programme for Ukraine at the meeting, Reuters is citing sources as saying. The IMF aims to adopt the new aid programme for Ukraine by the end of March, they said. The G7 meeting will be followed later in the week by a gathering of G20 financial leaders from the world’s major economies, to be hosted in Bangalore by India, which has the G20 presidency. The president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, said he urged Joe Biden to seek Nato deployment of additional military equipment, including Himars artillery or attack helicopters, in the Baltic states. Nausėda, speaking to reporters, said he made the request to the US president while in a meeting with Bucharest Nine (B9) leaders of countries on Nato’s eastern flank. He said: I have talked about deployment of so-called critical enablers - this includes airspace surveillance systems, attack helicopters, Himars artillery. We can hardly afford to purchase this, it but it could be deployed (by allies) to the Baltics on rotational grounds. He said Biden was silent but took notes as he listened to Nausėda and others on deploying air defence systems in the Baltics and other eastern flank countries. Some of the B9 leaders discussed the prospect that Ukraine would be “several steps closer” to gaining Nato membership after a planned summit in July in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, Nausėda said. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Both chambers of Russia’s parliament voted today in favour of Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend the treaty. Interfax news agency has quoted Ryabkov as saying: I do not believe that the decision to suspend the New Start Treaty brings us closer to nuclear war. Meanwhile, a senior Russian defence official said Moscow will stick to agreed limits on nuclear missiles and keep informing the US about changes in its deployments, despite the treaty’s suspension. A top defence ministry official, Maj-Gen Yevgeny Ilyin, told the Duma that Russia would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes, Russian state-owned Ria news agency reported. Russia would also continue to provide the US with notifications on nuclear deployments in order “to prevent false alarms, which is important for maintaining strategic stability”, Ilyin was quoted as saying. President Joe Biden has been pictured boarding Air Force One, following his three-day visit to Poland and Ukraine. Russia has said it is studying China’s global security initiative (GSI), Xi Jinping’s flagship security proposal. On Tuesday, Beijing launched a government concept paper on Beijing’s plans for a global security initiative, first announced by Xi at the Boao forum in April 2022. The paper described the ideals and principles underpinning Beijing’s plan, rather than specific details or logistics. The initiative would be UN-backed, and “advocate a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country”, to resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, the paper said. It also explicitly rejected the use of sanctions – a long-held position of Beijing’s. It emphasised respect for “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”, which Beijing regularly cites in dismissing international criticism of its activities, including its plans to annex Taiwan. Speaking today, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: The positions of the two countries on the most pressing international issues coincide or are close, which the Russian and Chinese leadership has repeatedly spoken about. She added that China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, did not discuss a reported Chinese plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, Zakharova said: We note statements by some Western politicians and media reports regarding some kind of ‘Chinese peace plan’. As usual, they distort the real picture. She added: The Chinese partners briefed us on their views on the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, as well as approaches to its political settlement. There was no talk of any separate plan Joe Biden and the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9) east European Nato allies “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of this afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. The readout said the leaders “discussed the strengthened defensive posture on Nato’s eastern flank”. Nato has doubled its presence there over the past year, from four to eight multinational battle groups. There are 10,000 US soldiers now in Poland alone and the US has announced the establishment of a permanent base there, but the Poles and other east European leaders would have liked to see moves to build up eastern defences still further, ensuring a force that could repulse a Russian attack rather than simply acting as a tripwire. Further reinforcements are likely to be discussed at the Nato summit in Lithuania in July, when the leaders “looked forward to further strengthening alliance unity and collective defence”, according to the White House. President Joe Biden has now left the meeting with the Bucharest Nine (B9) in Warsaw, and boarded Air Force One, bringing an end to a historic trip to Ukraine and Poland ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sebastian Smith from AFP news agency writes that the American president stumbled as he climbed the stairs to his plane, before continuing up to the cabin. Two people have been killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine today, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40 km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike earlier today on the northeastern city of Kharkiv has also left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will meet UN secretary general, António Guterres, to discuss ongoing support for Ukraine as the UN’s security council meets this week, the US state department has said. Blinken is expected to travel to New York tomorrow to attend the security council meeting on Ukraine, marking one year of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The pair will discuss the broad range of economic, security, and humanitarian support the US and other UN member states are continuing to provide to Ukraine, the state department said in a statement. In particular, they will discuss “the imperative to sustain and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative as a vital means of addressing the global food security crisis”, it said. Subversive Slovenian industrial rock band Laibach are set to be the first foreign group to perform a full concert in Kyiv since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The group will play Bel Etage Music Hall on 31 March, under the concert title Eurovision – an arch reference to the fact the Eurovision song contest, won by Ukraine in 2022, will not be hosted in the country this year, but rather Liverpool in the UK. In a statement announcing the concert, the band said: While the rest of Europe prepares to celebrate its idea of freedom and solidarity on 9 May in Liverpool, Laibach is taking Eurovision back to Ukraine, where it belongs and where the only true and real vision of Europe is taking place right now. Proceeds from the concert will be donated to charity. Speaking to the Guardian via email as a group, they added: They say that while weapons speak, art is silent. We don’t agree with that. Some of the most important works of art and music were created during war. Even in the most unbearable times of holocaust, art gave meaning and power to life, to resist the violence of war. Read the full story here: All members of the Bucharest Nine (B9), the nations on Nato’s eastern flank, have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Leaders of the B9 have gathered for a meeting in Warsaw, along with President Joe Biden and Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. The Polish adviser told reporters: All allies agreed that they would support each other in the event of a threat. The next point of the declaration was the condemnation of the brutal, bloody war against Ukraine, which is being waged by Russia. All members of the Bucharest Nine signed these words. Fifteen minutes before midnight, a young Russian conscript named Danila, who had been sent to fight in Ukraine, picked up his phone to write a message to his family and friends back home in a small town in the Samara region. It was 31 December. “We congratulated each other, wished each other the best for the New Year, and then he was gone,” said a close friend who wrote with him that night. Minutes later, a US-made Himars rocket slammed into Professional Technical School No. 19 in Makiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine under Russian occupation. It took nearly 50 days for Danila’s remains to be identified beneath the rubble. His family spent weeks calling local hospitals and a military hotline, where they were told to wait for news that never seemed to come. The massive strike that killed at least 100 soldiers from a single Russian region, most of them mobilised to fight in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, exhibits the tensions on the home front that have been stoked by the war, and how the Kremlin has dipped into a deep well of patriotism and propaganda to maintain its war effort despite the deaths of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers in the past year. The friend, who agreed to speak with the Guardian anonymously, described Danila, in his early 20s, as a welder who had worked for an uncle in Crimea before returning to his native Samara for the weekend and receiving a summons to go to war. As a self-professed patriot who said he would “never let Russia be occupied”, he did not try to dodge the draft. “When he got his call-up papers, he immediately said that he was going,” said the friend. “He said: ‘What am I, some bum or loser to run away from this? That means my fate is to be a soldier.’” Read the full story here: Joe Biden told leaders from the Bucharest Nine countries that the US would defend “every inch” of Nato. The US president spoke alongside leaders of the eastern European nations in Warsaw, reiterating US support for the alliance. He said not only Ukraine was at stake, but “freedom”. At the UN general assembly in New York, a debate is due to begin due on a Ukrainian-drafted resolution calling for a Russian withdrawal and a cessation of hostilities. The resolution, co-sponsored by at least 70 countries, is intended as an alternative to peace proposals for an immediate ceasefire that would lock in the territorial gains Russia has made from its invasion. It is the latest in a series of tests of strength at the UN general assembly, all of which Ukraine has won overwhelmingly. Ukrainian, US and European officials said they expected the resolution to win the support of over 130 of the 193 UN member states, with about 50 states abstaining, absenting themselves, or unable to vote due to unpaid UN membership dues. At a previous vote on the legality of the war in October, only Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria voted with Russia. The resolution reaffirms the UN body’s “commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders” It calls for Russia to “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine” and for “a cessation of hostilities”. In particular it appeals for “an immediate cessation of the attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine and any deliberate attacks on civilian objects, including those that are residences, schools, and hospitals.” The resolution also calls for legal accountability for war crimes “ensure justice for all victims and the prevention of future crimes.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. EU countries on Wednesday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. “There are several issues outstanding, including on rubber and reporting obligations of Russian assets in Europe,” said one of the sources, who all spoke under condition of anonymity due to confidentiatlity of the negotiations among the 27 EU states. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. Russia’s embassy in London has published some quotes from ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin’s interview with Al Arabiya News. In it, he says: The Kremlin is ready for peace talks at any moment. Peace talks started in April last year, but then the US and the UK decided that Ukraine should fight and they just stopped them, and the president of Ukraine has made a decree that there will not be peace talks at all. We cannot understand this. Ukraine has become a real danger for Russia. It has a big military potential, and we have to reduce this. The “special military operation will continue until its goals will be achieved. The common goal is to stop the discrimination and killing of Russians in Donbas. For eight years, the west chose not to see Kyiv regime’s hostilities against the Russia-speaking population in the east. Meanwhile, those people were being discriminated, shelled and killed. The frontline is now more or less stable, but we have to go further because Ukrainian armed forces continue to shell Donetsk. Kelin also spoke about the prospect of the west sending tanks and perhaps fighter jets to Ukraine. He told viewers “We have already destroyed all tanks that have been in Ukraine before. We have destroyed all tanks that have been sent from different countries. We are going to destroy new tanks when they arrive, as well as the jets.” The International Federation of Journalists said on Wednesday it had suspended the membership of Russia’s main journalism trade union after it established branches in occupied regions of Ukraine. “The IFJ is an organisation built on international solidarity, on principles of cooperation between member unions and respect for the rights of all journalists. The Russian Union of Journalists’ actions in establishing four branches in the annexed Ukrainian territories have clearly shattered this solidarity and sown divisions among sister unions,” the IFJ president, Dominique Pradalie, said in a statement, Reuters reported. The head of the Union of Russian Journalists told state news agency Tass that the move violated the IFJ’s charter and would hurt the world body financially because it would no longer receive substantial membership fees from Russia. Finland and Sweden are proceeding “hand-in-hand” towards Nato membership, the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, said on Wednesday, but added that Turkey controlled the decision to ratify the applications for the two Nordic countries. “We proceed hand in hand in terms of the things that are in our own hands,” Reuters reports Niinisto told a joint news conference with the Swedish and Norwegian prime ministers, but added: “Ratification is not in our hands.” Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, has tweeted to say that today’s meeting “reconfirms the strength of our ‘Bucharest nine’ format”. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, told Vladimir Putin that Beijing will play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting. Wang was quoted as saying: The Chinese side will, as in the past, firmly adhere to an objective and impartial position and play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis. In its readout of the meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang pledged to strengthen cooperation between the two countries. Wang told Putin that Beijing was willing to work with Russia to deepen political trust, extend pragmatic cooperation, and play a constructive role for both countries in promoting world peace and development, the Chinese ministry said. The Swiss government is seeking parliamentary approval to send 140m francs (£125m) in further humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Moldova, the government has said. Switzerland has already allocated 1.3bn francs to support Ukraine, including 270m francs to help people in the country and 1.03bn francs to support Ukrainians who have fled to Switzerland. The government said continued support was needed to improve the “precarious situation” of the people in Ukraine, where 40% of the population was reliant on aid. Foreign minister Ignazio Cassis, speaking at a news conference, said: In a humanitarian way, diplomatically, and with reconstruction in mind, we can support Ukraine. Most of the money - 114m francs - is earmarked for Ukraine, with 26m francs for Moldova. The aid envisaged includes shelters for schools, repairs to hospitals and energy infrastructure, or small loans to small agricultural businesses. Removal of mines and psychological and social support for the population are also among the projects which could be supported. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, spoke after Joe Biden, where he said he was “so pleased and so impressed” with the US president’s “outstanding leadership”. Biden’s visit to Kyiv sent a clear message of steadfast support to Ukraine and of the US's “ironclad commitment to the security of Europe”, Stoltenberg said. He said Vladimir Putin was “preparing for more war” and so Nato allies must sustain and step up support for Ukraine. “We must give Ukraine what they need to prevail,” he urged. Stoltenberg said: We don’t know when the war will end but when it does, we need to ensure that history does not repeat itself. We have seen Russian aggression over many years – Georgia in 2008, Crimea and Donbas in 2014, and then the full fledged invasion of Ukraine last year. We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression. Nato allies have never been more united. President Joe Biden has been speaking ahead of talks with leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9) and Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Biden says leaders of the B9 are the “frontlines” of Nato’s collective defence as well as “for the freedom of democracies through Europe and around the world”. He says the US has repeatedly stepped up to provide critical security assistance to Ukraine, and critical support to “literally millions” of refugees. Together we’ll continue our enduring support for Ukraine as they defend their freedom over the past year, with your countries around this table, providing collective leadership, He says it is “absolutely clear” that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato”. President Joe Biden has said Vladimir Putin “made a mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. During his state-of-the-nation address yesterday, Putin declared that Moscow was suspending its participation in the 2010 New START treaty. The Russian leader said Moscow could not accept US inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its Nato allies have openly declared the goal of Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. Both houses of Russia’s parliament have now voted to suspend the treaty. In his first comments since Putin’s announcement, Biden condemned the Russian decision to pull back from the treaty. Joe Biden is now meeting the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Biden is wrapping up his four-day visit to Poland and Ukraine with talks with B9 leaders, where he will seek to reassure that the US is highly attuned to the looming threats and America’s ironclad commitment to the mutual-defence treaty. Many within the alliance worry that Vladimir Putin could move to take military action against them next if he is successful in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s appearance on stage at the rally at Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium only lasted a few minutes, but he did take the chance to issue a rallying cry for Russians to get behind the country’s armed forces fighting in Ukraine. The Russian leader praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, adding that the “whole country” supports them. He then led the crowd in chants of “Russia, Russia, Russia”. Vladimir Putin has met China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to discuss cooperation between Beijing and Moscow. The Russian president also told Wang he was looking forward to a visit to Moscow by his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and to a deepening partnership between the two countries. Vladimir Putin has arrived at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to take part in a rally marking one year of the war in Ukraine and “Defender of the Fatherland” Day. The Financial Times’ Max Seddon has been covering the performances at the event, as well as Putin’s speech. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Vladimir Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war. It said: Russia’s likely permanent gains in Belarus present the west with a decision about how to deal with the potential future security landscape on Nato’s eastern flank. Russia’s federation council, the upper house of parliament, has approved Vladimir Putin’s move to suspend the New Start nuclear arms treaty, state media is reporting. The State Duma, Russia’s lower house, earlier also voted to approve the decision to suspend the pact – the country’s last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Putin announced the suspension in a major national address yesterday, claiming that Moscow could not accept US inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its allies have openly declared the goal of Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a leading humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing from bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks occurring in the home and in communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. “We are noticing higher levels of gender-based violence that is related to displacement,” she said. So support networks are not there and levels of stress among all members of the community, unfortunately, sometimes manifests itself in gender-based violence. So in collective shelters we’re noticing higher levels of that, as well as having cases referred to us. The IRC is currently focusing its relief efforts in the east and south-east of Ukraine where there is heavy shelling and fighting. It estimates that 17.6 million people in the country are in urgent need of humanitarian aid, while 6 million have been internally displaced. Zapasnik gave a recent example of a woman who was attacked in a collective shelter and fled, grabbing only her handbag and a jumper. After being found by police wandering the streets in her slippers, she was referred to the IRC which provided psychological support, money to buy clothes and organised access to a safe house. Zapasnik said sexual violence and domestic abuse were increasing. “High levels of stress tend to increase levels domestic violence as well,” she said. It’s a very sensitive topic and it’s something that that wasn’t discussed in Ukraine before the war so it is hard to discuss openly. We need to make sure that we do everything we can to protect women, including those that we’re working with.

India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. Six senior Indian government officials have told Reuters that the macroeconomic impact of the war in Ukraine would be discussed in this week’s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs, but that India does not want to deliberate on additional actions against Russia. One of the officials said: India is not keen to discuss or back any additional sanctions on Russia during the G20. The existing sanctions on Russia have had a negative impact on the world. On Tuesday, Japan’s finance minister said financial leaders of the G7 nations would meet tomorrow, on the sidelines of the G20 gathering in India, to discuss measures against Russia. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government has not openly criticised Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and instead called for dialogue and diplomacy to end the war. India has also sharply raised purchases of oil from Russia, its biggest supplier of defence hardware. During his meeting with Vladimir Putin, Wang Yi said “a crisis is always an opportunity” with regard to the international situation and said that the Sino-Russian relationship was “never dictated by any third parties”. Both leaders emphasised the importance of “multipolar” approaches to international affairs – a worldview that rejects what China describes as the United States’ “unipolar” approach to dominating global leadership. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi met Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in Moscow on Wednesday as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In brief televised remarks Wang said that China and Russia were ready to deepen their strategic cooperation. Earlier in the day Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expects to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Putin said that “Russian Chinese relations were proceeding as planned” and talked of reaching “new milestones” in areas such as bilateral trade. Putin also said that the two countries had “ongoing cooperation” in international affairs and expressed Russia’s gratitude to China. Putin described the international situation as “quite complicated” and said that Sino-Russian cooperation was “important for stabilising the international situation”. Spain plans to send six 2A4 Leopard tanks to Ukraine, defence minister Margarita Robles has been quoted as telling lawmakers. That number could increase over time, she said. We are repairing right now six Leopard 2A4 vehicles ... with the possibility - if needed and if our allies request it - of increasing that number. Robles said last month that Spain was open to sending German-made Leopard tanks and would act in coordination with its western allies, after Germany agreed to send the tanks and said Nato allies could do the same. Spain has 108 2A4 tanks, according to security and defence researcher Felix Arteaga of the Elcano thinktank. About half of Spain’s tanks are in its north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and 53 are mothballed at a military base in Zaragoza and would need to be refitted, he said. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. The ship was detected in the Belgian North Sea around mid-November last year, Vincent Van Quickenborne, the Belgian justice and North Sea minister, said in a statement headlined “Russian spy ship off our coast in November”. While the presence of Russian ships in the North Sea is not forbidden, Belgium said it was monitoring the situation closely, in the context of the war in Ukraine. Van Quickenborne said: We don’t know the exact motives of this Russian ship, but let’s not be naive. Especially if it behaves suspiciously close to our wind farms, undersea gas and data cables and other critical infrastructure. It comes after Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia has been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. A Russian ship was detected at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea as it tried to map out energy infrastructure, MIVD head General Jan Swillens said at a news conference on Monday. Meanwhile in Moscow, thousands of people are gathering at Luzhniki stadium for a rally-concert marking one year of the war and the “Defenders of the Fatherland” Day. Vladimir Putin is expected to attend and speak later. The New York Times’ Valerie Hopkins is at the stadium: The Moscow Times reports that a governmental institution forced 70% of its workers to go to today’s pro-war rally, where organisers have also promised to distribute hot meals and Russian flags to attendees. The paper quotes one state employee as saying: To be honest, I think it’s absurd. We have to go and there’s nothing we can do with it. The authorities are using it as a propaganda tool to show off in the eyes of Z-patriots and those who watch TV. I wouldn’t go to the event voluntarily. As we reported, Vladimir Putin is meeting China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, had earlier confirmed the Russian leader’s meeting with Wang. Wang also met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, earlier today where he said he looked forward to clinching new agreements during his visit. Wang, speaking through an interpreter, said: I am ready to exchange views with you, my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest, and I look forward to reaching new agreements. He added: No matter how the international situation changes, China has been and remains committed, together with Russia, to make efforts to preserve the positive trend in the development of relations between major powers. He added that he would work to “strengthen and deepen” relations between Moscow and Beijing. President Vladimir Putin is meeting the top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi, in Moscow, according to pictures. The pair were pictured sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, as shared by the BBC’s Stephen McDonell. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the Russia-Ukraine war live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Vladimir Putin’s threat to suspend Russian participation in New Start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US, represents a blatant attempt to divide American opinion over the war on Ukraine by raising the specter of nuclear armageddon, experts and policymakers warned on Tuesday. Putin announced his intention to halt participation in the agreement towards the end of a belligerent 100-minute speech in which he charged the US and western powers with trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Russia. His fiery rhetoric prompted instant reaction across the political spectrum in Washington. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who was a Russian specialist at the White House National Security Council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”. The strategy was to increase political discord in an attempt to embolden calls for an end to US support for Ukraine. She said: It’s playing to all those people who want Ukraine to surrender and capitulate to avoid a massive nuclear exchange and world war three, a kind of nuclear armageddon. Thomas Graham, Russia director within George W Bush’s National Security Council, agreed that part of Putin’s calculation was to provoke “certain circles in the US to wonder whether the risks of supporting Ukraine are worth it”. Read the full story by Ed Pilkington and J Oliver Conroy: Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, reported that two people have been injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said a shopping mall has been struck by Ukrainian fire in the Russian town of Shebekino, severely injuring one person. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the United Nations this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit as an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. A group of 10 EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the United Nations’ behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the United Nations nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing you over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Anton Gerashchenko, who is former deputy minister in the internal affairs department of Ukraine, and currently acts as an adviser, has suggested in a post on Telegram that Ukraine should work with Moldova to restore territorial integrity to the latter. In a post he tagged “my opinion”, Geraschenko said: If the people of Moldova and the authorities decide to restore territorial integrity, then with the support of Nato and Ukraine, this can be done in 24 hours. Now Moldova has a unique geopolitical and historical chance to gain independence from Russia. The separatist enclave of Transnistria, which exists solely due to the support of the Russian Federation, has been “sandwiched” between Moldova and Ukraine for a year now. Moldova needs to muster up the courage and, with the support of Nato allies and Ukraine, to restore its territorial integrity, using all available methods for this. Thus, Chișinău, instead of Kyiv, should end the 30-year history of mockery of Moldovan independence. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted to Telegram to say that a shopping mall has been struck in the Russian town of Shebekino. He wrote: The shelling of Shebekino. Shells hit the mall, causing it to catch fire. According to preliminary data, there is one victim. A man with shrapnel wounds was taken to the Central district hospital. Doctors assess his condition as extremely serious. All necessary assistance is provided. Operational services are on site, rescuers have begun extinguishing [the fire]. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the United Nations this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. The Black Sea grain initiative brokered by the UN and Turkey last July allowed grain to be exported from three Ukrainian ports. The agreement was extended in November and will expire on 18 March unless an extension is agreed. “A formal proposal will come out from us this week on the need to work on an extension,” Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, told Reuters in an interview. He said the exact date of the talks, which have previously taken place in Turkey, had not yet been set. “We will request … to extend it not for 120 days but for at least one year because the Ukrainian and global agricultural market needs to be able to plan these volumes in the long term,” Vaskov said. He said Ukraine would insist on an increase in the number of inspection teams “in order to eliminate the accumulation of vessels waiting for inspections”. Vaskov said Mykolaiv’s ports, which accounted for 35% of Ukrainian food exports before the Russian invasion, were ready to join the initiative and would need a maximum of two weeks to start operations. He said Kyiv did not see Russia’s occupation of the Kinburn spit as an obstacle to adding Mykolaiv’s ports to an extended deal. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. “If the ports (of Mykoliav) are included in the initiative, there will be an obligation not to attack ships carrying agricultural products, which can work even in the current situation,” Vaskov said. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. Francis, who has appealed for an end to violence in Ukraine at nearly every public appearance since Russia’s invasion of the country on 24 February 2022, spoke at his weekly general audience at the Vatican. “It has been a year since the start of this absurd and cruel war, a sad anniversary,” he said. “The number of dead, wounded, refugees and displaced people, the destruction and economic and social damage speak for themselves,” Francis said. Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, attended the audience along with a delegation of Ukrainian officials. “May the Lord forgive so many crimes and so much violence. He is the God of peace. Let us remain close to the martyred Ukrainian people who continue to suffer,” Reuters reports Francis said. A group of ten EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The ten countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. In an informal paper the group argues that special attention should be given to western components used in Russian weaponry and military equipment, parts that are not easily replaced and could disrupt Russia’s military production if they were to disappear. They write: We see that Russia is transitioning into a full-on military economy with a view to sustaining its war efforts. Alternative supply chains are created through the use of front companies and intermediates in the circle of countries around Russia. Special focus should be put on western components that are crucial to the Russian military industry. A small disruption of these production chains therefore quickly has a significant impact in the Russian ability to produce weapons and military equipment. The recommendations include: Better cooperation between national and EU authorities, to ensure good information sharing between customs, tax authorities, prosecutors and intelligence. Better information sharing between national capitals and Brussels. Issuing warnings to individuals and companies in non-EU countries helping Russia evade sanctions that their help for Moscow risks “severe consequences for their access to the internal market”. Diplomatic coordination on how to deal with non-EU countries helping Russia evade sanctions. Creating a watchlist of companies and sectors of concern to raise awareness. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. In a letter to EU defence ministers seen by the Guardian, he promised proposals ahead of a meeting in Stockholm on 7-8 March. The European Commission intends to reimburse member states for ammunition sent to Ukraine and carry out joint procurement through the European Peace Facility, an EU military fund. The EPF has released €3.6bn to pay for military equipment for Ukraine over the last twelve months. Borrell writes “As a matter of urgency, I call on all of you to speed up the delivery of ammunition that you could provide from your stocks… The future of Ukraine is at stake.” Just a few miles from the Ukraine’s southern frontline, Russian missiles have been pummelling a village near Zaporizhzhia, and turned a newly refurbished medical clinic into a ravaged, abandoned shell. The Guardian’s Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry meet civilians who have refused to flee the bombardment and troops who are determined to fight back. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has posted to Telegram to report that two people have been injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv this morning, where there have been reports of at least four explosions being heard. He wrote: According to preliminary data, ‘arrivals’ were recorded in Kharkiv. Infrastructure objects were in the sights of the occupiers. According to the regional centre of emergency medical assistance, two people were injured. They are in a light condition and are being treated by specialists. Early reports seem to indicate there have been at least four explosions in Kharkiv this morning so far. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports its correspondents in Kharkiv have heard explosions. Several people have posted to social media to note the same. Denis Pushilin, who is the leader of the occupied Donetsk region which Russia claims to have annexed, has posted a message to the Telegram app warning citizens that he anticipates increased Ukrainian military activity as the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of approaches. He told residents: Dear friends, we know from experience that the enemy is always active on anniversaries. There is information that in the next two-three days shelling by Ukrainian armed forces will intensify. Our artillery units are engaged in active battery and counter-battery combat, air defence is in an enhanced mode. Nevertheless, please be careful, do not move around the streets without unnecessary need. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Reuters reports the Lithuania presidential office has said the Vilnius summit on 11-12 July will be attended by most leaders of the Atlantic alliance, including the US president, Joe Biden. “That is our plan,” ambassador Petro Beshta said about the Zelenskiy visit in an interview with BNS published on Wednesday. Zelenskiy has made only two foreign trips since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago – one to Washington in December and another to London, Paris and Brussels in February. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Tass reports the Russian emergencies ministry issued the following statement: The ministry of emergency situations of Russia reports that this information is fake and does not correspond to reality. We kindly ask you to follow the messages in official sources. Tass reports the department added that as a result of a hacker attack on the servers of some commercial radio stations in several regions, information about the alleged announcement of an air raid alert and the threat of a missile strike was broadcast. During the last twelve months Russia has claimed that targets within Russia, most usually in the Kursk and Belgorod regions which border Ukraine, have been struck by fire from inside Ukraine. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the United Nations’ behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Reuters reports that in a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the United Nations nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is under the control of Russian forces, without good reason. Russian officials on Wednesday continued to blame the US and the west for President Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend Moscow’s participation in the New Start treaty, as Russia’s parliament looked set to rubber-stamp the move. Reuters reports ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of the Russian security council, said the move was a “long overdue” response to the US and Nato in effect declaring war on Russia. “This decision was forced on us by the war declared by the US and other Nato countries on our country. It will have a huge resonance in the world overall and in the United States in particular,” Medvedev said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The head of Russia’s Duma, the lower house of parliament, also blamed the US for the breakdown. “By ceasing to comply with its obligations and rejecting our country’s proposals on global security issues, the US destroyed the architecture of international stability,” Vyacheslav Volodin said in a statement. My colleague Peter Beaumont reports that air raid sirens are sounding again in Kyiv. Here are some images that have been sent over the news wires from Russian-oocupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. While the foreign ministry has said it would continue abiding by the treaty’s restrictions, a suspension of the treaty may mean that it will be harder for the US to monitor compliance. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts say it would be a serious blow if Putin went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments. John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the move is “entirely symbolic”. He believes that Putin made the announcement to pressure Biden into approaching Russia about ending the war, “so Russia can dictate the terms under which that would happen”. In a speech ahead of the upcoming one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New Start. Signed by then US president Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2010, the New Start treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy. Together, the US and Russia own 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. In this context, “deploy” means ready for immediate use, rather than have in storage. Weapons kept in storage are “non-deployed”. According to an explainer of the treaty written by the EU parliament, “Warheads count as deployed if loaded onto a missile that is itself deployed”. Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are committed to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers. Each side can conduct up to 18 inspections of strategic nuclear weapons sites every year to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years after Joe Biden took office. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported on Wednesday. South Africa was due to launch the joint exercises on Friday. It calls the drills routine but they have fuelled domestic criticism and fears they could endanger relations with western partners. The beginning of the exercises coincides with the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend its last major nuclear arms control treaty with the United States The ship, named “The Admiral Gorshkov of the Fleet of the Soviet Union”, had arrived at Richards Bay “performing the tasks of a long-range voyage”, RIA reported, citing a statement from the Russian Northern Fleet. The Gorshkov warship, which was sent off from Russia on 4 January, carries the Zircon missiles which have a range of 900 km (560 miles) and can travel at several times the speed of sound, making it difficult to defend against them. In late January, the ship tested its strike capabilities in the western Atlantic Ocean. The UN general assembly meets today, two days ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Kyiv and its allies hoping to garner broad support for a resolution calling for a “just and lasting peace.” The draft resolution, sponsored by 60 countries, is to be voted on after the close of debate – not expected until at least Thursday. The text “underscores the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” Like previous resolutions, it reaffirms the UN’s “commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine” and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Russia’s first criminal case against a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, accused of forcibly seizing power and ill-treatment of civilians, has gone to court, the state TASS news agency reported on Wednesday. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on the Telegram messaging platform in June that it had charged Senior Sergeant Anton Cherednik of the Marine Corps of Ukraine’s forces with the alleged crime of cruel treatment of civilian population. TASS, citing unnamed sources at the Southern District Military Court in Russia’s Rostov-on-Don, said that Cherednik was also charged with murder and training for the purpose of carrying out terrorism. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports and the charges. TASS said the court will consider the case “in the near future. More now on Biden’s meeting today with the Bucharest Nine. Most members of the group – made up of the countries on Nato’s eastern flank who joined the western military alliance after being dominated by Moscow during the cold war – are strong supporters of military aid to Ukraine, and officials from countries in the group have called for additional resources such as air defence systems. At the meeting, Biden plans to reaffirm commitments over their security and discuss support for Ukraine before he returns to Washington. Russia regards Nato, which could soon expand to include Sweden and Finland, as an existential threat. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda’s message to Biden will be that it wants “greater involvement of the US in Europe, Nato’s eastern flank and, of course, more aid to Ukraine,” his chief foreign policy adviser told Lithuanian radio on Tuesday. “Lithuania and other like-minded countries have several requests, which concern air defence, forward defence presence, air defence systems, and greater investments in the defence industry,” Asta Skaisgiryte said. The former Soviet republic on Russia’s doorstep joined Nato in 2004 and plans to host Biden in July for the security alliance’s leaders’ summit. As the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches on Friday, the picture looks very different to the first weeks of the war, when hundreds of Russian tanks poured over the border and airborne forces attempted to capture Hostomel airfield, outside Kyiv, as a springboard to take the capital. Here we look at the status of the conflict and what might happen next. There are different ways to assess who is winning the war. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is close to achieving its stated war aims, which in Ukraine’s case involves liberating all occupied territory. It is probably safe to say that the current trajectory of the conflict is going much better for Ukraine than for Russia – and that the continuing influx of new weapons from the west will maintain that trajectory. But Ukraine, as the EU’s head of foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, warned recently, is heavily dependent on the west for arms, including artillery ammunition, which has exposed a potential vulnerability for Kyiv in the east, where artillery has dominated the battles. What is also unclear is how much of a gamechanger weapons such as main battle tanks are likely to be in bringing the war towards a close, or how quickly. So for now, the war grinds on. Read more on where things stand here: Kazakhstan may send the first batch of oil via Russia’s Druzhba pipeline to Germany in the coming days, possibly on Wednesday, Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Kazakhstan’s Energy Minister Bolat Akchulakov as saying on Wednesday. “I really hope that it will go today,” Akchulakov said. Kazakh supplies are meant to replace those of Russian crude that the European Union pledged to stop buying as part of wider sanctions prompted by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline remains exempt from sanctions, but Germany’s refineries in Leuna and Schwedt - which are connected to the pipeline - have not ordered any Russian crude for this year. Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking region wedged between the Dniester River and the Ukraine border. It seceded from Moldova after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1992, the separatists fought a war with Moldova’s pro-western government, which ended in hundreds of deaths and the intervention of the Russian army on the rebels’ side. In a 2006 referendum that was not recognised by the international community, 97.1% of voters backed joining Russia, dealing a blow to Moldova’s hopes of following Romania and other ex-communist eastern European states into the EU. Transnistria is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, has made clear her opposition to Transnistria’s secession. She wants Russian troops stationed along Transnistria’s frontier with Moldova to be replaced with an observer mission from the Organisation for Security and cooperation in Europe, a proposal rejected by Moscow. More on Transnistria here: The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has said Moscow’s military chiefs are refusing to supply the group with munitions and are seeking to destroy it, accusing them of “treason”, in an escalation of the war of words between senior Russian officials and the private army boss. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenary force, which has recruited from prisons across Russia to bolster its ranks, is playing a key role in the efforts to capture the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east. The battle has exposed tensions between the Wagner group and the Russian army, though the Kremlin denies any rift. “[Moscow’s] chief of general staff and the defence minister give out orders left and right not only to not give ammunition to PMC Wagner, but also to not help it with air transport,” Prigozhin said in a voice message shared by his press service on Tuesday. “There is just direct opposition going on, which is nothing less than an attempt to destroy Wagner. This can be equated to high treason,” he added. Russia’s defence ministry has denied limiting ammunition shipments to volunteers at the front, but made no mention of the Wagner group private army or of Prigozhin’s accusations. “All requests for ammunition for assault units are met as soon as possible,” it insisted, promising new deliveries on Saturday and denouncing as “absolutely false” reports of shortages. “Attempts to create a split within the close mechanism of interaction and support between units of the Russian [fighting] groups are counter-productive and work solely to the benefit of the enemy,” the statement read: Putin has revoked a 2012 decree that in part underpinned Moldova’s sovereignty in resolving the future of the Transdniestria region – a Moscow-backed separatist region which borders Ukraine and where Russia keeps troops. The decree, which included a Moldova component, outlined Russia’s foreign policy 11 years ago which assumed Moscow’s closer relations with the European Union and the United States. The order revoking the 2012 document was published on the Kremlin’s website and states that the decision was taken to “ensure the national interests of Russia in connection with the profound changes taking place in international relations”. It is part of a series of anti-western moves announced by Putin on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden is still in Poland, where he will meet with leaders of the so-called “Bucharest Nine” countries, Nato’s eastern European members, and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg. The Bucharest Nine, or B9, was formed in 2015 in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. Its members are Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia. Biden is expected to return to Washington on Wednesday evening. On Tuesday he delivered a speech in Warsaw in which he rallied the allies, saying, “When Russia invaded, it wasn’t just Ukraine being tested. The whole world faced a test for the ages.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Coming up today: US President Joe Biden is in Warsaw, Poland, where he will meet with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the ‘Bucharest Nine’ nations, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia. And Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched two verbal attacks against top brass on Tuesday, accusing them of depriving his Wagner fighters of munitions in what he called a treasonous attempt to destroy his private military company. More on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Ukraine told schools on Tuesday to hold classes remotely from 22-24 February because of the risk of Russian missile strikes around the first anniversary of Moscow’s 2022 invasion. Speaking before a crowd of thousands in the gardens of Warsaw’s Royal Castle, Joe Biden hailed the resilience of Ukraine’s people and the benevolence of Poland and other western allies in helping fend off the Russian invasion. The US president said the attack on Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, and said new sanctions against Russia will be announced this week. The foreign ministers of the G7 have said their countries would continue to impose economic costs on Russia and urged the broader international community to reject what they described as Moscow’s “brutal expansionism”. Russian president Vladimir Putin has given a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin also announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it could have deployed. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he regretted Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty and urged Moscow to reconsider. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the frontline in the east after Russia reported it was advancing on its main target in the area. Russia, trying to secure full control of two eastern provinces forming Ukraine’s Donbas industrial region, has launched repeated assaults, securing its biggest gains around the mining city of Bakhmut. Eighteen Russian MPs are expected to attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Friday, the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and have been invited to a nationalist ball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/feb/26/a-spell-of-good-things-by-ayobami-adebayo-review-a-blistering-indictment-of-the-abuse-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"A Spell of Good Things by Ayòbámi Adébáyò review – a blistering indictment of the abuse of power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/a-spell-of-good-things-by-ayobami-adebayo-review-a-blistering-indictment-of-the-abuse-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/feb/26/a-spell-of-good-things-by-ayobami-adebayo-review-a-blistering-indictment-of-the-abuse-of-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Chronic corruption and poor investment in health and education are responsible for many of Nigeria’s woes. Set in Osun state in the early 00s, Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s compelling second novel explores the country’s inequalities and contradictions. A Spell of Good Things interweaves the fates of two families and describes how political failings affect their lives and lead to personal tragedy. Yèyé, the matriarch of a well-off middle-class household, recognises that good fortune is precarious: “Life was war, a series of battles with the occasional spell of good things.” She hoards her gold jewellery and dreams of marrying her eldest daughter, Wúràolá, an exhausted resident doctor, to their friends’ son, Kúnlé. From bitter experience, Yèyé knew that “real wealth was intergenerational” and “parentage would often matter more than your qualifications”. A patriarchal society obliges women to conform to familial expectations. However well educated they are, a good marriage is essential: “The husband’s house was the destination of all good girls when they became women, just as heaven was the destination of all good people when they died.” Representing a younger, more outspoken generation, Wúràolá’s feisty sister, Mótárá, counts the times she is reminded how to “behave in her marriage, in her husband’s house, towards her in-laws”. Extreme poverty exists alongside obscene opulence. Adébáyò illustrates what happens when the two worlds collide. After their father loses his job as a teacher, 16-year-old Eniolá and his family are beset by hardship. Eniolá and his bright sister Bùsólá’s education is abruptly curtailed and their mother resorts to begging to pay their school fees. Both families recognise the importance of education, but only one has the means to fulfil their children’s academic aspirations. Eniolá meets Yèyé at the local tailor’s where he runs errands, unable to afford an apprenticeship. Adébáyò vividly conveys how deprivation fuels Eniolá’s descent from determined schoolboy to politician’s thug. This immensely readable novel is a blistering indictment of the abuse of power (political and domestic) and the ubiquitous violence that can destroy lives overnight. A Spell of Good Things by Ayòbámi Adébáyò is published by Canongate (£18.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

Thanks for joining us. It has been an extraordinary and historic day in China. Here are the main developments: China’s Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term on Sunday and introduced a new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists, cementing his place as the country’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong. Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang is likely to succeed Li Keqiang as premier when he retires in March. The other members of the seven-man Standing Committee, China’s top governing body, are Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, who return from the previous committee, and newcomers Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi. Li Qiang is also new to the Standing Committee. All are perceived to have close allegiance to Xi, 69, who was also re-appointed on Sunday as chairman of the Central Military Commission. The unveiling of the Standing Committee and the larger 24-member Politburo comes a day after the closing of the ruling Communist Party’s 20th Congress, where amendments were added to the party charter aimed at cementing the core status of Xi and the guiding role of his political thought within the party. The new Politburo contains no women members, where previously there was at least one, and has reduced in number to 24 from 25. The Standing Committee lineup is further confirmation that Xi’s grip on power is undiminished by the events of a tumultuous year, including a sharp economic slowdown, frustration over his zero-Covid policy, and China’s increasing estrangement from the West, exacerbated by his support for Russia’s Vladimir Putin. More from Helen Davidson – the Standing Committee was formally selected by the powerful Politburo, the ranks of which were also revealed on Sunday. Shockingly, the new Politburo contains no women members, where previously there was at least one, and has reduced in number to 24 from 25. Xi and the members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Here is some more reaction via Reuters: Ja Ian Chong, political scientist, National University of Singapore. “It certainly seems to be a consolidation of Xi’s position. This means that policies will be more directly attached to Xi for good or ill. I guess that translates to more focus on party-state control over business, less dependence on imports even as the PRC (People’s Republic of China) seeks to export. So probably more direct party-state direction of the economy. Investment will likely seek to meet those above goals, especially if they can bring in technology. So while there may be opportunities for investors, they have to look to both market forces and political preferences more. So more of what we have already been seeing. “Probably no lifting of Covid-zero policy in the near future, and more assertiveness in foreign and security. Even more broadly, US-PRC friction will continue to grow.” Dylan Loh, assistant professor, Nanyang Technology University: “It’s quite clear that the Politburo have been stacked with Xi loyalists and that would mean he has a much freer rein and mandate in pursuing his domestic and foreign policies as collective leadership and decision making has been de-emphasised over coalescing around Xi and implementing his decisions. It seems that he has not elevated a potential successor for now, which gives him the flexibility for a fourth term. Regarding investment, I do not think China’s policies will turn sharply because of this line up, I think by and large Xi’s priorities have not changed.” “Wang Huning’s presence also indicates to me that the ideological bent of the party and Xi will continue and even deepen.” Helen Davidson has some snap reaction to Xi’s speech: Quite a short speech from Xi Jinping just then, announcing the line-up of the new Standing Committee. All are seen as Xi loyalists, with the surprise addition of Cai Qi. Hu Chunhua was nowhere to be seen. 59-year-old Hu was considered to be the least Xi-aligned prospect and, having risen through the ranks as a member of the Communist Youth League faction, was perceived by some analysts as a potential threat to Xi - in as much as that is possible in the current context. Xi’s speech touched on several of the same points he made during his 104-minute address at last Sunday’s Congress opening. He warned again of “choppy waters” and “dangerous” storms in China’s future dealings with the world. But he said China’s economy would continue “opening up”, and with global development and Chinese development both needing each other. China has hit economic troubles in the last year or so, with major slowdowns in growth. But he said China had created the twin miracle of fast economic growth and long term social stability, and these fundamentals would not change - suggesting the tight grip he has over the people’s lives and freedoms would remain. He praised the successes of the CCP in boosting the prosperity of the Chinese people, and reaffirmed commitments to grow even more, into a “modern socialist nation”. He again pledged to achieve “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, a goal which requires the annexing of Taiwan. Before leaving the stage, he invited the world’s media to visit China, saying he “welcomes unbiased and truthful stories about China”. He then takes no questions. Some analysis is coming in via Reuters: “In terms of policymaking, it does mean that there is likely to be more deference to Xi Jinping’s own views about how to move the country and the economy forward,” said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore. “An abnormally lopsided victory for one faction, which is rare in the tradition of the Communist Party, in the past there would be a rough balance of power,” said Willy Lam, Senior Fellow at US think tank the Jamestown Foundation. “It means there won*t be any checks and balances. Xi Jinping also has total control over the larger Politburo and Central Committee,” he said. Economic growth ‘downgraded’ as key party goal Chris Miller, professor at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said Congress has “reaffirmed Xi’s decisive role in ruling the Communist Party, marking a continued shift away from collective leadership of party elites toward a personalised dictatorship.” “It also appears to have confirmed the downgrading of economic growth as a key party goal, relative to other agenda items such as zero-Covid and the party’s political and ideological control. “On tech, the key theme was self-sufficiency in science and technology, which is to be expected given the increasing decoupling of the US and Chinese tech sectors,” professor Miller said. Li Qiang, the party secretary of Shanghai and a Xi ally, is likely to be appointed the next premier after Li Keqiang steps down from premiership in March after two terms. After it was revealed on Saturday that Wang Yang, previously thought to be a top contender for the post, was excluded from the list of some 200 central committee members, Li emerged to be a strong premier candidate in his current capacity as Shanghai’s party chief. Shanghai has historically been a breeding ground for top national leaders. While Li’s prospects might have been dented by the chaos of Shanghai’s protracted Covid lockdown, analysts say Xi values loyalty and trustworthiness above all and Li’s strong rapport with Xi over the years has put him in good stead. Li was Xi’s chief of staff from 2004 to 2007 when Xi was Zhejiang province’s top party boss. After Xi became China’s top leader, he promoted Li first to governor of Zhejiang and then party secretary of Jiangsu province, providing him with the regional governing experience and credentials he needed for bigger roles. Unlike most of the previous premiers, Li had no experience as a vice premier, but analysts say Li could be made a vice-premier in the next few months by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and could then be appointed premier in March. Li has proven himself to be a loyal follower of Xi - even when Shanghai’s two-month Covid lockdown caused widespread discontent and exacted heavy economic cost, Li insisted on strictly implementing the “zero Covid” policy in Shanghai according to “the spirit of the important instructions by Party Secretary Xi Jinping.” Cai Qi was the big surprise entry to the PSC. Although he had featured on some long-lists of potential candidates, the Beijing party secretary had not been widely tipped as a likely member. His entry is another sign of how Xi values both loyalists and people he knew rising up through the ranks. Like Xi, he spent many years in Fujian province at the start of his career, and moved on to Zhejiang. More recently he has been a prominent champion of the Zero Covid policy embraced by Xi, and successfully oversaw the 2022 winter Olympics. Xi ended his speech with an invitation to the world’s journalists to visit China. It’s worth noting that conditions for journalists - both foreign and local - have diminished greatly under Xi’s rule. US journalists from major outlets were expelled in 2020. Some quick reaction from China watchers: Xi Jinping has finished speaking. Reuters reports that Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang followed Xi onto the stage at the Great Hall of the People, meaning he is likely to succeed Li Keqiang as premier when he retires in March. The other members of the seven man Standing Committee, China’s top governing body, are Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, who return from the previous committee, and newcomers Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi. All are perceived to have close allegiance to Xi. The speech is ongoing. “China’s development can’t leave the world and the world’s development also needs China,” says Xi. Xi says China has created the twin miracle of fast economic growth and long term social stability. These fundamentals will not change. China will “open its door ever wider”, and will pursue “high quality development” he says, using a term which is being increasingly heard from Chinese officials no longer able to talk about China’s high speed growth which has dramatically slowed in recent months. Xi is still speaking. He has said China must remain on high alert for challenges “like a student on never-ending exams”. He says the party “can only become invincible if it is committed to self reform, even if it has had a glorious past.” He said the party is stronger and more dynamic because of its struggles and achievements in the last century. Xi’s political thought now officially drives the party’s ideology - not just because he is the current leader but also after constitutional changes this week enshrined him as being at the “core” of the party. Here is Xi Jinping (C) and other new members of the Communist Party of China’s Politburo Standing Committee: Xi is repeating his warnings of “choppy waters” and “dangerous storms” to come - it’s heightened language compared to previous meetings which were more focused on peace and development, and reflects how much more isolated China has become from the west, with numerous disputes and tensions. Xi is praising the CCP’s work in achieving its first centenary goal of “moderate prosperity for all”, and says the work now is for the second goal of achieving a modern socialist nation, and the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” - a goal which requires the annexation of Taiwan. “We have fought long and hard to open a Chinese path to modernisation,” he says. “The enormity of the task is what makes it great and infinitely glorious… Successive generations of Chinese have devoted themselves to this glorious goal. We should always remember their dedication and sacrifice.” A loyal stalwart of Xi Jinping, Li Xi is already part of the top leader’s core inner circle. Li started his career in the party’s powerful the Organisation Department and rose steadily through the ranks in a series of key positions in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanghai, Liaoning, and finally Guangdong over a period of 18 years. As the party chief of affluent Guangdong province which borders Hong Kong, he has already been in the 25-member Politburo for the past five years and is one of the most powerful non-Standing Committee politicians in the country. Li is the top official responsible for the development of the Greater Bay Area, Xi’s master plan for an integrated economic powerhouse of nine Chinese cities with Hong Kong and Macau. “I was reelected as the general secretary of the CPC central committee,” Xi says, before presenting the six other members. They are: Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi Xi Jinping has been confirmed as leader of China for a precedent-breaking third term, after a week-long political meeting eliminated key rivals and strengthened his political power. Xi and the six members of the new Politburo Standing Committee have just walked on stage. Xi has been confirmed as the general secretary and is going to make some remarks. Xi Jinping has walked out at the front the group. The press conference is beginning – stay tuned. The stage is set in Beijing: Xi Jinping opened the Congress meeting last week with a speech laying out his vision for the next five years in China. Helen Davidson and Emma Graham-Harrison looked at the key take-aways: Some scenes from the party congress area over the past few days: Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China’s leadership has remained unchanged. It is all male. Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping’s “new era” of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country. The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made President or Premier. Emma Graham-Harrison asks, where are the women at the top of Chinese politics? On Saturday Xi Jinping strengthened his power as leader and elevated his status within Communist party (CCP) history, with major political resolutions announced on the final day of a key political meeting. The CCP congress approved amendments to its constitution, including the “Two Establishes” and “Two Safeguards”, aimed at enshrining Xi as at the core of the party and his political thought as its underpinning ideology. A list of reappointed delegates also confirmed the premier, Li Keqiang, would be retiring from politics, along with several other senior party figures. Analysts said their exclusion was a strong sign that the next politburo standing committee (PSC), to be unveiled on Sunday, would be dominated by Xi’s allies and his power would be further consolidated. Helen Davidson has the details here: Verna Yu has spoken to some experts about Xi’s third term could mean for China. Chen Daoyin, a political commentator formerly with Shanghai University of Political Science and Law said after the 20th party congress, China is expected to continue its current conservative and hawkish stance. He said domestically, it will continue to suppress dissent and internationally, it will be confrontational and adopt the “dare to fight” spirit as mentioned by Xi many times during the congress. He expects China to clash with the United States and Europe on issues over sovereignty, security and development. “‘Struggle’ is the main theme of this congress: It will ‘struggle’ internally and externally. It will ‘dare to fight’ and be ready for tit for tat,” said Chen. Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank Jamestown Foundation, predicted the personality cult surrounding Xi will exacerbate. The party and country risk becoming a “one-voice chamber” where only one voice will be heard. The supreme leader has almost totally abandoned the institutional reforms started by Deng Xiaoping and largely followed by ex-presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. There was high drama at the closing of Congress on Saturday when former leader Hu Jintao was led out of the Great Hall of the People. Hu, who is 79, and stepped down as head of the party 10 years ago, seemed confused and reluctant to leave his seat on stage. His unexpected exit prompted rampant speculation. It is unclear why he was removed, but China’s official news agency said he was feeling unwell. Emma Graham-Harrison reported on Hu’s unscheduled departure: Today we are expecting Congress delegates to elect the Standing Committee - the apex of Chinese political power at which Xi is set to sit firmly at the top. The Standing Committee is then expected to be unveiled to foreign and domestic media at a press conference around noon (0400 GMT, 3pm AEST) at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. A list of officials in the new Central Committee earlier revealed that four out of seven members of the Standing Committee will be replaced, allowing Xi to further pack the top body with loyalists. “Whichever way you look at it, it’s almost a total victory for Xi,” Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Agence France-Presse. The move will allow Xi to get a third term as China’s president. So what exactly is the Chinese Communist party’s Congress meeting, and why is it so important? Helen Davidson has the answers. When Xi Jinping was 13 years old, at the height of China’s Cultural Revolution, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary before a frenzied crowd in Beijing. Among his accusers was his own mother, forced to join in the taunting. China’s future leader was targeted mostly because his father, a top Communist cadre, was purged by Chairman Mao Zedong. His fall dragged the family down too; Xi’s half-sister died, reportedly after intense abuse. Half a century later, the teenage boy publicly humiliated in the capital has become China’s most powerful ruler since Mao, and perhaps – given his singular control of a superpower – the most powerful man in the world. Hu Jintao ‘not feeling well’ when he left China congress, says state media Former Chinese president Hu Jintao was “not feeling well” when he was escorted out of the closing ceremony of a congress of the ruling Communist party on Saturday, according to state media. China’s official news agency Xinhua said in a tweet late on Saturday: “Xinhuanet reporter Liu Jiawen has learned that Hu Jintao insisted on attending the closing session of the party’s 20th national congress, despite the fact that he has been taking time to recuperate recently.” A second tweet said: “When he was not feeling well during the session, his staff, for his health, accompanied him to a room next to the meeting venue for a rest. Now, he is much better. Read the full story here: China’s president Xi Jinping is poised to secure a historic third term in power, cementing his position as the nation’s most influential leader since founder Mao Zedong. Xi is all but certain to be unveiled as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party again - tilting the country decisively back towards one-man rule after decades of power-sharing among its elite. His anointment will cap a week-long gathering of the party faithful in China’s capital during which high-ranking cadres endorsed his “core position” in the leadership and approved a sweeping reshuffle that saw several top officials step down.

Petraeus said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow. He told ABC News: “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato – a collective – effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.” The warning comes days after Putin expressed views that many have interpreted as a threat of a larger war between Russia and the west. Asked if the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine would bring America and Nato into the war, Petraeus said that it would not be a situation triggering the alliance’s Article 5, which calls for a collective defense. That is because Ukraine is not part of Nato – nonetheless, a “US and Nato response” would be in order, Petraeus said. Petraeus acknowledged that the likelihood that radiation would extend to Nato countries under the Article 5 umbrella could perhaps be construed as an attack on a Nato member. “Perhaps you can make that case,” he said. “The other case is that this is so horrific that there has to be a response – it cannot go unanswered.” Yet, Petraeus added, “You don’t want to, again, get into a nuclear escalation here. But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way.” Nonetheless, with pressure mounting on Putin after Ukrainian gains in the east of the country under last week’s annexation declaration and resistance to mobilization efforts within Russia mounting, Petraeus said Moscow’s leader was “desperate”. “The battlefield reality he faces is, I think, irreversible,” he said. “No amount of shambolic mobilization, which is the only way to describe it; no amount of annexation; no amount of even veiled nuclear threats can actually get him out of this particular situation. “At some point there’s going to have to be recognition of that. At some point there’s going to have to be some kind of beginning of negotiations, as [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy has said, will be the ultimate end.” But, Petraeus warned, “It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia. And even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield won’t change this at all.” Still, he added, “You have to take the threat seriously.” Senator Marco Rubio, the ranking Republican member of the Senate foreign relations committee, told CNN that Putin was down to two choices: established defensive lines or withdraw and lose territory. Rubio said he believed it “quite possible” that Putin could strike distribution points where US and allied supplies are entering Ukraine, including inside Poland. The senator acknowledged the nuclear threat, but he said most worries about “a Russian attack inside Nato territory, for example, aiming at the airport in Poland or some other distribution point”. “Nato will have to respond to it,” he said. “How it will respond, I think a lot of it will depend on the nature of the attack and the scale and scope of it.” But as a senator privy to Pentagon briefings, Rubio resisted being drawn on whether he’d seen evidence that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. “Certainly, the risk is probably higher today than it was a month ago,” Rubio said, predicting that Russia would probably take an intermediate step. “He may strike one of these logistical points. And that logistical point may not be inside … Ukraine. To me, that is the area that I focus on the most, because it has a tactical aspect to it. And I think he probably views it as less escalatory. Nato may not.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2022 to correct several misspellings of David Petraeus’s name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/oct/24/pan-pipes-pinot-noir-and-productivity-the-hidden-power-of-music-turn-it-up-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T09:08:26Z","webTitle":"Pan pipes, pinot noir and productivity: the hidden power of music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/24/pan-pipes-pinot-noir-and-productivity-the-hidden-power-of-music-turn-it-up-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/oct/24/pan-pipes-pinot-noir-and-productivity-the-hidden-power-of-music-turn-it-up-manchester","fields":{"bodyText":"I’m always happy to talk about my taste in music, but what about the taste of music? A new exhibition at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum is asking visitors to match certain types of music with tastes. Does this sound sweet, sour, bitter, salty? Ridiculous, you might think, and as I listen to each of the sounds – screechy, plinkety-plonky, lush, mournful – initially I am reluctant to make my selections, fearing ridicule in front of curator Steven Leech. But then something magical happens: the screechy music does indeed suddenly bring to mind bitter lemons and the lush sounds do conjure up strawberries. Leech’s music-meets-food exhibit is a fun way of interpreting a serious piece of research by Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University. It is the model for much of this new exhibition, Turn It Up, which takes the research being done into the effects of music at universities across the world and tries to make it accessible to a general audience. “The exhibition is about the way music affects our bodies and minds, and drives us to innovate, create and share,” says Leech. “We did some audience testing and found that the majority of the people, unless they played an instrument or could read music, felt ‘unmusical’ – ignoring the ubiquity of music in their lives and its centrality in our culture.” He aims to show that in fact almost everyone is musical and has an emotional response to what they hear. The exhibition is in two halves. The first looks at the innate human urge to create music and where our ingenuity and technological innovation have led. This section draws on objects, displaying a weird and wonderful collection of musical instruments, listening devices from ancient gramophones to the iPhone, and new tech that allows disabled musicians to make music. It also charts ongoing experiments with artificial intelligence. “The homeward-bound half is more reflective, thinking about the effect music has on us as individuals,” says co-curator Emily Scott-Dearing. We are programmed to respond to musical tropes – though whether as a result of cultural conditioning or something innate is far from clear. One exhibit demonstrates that a lullaby has certain musical qualities which are universally felt. Conversely, our brains are programmed to react adversely to dissonance. But Scott-Dearing insists cultural conditioning plays a part too. “In western music there are associations between major keys and happiness, and minor keys and sadness,” she explains, “but that is not universal across all music systems.” Music’s ability to relax us is well attested – Classic FM has built its entire marketing pitch around it – and Turn It Up looks at ways it is used for medical purposes, not least to treat dementia sufferers. “Manchester Camerata has a project called Music in Mind, which runs group music therapy sessions in care homes,” says Scott-Dearing, “and there was a study that found a significant reduction in medication use.” Music was taking the place of drugs in reducing agitation and distress among patients. Work is under way to produce an app which would allow this musical immersion treatment to be given remotely. Leech says the aim is to produce individualised “prescription playlists” that use sensors to track a patient’s mood through the day, and play pain-relieving songs when needed. Music has other measurable effects on us. One study has shown that supermarkets playing generic French or German music in their wine aisles – think accordions and oompah bands – affects the amount of wine they sell from those countries. Consumers don’t have to know what they are listening to; they subliminally absorb the musical message and buy accordingly. Other research suggests playing classical music in commercial environments makes consumers spend more money. “We have value associations that we put on music,” says Scott-Dearing, “and classical music is seen as high end.” Professor Adrian North has demonstrated that playing classical music rather than muzak or pop in a cafe can boost sales by 20%. Another study has shown that classical music encourages shoppers to buy luxury items, whereas country music prompts more utilitarian purchases. Fast music, meanwhile, makes you shop more quickly. That also explains why tunes by marching bands are sometimes played at London’s Waterloo station – to stop commuters lingering on the concourse. Underground stations also play soothing music to boost commuter well-being and encourage calm behaviour in situations that can become stressful. Can listening to music combat insomnia? My faith in whether sleep playlists work was somewhat undermined by learning at Turn It Up that one of the most common songs used by insomniacs is the dance track Dynamite by South Korean boy band BTS. But music to fall asleep to doesn’t have be soporific, Leech explains; familiarity can be more important. “If [music] makes you feel more comfortable and takes you to a different place, it can get you more prepared for sleep,” he says. The exhibition draws on the work of sleep researcher Kira Vibe Jespersen, though her findings offer no magic bullet for insomniacs. She has shown that playing music does not objectively improve your sleeping patterns, but can make you believe you have slept better, compared with, say, using audiobooks. Memory is another key theme of the show. Sometimes music triggers personal memories that become more important than the sound itself. Desert Island Discs demonstrates that week in, week out, playing the pieces that have become signposts in a person’s life. And that we set such store by the music played at the funerals of loved ones is no accident: it can encapsulate an attitude to life. Turn It Up tries to answer many questions. Some are broad and quasi-philosophical. How does the brain process music? Why does it trigger memory? Why does it make us dance? Others are more practical. What music, for instance, is best for a call centre to use while callers are on hold? Pleasant tunes without lyrics that appear to have no beginning and no end – callers don’t like to be reminded of the passage of time while they are hanging on. One experiment showed that they were more likely to stay on the line if the music was a version of Yesterday played on pan pipes, rather than the version with Paul McCartney singing it. His much-loved rendition made callers too attentive; zombification is the key here. So does listening to music while we work help or hinder productivity? The answer depends on what you are doing: it helps with mechanical tasks but is distracting if you are carrying out complex cognitive tasks. And what is the safest music to listen to while driving? Heavy metal surprisingly. Just joking – ballads are best. • Turn It Up: The Power of Music is at the Science and Industry Museum, Manchester, until 21 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T16:34:30Z","webTitle":"Libyan general says 2.5 tonnes of missing uranium found near storage base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 2 tonnes of natural uranium reported missing by the UN’s nuclear watchdog in war-torn Libya have been found, a general in the country’s east has said. Gen Khaled al-Mahjoub, the commander of eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar’s communications division, said the containers of uranium had been recovered barely 5km (3 miles) from where they had been stored in southern Libya, and after the International Atomic Energy Agency reported their disappearance earlier on Thursday. The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told the organisation’s member states that inspectors on Tuesday found that 10 drums containing approximately 2.5 tonnes of uranium ore concentrate “were not present as previously declared”. Natural uranium cannot immediately be used for energy production or bomb fuel, as the enrichment process typically requires the metal to be converted into a gas, then later spun in centrifuges to reach the levels needed. However, each tonne of natural uranium, if obtained by a group with the technological means and resources, can be refined to 5.6kg (12lbs) of weapons-grade material over time, experts say. That made finding the missing metal important for nonproliferation experts. The discovery that the uranium had gone missing was the result of an inspection originally planned for last year that “had to be postponed because of the security situation in the region” and was finally carried out on Tuesday, according to a confidential statement from Grossi. He said not knowing the location of the material could present a radiological risk and concerns over nuclear security. In 2003, Libya, under its then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, renounced its nuclear weapons programme, which had obtained centrifuges that could enrich uranium as well as design information for a nuclear bomb, although it made little progress towards a bomb. The African country has been mired in a political crisis since Gaddafi’s fall in 2011, with myriad militias forming opposing alliances backed by foreign powers. Libya remains split between a nominally interim government in the capital, Tripoli, in the west and another in the east backed by the military strongman Khalifa Haftar.

The dam is located upstream of the city of Kherson on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine. Russia controls the territory on the left bank of the river. The right bank is held by Ukraine. In the early hours of 6 June, the dam collapsed. Before its collapse, the 30-metre-high, 2km-long dam had a road running along its top. It powered the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, a major energy producer, and held back a reservoir containing 18 cubic km of water that supplied communities and agriculture and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control. How serious is the damage and the flooding? Before-and-after satellite images show the extent of the damage to the dam and the adjacent Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which were largely swept away. The collapse sent water cascading downstream, flooding 230 sq miles of territory, according to Ukrainian authorities. This map shows the extent of the flooding as of 7 June. The geography around the river means Russian-controlled areas to the south have been more badly hit. North of Kherson city, the land rises to a plain overlooking the river. To the south is a wide delta with marshes, low-lying islands and flat, sandy levels. Video images from the city of Russian-controlled Nova Kakhovka showed flood waters in the main square rising around the municipal building on 6 June. This footage shows flooding in Korsunka, Dnipriany and Nova Kakhovka – the three settlements immediately downstream of the dam on the Russian-controlled left bank of the river. These before-and-after satellite images show the impact of the flooding on the settlements of Krynky and Oleshky. These images show the flooding of a granary in Nova Kakhovka. What has the humanitarian impact been? At least five people have reportedly died as a result of the floods, a number that is expected to increase. Emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Kherson said on 8 June that up to 14,000 homes had been flooded. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes. Some of those who haven’t left have become stranded on rooftops as the water levels have risen. This drone footage shows water being delivered by air to a family trapped in their house in Oleshky. They were later rescued. Who was responsible? Ukraine has blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion, of blowing it up in an attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Kremlin says Kyiv sabotaged the dam to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. Ukraine’s allies in the west have not directly apportioned blame to Russia, but they have questioned why Kyiv would want to destroy the dam. Engineering experts have said the collapse was most likely caused by a deliberate explosion inside the dam. It is possible that the collapse was made more impactful by the fact that Russia had deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it. How will it affect Ukraine’s counteroffensive? The delta area had been seen as vulnerable for Russian forces in part because of its low elevation. The flooding has put paid – for now at least – to any potential Ukrainian attempt to cross the Dnipro River around Kherson/Nova Kakhovka by widening the barrier separating the two forces. The loss of the road across the top of the dam also deprives Ukraine of a potential line of attack across the river, leaving only the Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson city as a paved river crossing. The flooding may also allow Russian reserves in the south to block any move on Melitopol. And it could free up troop reserves concentrated in the south, allowing them to be directed elsewhere. What is the impact on farming and the environment? In the hours after the collapse, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “a global ecological disaster” was playing out. On 8 June Zelenskiy himself said that 50,000 hectares of forest had been flooded, and that 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. This footage from upstream shows dead and dying fish on the drained bottom of the Nova Kakhovka reservoir on 7 June. There are fears that the depleted reservoir will leave three critical regions in Ukraine’s “bread basket” without a key water supply. A series of canals run from the reservoir, all of which help irrigate swaths of agricultural land. The most significant of these canals are the North Crimean canal, which supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea, and the Kakhovsky canal, which irrigates most of the Kherson region’s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia. Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir taken before the dam collapse shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. Ukraine has warned that agricultural land in these regions could be so heavily affected that they could turn into “deserts”. What is the impact on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? The cooling systems for Europe’s largest nuclear plant are supplied with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. If the dam falls below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there are alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T23:29:20Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy says dam attack an ‘environmental bomb of mass destruction’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-dam-near-kherson-blown-up-by-russian-forces-ukrainian-military-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The Kyiv Independent reports that Ukraine will allocate US$40.6 million for the construction of new water mains: Russian forces repeatedly fired at an ammonia pipeline in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, a local governor said on Tuesday, a conduit potentially crucial for the extension of a deal allowing the safe export of grains and fertilisers from Black Sea ports. Reuters report that the ammonia pipeline, the world’s longest, stretches about 2,470 kilometres (1,534 miles) from Russia’s Togliatti on the Volga River to three Black Sea ports. It has been shut down since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There was no recorded leakage from the late Tuesday shelling that hit the pipeline near the village of Masiutivka and an overnight shelling near the village of Zapadne, said Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. “There is no threat to people’s lives and health,” Sinehubov said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted.Sunak said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. US military chief Milley said Ukraine is “well prepared” for a counteroffensive. The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he “does not understand” how there are any doubts that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. George Barros, an analyst at the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, has shared these images showing the extent of the flooding southeast of Kherson city: The Associated Press has this sketch from the evacuations: As shelling from Russia’s war on Ukraine echoed overhead, dozens of evacuees on an island in the Dnipro River scurried on to the tops of military trucks or into rafts to flee rising flood waters caused by the breach of a dam upstream. The unnerving bark of dogs left behind further soured the mood of those ferried to safety. A woman in one raft clutched the head of her despondent daughter. A stalled military truck stuck in swelling waters raised the panic level as Red Cross teams tried to manage an orderly evacuation. Nobody knew just how high the waters rushing through a gaping hole in the Kakhovka dam would rise, or whether people or pets would escape alive. The scrambled evacuation by boat and military truck from an island neighbourhood off the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson downstream on Tuesday testified to the latest human chaos caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities accused Russian forces of purposely destroying the dam. Russian authorities blamed recent Ukrainian military strikes. “The Russians have hit the dam, and didn’t think of consequences,” said Oleksandr Sokeryn, who fled his house with his family after it was completely flooded. “They should not be forgiven.” Officials on both sides said the massive dam breach had caused no civilian casualties, and the hurried escape was aimed to keep it that way. Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted. The British PM said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. Here are some recent photos of residents from the areas affected by flooding: The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam has been widely condemned as a possible war crime. John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the national security council, said the US was assessing whether it a war crime Multiple Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that if Russia had attacked the dam it would be a war crime under the terms of the Geneva conventions. The conventions mention dams, which are listed under “works containing dangerous forces”: Article 56 – Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces 1. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Hi, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our coverage of the war in Ukraine and the attack on Nova Kakhovka dam. I’ll be with you for the next while. If you see news you think we may have missed, have questions, or live near Nova Kakhovka dam get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Russia’s UN envoy was accused of floundering in a mud of lies when he claimed at an emergency session of the UN security council that Ukraine was guilty of a extremely dangerous strategy and a war crime by destroying Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukraine envoy to the UN, said it was typical of Russians to blame the victim for its own crimes, noting that Russia has controlled the dam for more than a year and it would have been physically impossible to blow it up by shelling. He said the dam was mined by the Russian occupiers who blew it up and accused Russia of floundering in a mud of lies. Kyslytsya also said the flooding caused by the explosion was going to be far worse on the Ukrainian occupied side of the Dnipro river. “By resorting to scorched earth tactics, or in this case to flooded Earth tactics, the Russian occupiers have effectively recognised that the captured territory does not belong to them, and they are not able to hold these lands,” he said. Neither French US or British representatives at the UN directly claimed there was evidence of Russian responsibility, but called for an investigation and insisted their support was unwavering to Ukraine. The United States said it was “not certain” who was to blame for a burst dam in Ukraine, but it would not make sense for Ukraine to have done this to its own people and territory, while Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the disaster. The 15-member UN security council met on Tuesday at the request of both Russia and Ukraine after a torrent of water burst through a massive dam on the Dnipro River, which separates the opposing forces in southern Ukraine. When asked if the United States knew who was responsible, deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told reporters ahead of the council meeting: “We’re not certain at all, we hope to have more information in the coming days.” “But, I mean, come on … why would Ukraine do this to its own territory and people, flood its land, force tens of thousands of people to leave their homes – it doesn’t make sense,” Wood said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said earlier on Tuesday that it did not have any independent information on how the dam burst, but described it as “another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. The head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev will hold in Minsk security talks with his Belarusian counterpart this week as well as the security heads of several other countries in the region, Russia’s news agencies reported. Patrushev is to hold talks with the head of Belarus security Alexander Wolfovich on Wednesday and the heads of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), on Thursday, TASS reported. The CSTO is an intergovernmental military alliance consisting of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Asked whether the subject would be raised with the US President Joe Biden at their meeting on Thursday, Rishi Sunak added: “Of course I’ll be discussing Ukraine with President Biden, generally, but the immediate response is humanitarian. “So we had already put resources and funding in place to support both the UN and the Red Cross to respond to situations like this. “And they are now being able to divert those resources to particularly help the humanitarian response and the evacuation in this area as a result of what’s happened. “So we were already thinking ahead about situations like this, and I’m pleased that the UK is continuing to support Ukraine in lots of different ways.” Rishi Sunak said the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine would mark a “new low” in the conflict if Russian forces were found to be responsible. The UK’s prime minister said the immediate priority was the humanitarian response to the catastrophe, which has flooded villages, endangered vital crops and threatened drinking water supplies. Sunak, speaking to reporters as he travelled to Washington for talks with US President Joe Biden, said if it was an intentional act to blow up the dam it would be “the largest attack on civilian infrastructure” since the start of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said attacks on civilian infrastructure were “appalling and wrong”. Sunak said: “Our military and intelligence agencies are currently looking at it, so it’s too soon to pre-empt that and make a definitive judgment. “But what I can say is if it is intentional, it would represent, I think, the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war, and just would demonstrate the new lows that we would have seen from Russian aggression. “Attacks on civilian infrastructure are appalling and wrong. We’ve seen previous instances of that in this conflict so far, but it’s too early to say definitively.” In his nightly address, president Zelensky also said Ukrainian prosecutors had already approached prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague “to involve international justice in the investigation of the destruction of the dam”. And for the second day running, Zelenskiy singled out military units fighting in and near the long-besieged eastern city of Bakhmut while giving no details of the clashes, Reuters reports. Here are some more images sent to us on the news wires on Tuesday afternoon showing the aftermath of the explosion and collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts, Reuters reports. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. He said that he destruction of the dam would “not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still liberate all our land. Only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from the Russian occupiers will guarantee that there will be no more such terrorist attacks.” The government of Spain has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in a statement issued Tuesday night, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent Sam Jones reports. The statement stops short of blaming Russia for the incident, but makes clear Spain believes a crime has taken place: This act, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, affects the lives and safety of thousands of people in the region and represents a huge environmental harm. Here’s our sketch from the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh in Kherson, following the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam: On what should have been a Kherson street corner, Larysa Musian, a hydrologist, sits and watches the flood waters rising. The Dnipro River used to be 300-400 metres away, but after the dam at Nova Kakhovka was breached at 2.50am on Tuesday, it has burst into the city, flooding the first two or three blocks of the lowest lying quarter. Every half hour, Musian rises from her stool, carrying a square charcoal grey ruler. The water, she says, is rising “6 to 8cm every half hour” and is 3 metres above where it was before the dam burst. She phones through her figures to colleagues in the regional monitoring centre in nearby Mykolaiv. “When it goes back to 5cm an hour, and then four, we can start saying it has stabilised,” Musian continues, as she returns to her perch. But it is not clear when that will happen, not least because “we cannot say for sure how much water passed the dam, because it was controlled by the Russians”. For now, the river waters continue to rise visibly, in line it seems with Musian’s calculations, lapping farther up the dry streets, the latest avoidable tragedy to hit a city already blighted heavily by the 15-month war. As a scientist, what does she think of who did this? “It’s inhumane and dumb,” she says, and the culprits were “Russians who did this deliberately; I’m not thinking it was an accident.” Not everybody wanted to speak to the Guardian, but those who did knew who to blame – “Muscovites”, another resident said. The nearest Russian positions are only 2.5km away, and since Ukraine managed to liberate Kherson in November, the invaders have responded with incessant and at times deadly shelling. The low-lying area was already largely deserted and war damage is all too visible. Now it is being flooded in smelly, dirty, oil-coated river water. Read the full story: The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Milley was speaking with the Associated Press at the American Cemetery in Normandy, France, final resting place of almost 9,400 troops who died 79 years ago during the allied D-Day invasion on 6 June, 1944. He said it was up to Ukraine to announce whether its counteroffensive campaign has formally begun, but he said Ukrainian troops are ready for the fight: There’s activity throughout Russian-occupied Ukraine and fighting has picked up. It’s our estimation that the Ukrainian military is well prepared for whatever they do. They choose to fight in the offensive fight or in the defense, they’re well-prepared. As time goes on, he says, the fighting will vary: Like the battle of Normandy or any other major battle, warfare is a give and take. There will be days you see a lot of activity and there will be days you may see very little activity. There will be offensive actions and defense actions. So this will be a back-and-forth fight for a considerable length of time. You can read Milley’s D-Day anniversary interview with the AP here. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov is warning, again, of an “escalation” in the war in Ukraine if western allies provide F-16 fighter jets for use in the conflict. “We must keep in mind that one of the modifications of the F-16 can ‘accommodate’ nuclear weapons,” he said Tuesday in a speech at a military base in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, according to Reuters. “If they do not understand this, then they are worthless as military strategists and planners.” A number of nations, including the UK, have said in recent weeks that they want to help procure the fighter jets for Ukraine. Joe Biden has not committed to supplying aircraft, but has said the US will back an international effort to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them before doing so. John Kirby, White House coordinator of strategic communications for the National Security Council, spoke to reporters about F-16s on Tuesday: The purpose of providing advanced fighter aircraft is to help Ukraine defend itself defend its airspace and its territorial integrity, period. To Lavrov, he added: If you’re worried about Ukrainian military capabilities, then you should take your troops and leave Ukraine.

There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details,” he said. Here’s what you need to know about the dam: John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, has just spoken at the White House, and says the US is “assessing” the attack on the Nova Kakhovk dam. He was asked if the Biden administration considers it a war crime: I don’t have a determination on that to speak to today. I would just say we’re still trying to assess what happened here, but the Russians had illegally taken over that dam in the reservoir many months ago, and they were occupying it when this explosion happened. It’s very clear that the deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war, and in the additional protocol to the Geneva Convention that the Russians have themselves signed, destruction of civilian infrastructure, such as dams, are clearly articulated in their violations of that code. But again, we haven’t made a decision. We’re still talking to the Ukrainians. Kirby is also promising that more support for Ukraine will be coming in short order as a potential “repercussion” of the attack: I guarantee you, you’re gonna see additional security assistance packages in coming days and weeks. We’re going to continue to make sure that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield, as President Biden has said. If Russia is concerned about Ukrainian military capabilities, best thing that they can do would be to leave Ukraine. We have made our concerns about strikes inside Russia very clear to Ukrainian officials. They’ve acknowledged that and they have assured us that they won’t use US-made equipment to strike inside Russia. We don’t want to see the war escalate and, and there’s no apologies for that. But I won’t go into detail about the private discussions that we’re having with with Ukrainians. Reuters reports that Russia’s foreign ministry said it summoned Belgium’s ambassador on Tuesday to protest what it said was the use of “Belgian weapons” by pro-Ukraine militants that attacked Russian territory last month. This claim has not been independently verified. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said “35 to 70 towns will be flooded” along the Dnipro River after the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam. He also said there could be problems accessing clean drinking water while speaking at a briefing on Tuesday. “There will be big problems with drinking water even where there is no flooding. In the whole region,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Andrei Alexeyenko, chairman of the Russian-appointed government of Ukraine’s Kherson province, said the small town of Oleshky, which lies on the southern bank of the Dnipro River, was almost completely flooded. On Telegram, Alexeyenko posted videos showing one car standing in flood water up to the window and a lorry driving along a highway in water at least a foot deep. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU commission, said on Twitter that Russia would have to “pay for the war crimes committed in Ukraine”. She called the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam an “outrageous attack on civilian infrastructure [that] puts at risk thousands of people in the Kherson region.” She also confirmed that the EU has engaged its civil protection mechanism, which would “rapidly deliver” dirt water pumps, fire hoses, mobile water purification stations and boats to those affected by the dam explosion. NBC News reports that the US government has intelligence that indicates Russia is behind the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam, according to two US officials and one western official. President Joe Biden’s administration was working to declassify some of the intelligence and share it as early as Tuesday afternoon. The western official said the collapse appears likely to make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to conduct a river crossing. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, writes about the long-term impacts of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse The people living along Ukraine’s lower Dnipro river must contend with the immediate consequences of the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and flee for safety with whatever they can salvage, but the wider impact could make itself felt for generations. Downstream, the flood waters will subside somewhat as the surge reaches the Black Sea, but many of the villages and towns along the course of the Dnipro may not be habitable again unless and until a new dam is built. Thousands of homes and livelihoods have been swept away, along with countless domesticated and wild animals. The ecological trauma of such an inundation of water and silt has changed the landscape in an instant, wiping away islands and wetlands. It could take years if not decades for the fauna and flora to bounce back. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it the “largest human-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. It is the country’s misfortune to have also been the site of the Chornobyl disaster in 1986, arguably the last calamity on such a scale. Read more: Devastation from Kakhovka dam collapse could take decades to heal Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said he “did not understand” how there could be any doubt about whether Russian forces blew up the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement given to the Guardian, the senior aide said the dam could not have been destroyed through shelling or “any other external influence” - while another adviser to the president said the attack amounted to a war crime. In the statement, Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said: “At 2:50am this morning, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric Station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within. “We know that Russian troops had mined the hydroelectric Station in the early days of the full-scale invasion, so the pre-meditated blast is the only plausible explanation. Any alternative theories are nothing less than false Russian propaganda narratives.” Dasha Zarivna, a senior adviser in the Ukrainian presidential office, who was born and raised in Kherson, said: “The dam bombing is another unprecedented Russian war crime against Ukraine, which will have catastrophic consequences both for its population and other countries. These include environmental and economic consequences, a great risk from radiation and further serious disruption to food security. “Last October, President Zelenskiy said: ‘All the world leaders should let Russia understand that a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station will be equated to the use of weapons of mass destruction’. Now it has happened. World leaders must recognise the equivalence, and now must act decisively. It is essential to isolate the terrorist state as completely as possible. Any economic ties with Russia outside of humanitarian activities should be regarded as complicity in its war crimes.” The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, calls the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam a consequence of the Russian invasion, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters, Guterres said “one thing is clear, this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” “Attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure must stop. We must act to ensure accountability and respect for international humanitarian law,” he continued. Guterres added that it was a “monumental humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe.” “At least 16,000 people have already lost their homes – with safe and clean drinking water supplies at risk for many thousands more,” he said. He added that the UN was coordinating with the Ukrainian government to send support including drinking water and water purification tablets. Ukraine and Russia have both asked the UN security council to meet to discuss the incident. Here are some images of nearby residents wading through flood water after the Nova Kakhovka dam explosion. Reuters reports that Finland will expel nine diplomats working at the Russian embassy in Helsinki, accusing them of working on intelligence missions. “Their actions are contrary to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,” the president’s office said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that it would inform the Russian ambassador of the expulsions. The decision was made at a meeting between Finnish president Sauli Niinisto and the country’s ministerial committee on foreign and security policy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has blamed Russia for the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Speaking a townhall organised by broadcaster RTL, Scholz said: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Scholz also said that he intends to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, again, but added he had not done so for a long time and now was not the right time. Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP and leader of the liberal Holos party, said Ukraine was “one step away from a nuclear tragedy” after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. When asked about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station during an interview with GB News, Rudik said: “President Zelenskiy has warned the world in October last year that Russians have mined the Kakhovka power plant dam and that we were one step away from from the real tragedy. Right now, it happened. “For the last year we have been saying to the world the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is critical and again we are one step away from a nuclear tragedy. “If Russians are good at anything, they’re good at committing false flag operations. So let’s do possible and impossible things to make sure that we secure the station.” She added: “As of right now, the situation is not dangerous but we cannot guarantee that that will not change and we are calling for international support, for the UN to make sure that we install international inspectors at the nuclear plant because we do not know what’s going to happen there.” There has been some reaction to the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse on the other side of the Atlantic to Europe. Reuters reports that a Biden administration official said the US was “very concerned” after the Russian-controlled dam burst, and was trying to find out more about the potential impact. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the destruction “was another example of the horrific consequences of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine”. Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said the disaster was “absolutely devastating for lives and livelihoods across the region”. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for the collapse of the dam. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Tuesday of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as part of a plan to redeploy units from the nearby Kherson region for operations against Russian forces. Reuters reports that a Russian defence ministry statement signed by Shoigu said the dam breach and resultant flooding were designed to prevent Russia from attacking near Kherson, while allowing Ukraine to “transfer units and equipment from the Kherson front to the area of offensive operations”. The widening of the Dnipro River by the flood water from the destroyed dam is likely to make it harder for Ukrainian troops to form a bridgehead and oust Russian troops from the left bank of the river and the southern portion of the Kherson oblast that Russia occupies and has claimed to annex. [See Dan Sabbagh’s analysis of potential military impact of the dam’s destruction at 10.27 BST] Here are some images we have been sent over the news wires of Russians from the Shebekinsky district in Belgorod region receiving humanitarian aid after being evacuated. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as a distraction from ongoing border skirmishes in Russia’s Belgorod region, and suggested it will have a negative impact on Russia’s own ability to hold on to territory it occupies in Kherson region. On Telegram, Hanna Maliar posted: The Russian terrorist army has committed another crime that is capable of causing a serious ecological and humanitarian catastrophe. The purposeful undermining of the dam was carried out by the Russian occupiers in order to stop the process of de-occupation by the defence forces of Ukraine and shift the vector of public attention from the events taking place in the Belgorod region. Instead, the Russian occupiers had the opposite effect. Currently, civilians in the temporarily occupied settlements of Kherson region and Crimea are in a critical situation, as the destruction of the dam deprived them of fresh water. In addition, positions of Russian military units were flooded, which could lead to large-scale washing of Russian minefields and their detonation in a chaotic manner. Earlier, the governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, issued a denial in a video message that anti-Kremlin forces were in the settlement of Novaya Tavolzhanka, saying “there are many insinuations” but “today there is no enemy in the Belgorod region. People ask a lot about Novaya Tavolzhanka. There is no enemy on the territory of Novaya Tavolzhanka.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to say he met the pope’s peace envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi in Kyiv. Ukraine’s president wrote: We discussed the situation in Ukraine and humanitarian cooperation in the framework of the Ukrainian peace formula. Only united efforts, diplomatic isolation and pressure on Russia can influence the aggressor and bring a just peace to the Ukrainian land. I call on the Holy See to contribute to the implementation of the Ukrainian peace plan. Ukraine welcomes the readiness of other states and partners to find ways to peace, but since the war is on our territory, the algorithm for achieving peace can be Ukrainian only. Ukraine’s 10-point peace formula demands the withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations and prosecutions for Russia’s war leadership. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has claimed that a Ukrainian counteroffensive has been repulsed for three days by Russian forces who have inflicted more than 1,500 casualties in the process. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports: According to him, on 4 June, the armed forces of Ukraine, with the help of two brigades, tried to attack in five directions, they did not achieve success and lost 300 soldiers. On 5 June, the Kyiv regime attempted an offensive in seven directions with the forces of five brigades, was stopped and suffered significant losses, the minister said. According to him, during the attempted offensive on 5 June, Ukraine’s losses amounted to over 1,600 servicemen. The claims have not been independently verified. The president of Energoatom, Ukraine’s state energy firm, has reiterated that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the full-scale invasion. On Telegram, Petro Kotin is quoted as saying: Both in the pond itself at the ZNPP and in the so-called bowls of the basins … the normal water level is maintained, which was in them before the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam was blown up. He said that if the water level did fall, there were ways of topping it up. He was quoted as saying: Since September 2022, the power units of the ZNPP have not been operating, therefore active evaporation of water from the cooling pond does not occur, and there has been no need to feed it yet. And even if there will be no water in the Kakhovsky reservoir at all, the project provides measures to replenish it. One of the latter is the use of underground water from wells at the ZNPP site. Oleksandr Syenkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, has posted to say that flooding is not happening in his city, which sits on the Pivdennyi Buh River. The Pivdennyi Buh opens out into the Dnipro delta, where flood water from the Nova Kakhovka dam failure will be heading. He posted to Telegram to say: As of 2pm, the water level in the Mykolaiv area rose by 23cm. The good news: within an hour, that is, until 3pm, there were no changes. We will continue to monitor the situation. There is currently no threat of flooding. An air alert has been declared in Dnipropetrovsk region. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires of people, and their pets, being evacuated from Kherson. Oleksiy Arestovych, a former adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had no doubts that Russia was behind the dam explosion. Arestovych, a key Zelenskiy aide during the first year of the war, resigned from his official post in January after saying a Russian missile that killed dozens had in fact been shot down by Ukrainian air defence. Speaking on the sidelines of a forum of Russian opposition politicians in Brussels, he said: I’m 110% sure it was the Russians, you can tell even by the chronology of their announcements. At 6am their military bloggers and their Kherson ‘governor’ were saying ‘we’ve blown it up and we’ll flood their soldiers on the islands in the Dnipro’ and then there was a sudden change of message. There could be two reasons why they did it. One is simply to sabotage [our military’s] capability to cross the Dnipro. The second reason would be to show the world the possible consequences of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, to say ‘hold back the Ukrainians’ and show how bad the consequences could be. It fits very well with recent statements from China, from [Hungarian prime minister Viktor] Orbán, [Putin’s press secretary Dmitry] Peskov, that we are ready for a peaceful resolution. They are very scared of the counteroffensive. For now we don’t have enough facts to say which of the two reasons is the primary one. Pjotr Sauer has spoken to people living in Nova Kakhovka about the dam explosion: Two residents living in Nova Kakhovka, the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city where a dam was blown up overnight, told the Guardian that they heard loud explosions at about 2am. “I was woken up by a very loud noise,” said Tatyana, who declined to give her full name. She said she heard a noise that sounded like water flowing shortly after the initial blast. Yelena, another resident in the city, said she was woken up by what she thought was an explosion at about 2am. “We have become used to loud bangs, so I did not think it was anything serious,” she said. “It is hard to know for sure where the blast came from.” Vladimir Leontiev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, said the town had been “completely flooded” hours after the accident. Videos on social media showed swans swimming through the flooded central square of the city. Leontiev told a Russian-state news channel that the water in the town rose to over 36 feet, and some people along the riverbank were being evacuated. Some locals on the ground described a chaotic scene. “Everyone is left to fend for themselves, there is no organised evacuation,” said Gleb, who was looking for ways to leave the city. Russia’s vocal military bloggers and other war hawks have been spinning the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovska as either a Ukrainian diversion or a tactic meant to sweep away Russian defences on the left bank of the Dnipro River before their counteroffensive. Igor Girkin, a former leader of Russian proxy forces in east Ukraine, wrote on his popular Telegram blog that the dam’s failure could “wash away our forces on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro below [Nova Kakhovka]. That would also ‘wash away’ all of our defensive fortifications, all the minefields, all the warehouses with ammunition would be flooded, it would fully or partially destroy all the property that they didn’t manage to pack up and ship away (and that would be quite a bit, unfortunately).” Although they often come into conflict with the military, most seem to have endorsed the Kremlin line of “deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side”, as claimed by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. But others have deviated from the party line. In a video, Yegor Guzenko, a popular commentator who has fought in the war, smiled broadly as he said he had predicted many times before that the dam would eventually become a target. “I won’t say who blew it up,” he said. “But from a tactical point of view, the [Ukrainians] can forget about the offensive in the Kherson direction. “If the evacuation [of Russian military personnel] goes well and without losses then we can blow up all the fucking dams on the Dnipro River if it fucking suits us.” Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, and Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, describe the devastation unleashed by the collapse of Nova Kakhovka dam. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the water from the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while countless pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic impact on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream. Read more here: Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, claims that Russia is shelling areas in southern Kherson where people are being evacuated, leaving two police officers wounded. “The Russian military continue to shell territory where evacuation measures are being carried out. An hour ago, two police officers were wounded in the area. Shelling continues at the moment,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. European leaders must not be naive to the divisions Russian propaganda can cause in communities hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees, a special adviser to the EU has said. Unveiling a report on how Ukrainians fleeing the war have fared in the EU, Lodewijk Asscher said that “solidarity is alive and kicking” but added that societies need to be on guard against “solidarity fatigue”, particularly towards more vulnerable refugees. Around 4 million refugees remain in the EU, down from a peak of 16 million, with 11 million returning to Ukraine and 1 million moving to other countries, mainly Canada and the US, says the report, titled Integration of People Fleeing Ukraine in the EU. Of the 3.8 million seeking protection under special EU laws, more than half were hosted by Germany and Poland, which accounted for 2 million refugees. The highest number per capita of domestic population are being hosted by Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Russia says it has launched a criminal investigation into the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Tuesday that it had launched a criminal investigation into the overnight destruction of the hydroelectric dam which sits in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Kherson region. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has called for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure” on the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement, the ministry also called for the UN atomic agency’s board of governors to discuss the incident and demanded new sanctions on Russia from the G7 and the EU, with a particular focus on the Russian missile industry and nuclear sector. The ministry also called on the EU to engage its the civil protection mechanism which can deliver aid to those in need following a natural or human-made disaster. The EU has condemned the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam, calling it a “horrific and barbaric” escalation of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Peter Stano, the European Commission’s spokesperson, said: ”“This is a new sign of escalation, bringing the horrific and barbaric nature of Russian aggression against Ukraine to unprecedented levels.” Vladimir Leontyev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, called the breach of the dam in the city a “terrorist act” and blamed Ukraine, Reuters reports. Speaking to Russian state television, Leontyev said: “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of sabotaging the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, which sits in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, to distract attention from a supposedly “faltering” counteroffensive against Russian forces, Reuters reports. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. He said the destruction of the dam was intended to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir through the North Crimean Canal, and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. “Apparently, this sabotage is also connected with the fact that having started large-scale offensive actions two days ago, now the Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals – these offensive actions are faltering.” Asked about Ukrainian allegations that Russia had destroyed the dam, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” Peskov said the sabotage could “potentially have very serious consequences for several tens of thousands of residents of the region”. Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam a war crime. She said on Twitter that the “terrorist state Russia has now turned water into a weapon”. “Destroying [Nova Kakhovka] dam is a war crime affecting countless civilians and bringing ecocide and mass destruction,” she said. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam “a fundamentally new stage of Russian aggression”. He said on Twitter that Russia had openly declared “its true goal – the destruction of Ukraine, killing Ukrainians, destroying the economy and life support structures.” The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Ukrahydroenergo said the hydoelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken by bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and to other Ukrainian cities including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. Occupying Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Vladimir Leontyev told the Tass news agency it was a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them”. Leontyev said part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons, and about 300 houses had been evacuated. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, told the broadcaster Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” Here is an updated report from our video team on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The chief of the UN’s atomic agency, Rafael Grossi, has issued a statement about the Nova Kakhovka dam destruction and its potential impact on nuclear safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). He said a planned visit to the plant would go ahead next week, and called on both sides in the conflict to do nothing to further endanger safety at the plant, drawing particular attention to the on-site cooling pond. The IAEA’s director general said: The IAEA staff on the site have been informed that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam is currently leading to about 5cm/hour reduction in the height of the reservoir. The main line of cooling water is fed from the reservoir and pumped up through channels near the thermal power plant to the site. It is estimated that the water through this route should last for a few days. Water in the reservoir was at around 16.4 metres at 8am. If it drops below 12.7 metres then it can no longer be pumped. The ZNPP is making all efforts to pump as much water into its cooling channels and related systems as possible. In addition, non-essential consumers of water are being stopped at ZNPP to reduce the consumption of water. ZNPP management is discussing further measures to be implemented. There are a number of alternative sources of water. A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir. As the reactors have been shut down for many months, it is estimated that this pond will be sufficient to provide water for cooling for some months. The agency will confirm this very shortly. It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that. My trip to ZNPP next week was planned and now it is essential. I will go. The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine will not prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing, Reuters reports a senior Ukrainian commander said on Tuesday. “As for preventing our offensive actions, the military command has taken into full account such treacherous enemy actions, and it should not prevent our advance in those directions where there may be spillage of water,” Serhiy Naev, commander of the joint forces of the armed forces of Ukraine, was quoted as saying by the state news agency Ukrinform. While attention has understandably focused on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, clear-up operations have also been carried out in Kharkiv after a Russian strike. Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, offers this analysis of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam: Although it remains not yet confirmed exactly how the dam was blown, it is the Russian military who, cynically, would probably think they have the most to gain. Ukraine will have to deal with a destroyed dam plus the long-term environmental and humanitarian consequences. Experts fear it will wipe out islands in the delta and low-lying settlements, mostly on the southern bank. There are about 16,000 people estimated to be in the critical zone on the Ukrainian side of the river. Such predictable impacts mean it is likely to be a war crime, as defined in the Geneva conventions, if its breach causes “release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses” to civilians. If it is the case, as initially reported, that water levels have been built up to a 30-year high in recent weeks, that could suggest a degree of forethought that would only bolster a future legal case. The obvious military point is that Russia feared an amphibious attack across the Dnipro delta. Some of Ukraine’s armed forces have been receiving marine training from the UK, suggesting that, at the very least, Kyiv wanted to keep the option open of trying what would have been a relative risky attack that, if successful, could have opened up the option of a more direct strike towards Crimea – or diverting Russian forces away from the southern front further east in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Russian defensive positions downstream, as mapped from satellite imagery, have already been concentrated on higher ground. The breach of the dam is an uncertain event, and it will take some days before it is clear where the new river line will be – and whether the fortifications are in appropriate positions. Widening the Dnipro River from hundreds of metres to several kilometres makes the task of crossing in strength all the harder at the delta. Russia still has its air force available to make a river crossing difficult, and as the battle for Kherson in November showed, it is difficult to keep a bridgehead across the country’s central river supplied. However, it is also the case that the river is likely to narrow upstream, south of Zaporizhzhia. That may also create some military opportunities for Kyiv. What is certain is that as with the impact on civilians and the environment, all the consequences are some way from being played out. Russia blew up the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine to prevent Ukrainian forces from crossing the Dnipro River, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command said on Tuesday. “This is a hysterical reaction,” Natalia Humeniuk told an online briefing, Reuters reports. “They were aware that the movement of the defence forces would take place, and in this way tried to influence the defence forces so that the crossing of the [river], which they feared, would not happen.” There are limited crossing points over the river. Ukraine holds the right bank, to the north, while Russia continues to occupy the left bank and the south of Kherson oblast. A state of emergency has been declared by local Moscow-backed authorities in the Nova Kakhovka district of the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Kherson region after the dam breach, Reuters reports, citing Tass. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has criticised the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, tweeting: The destruction of the Kakhovka dam puts thousands of civilians in danger, leaving many with no homes and in dire humanitarian need. Civilians and civilian infrastructure are not a target. Its social media team are maybe not entirely in lockstep with that of its parent organisation UN, which has run into vocal social media criticism for earlier using Twitter to promote today as “Russian Language Day”. The Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko was among those to reply to the tweet, asking: “Do you want to write anything about the explosion of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station? Or will you celebrate the Russian language day?” The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is in Ukraine, where he has been visiting the Halo Trust in the Kyiv region, an NGO that works in demining. Our community team are asking for your witness reports of the aftermath of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam if you live in the region. Details of how to contact them can be found here: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted details from the emergency national council meeting (NSDC) this morning to respond to the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Ukraine’s president posted to Telegram to say: I held an urgent meeting of the national security council. Overnight [at] 02.50am, Russian terrorists carried out an internal detonation of the structures of the Kakhovskaya HPP [hydroelectric power plant]. About 80 settlements are in the flooding zone. It was ordered to carry out evacuation from risk areas and to provide drinking water to all cities and villages that were supplied with water from the Kakhovsky reservoir. We do everything to save people. All services, military, government, are involved. At the NSDC meeting, a set of international and security measures was agreed upon to hold Russia accountable for this terrorist attack. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and offered Moldova’s support. She tweeted: I strongly condemn the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam this morning. Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructure amounts to war crimes. President Zelenskiy, we stand ready to provide assistance in response to the floods and support efforts to mitigate the impact. The Russian military is shelling Kherson with artillery, while the population is being evacuated in the city, the ministry of internal affairs reported. Two police officers received shrapnel wounds, Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image that has come through of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Video is circulating on social media that appears to show the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant has been completely submerged by rising waters of the Dnipro River. The Guardian has not independently verified the video. The Telegram channel of Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying some quotes from the Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo. It reports: Large-scale evacuation of people will not be required in the Kherson region after the destruction of the structures of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, said Saldo. The destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station led to the flow of a large, but not critical amount of water along the [Dnipro] River, this will not prevent the Russian forces from protecting the left bank, Saldo noted. It also quotes the Russian-imposed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, claiming: The situation at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station is a consequence of Ukrainian armed forces strikes on the station, which have continued daily since the summer of 2022, the authorities said. The Kakhovka HPP continues to collapse, water is discharged uncontrollably, the head of Nova Kakhovka said. Shebekino district in Russia’s Belgorod region is being shelled, local authorities told residents on Tuesday. Reuters reports that in messages via social media, residents were warned to take cover in cellars. The destruction of a dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine is an attempt by Moscow to “raise the stakes” in its full-scale invasion and stoke fears of a nuclear catastrophe, a senior Ukrainian official said on Tuesday. “Today, the world must understand that this is an attempt by terrorists to raise the stakes and scare everyone with a possible nuclear disaster,” Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration, wrote on Telegram, Reuters reports. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 120 miles downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement saying the situation at the plant was under control, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said its experts at the site were monitoring the situation and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk”. But there are long-term concerns over safety and the possibility of the plant operating again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C, so that it will be easier to restart when conditions allowed, and to supply hot water to the neighbouring town of Enerhodar. Oleksiy, who left after the Russians occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should now be shut down, and that the plant had sufficient resources for now to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was current at 16.6 metres, “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP where water can be maintained above the reservoir level and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if the ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is senior research associate at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir that had been created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. Budjeryn had another sobering thought about the implications. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.” Tass reports that the Russian-imposed head of the settlement of Nova Kakhovka says the water has risen by 10 metres. Here is some of the earlier video footage of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, carries this latest report on the consequences of the damaged to the Nova Kakhovka dam: Due to the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP, there is a threat of flooding up to 80 settlements, prime minister [Denys] Shmyhal said. As of now, more than 10 settlements have been completely or partially flooded, reported the Kherson regional authority. About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region. Local authorities are evacuating residents from potential flood zones. At 12pm an evacuation train will leave Kherson for Mykolaiv. Suspilne also provided this graphic showing the likely affected settlements. Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, has issued a strong statement after the destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant, which Ukrhydroenergo claims was destroyed by an explosion from inside the turbine hall. Kostin tweeted: Russia can only destroy and kill. And will stop at nothing. Blowing up the Kakhovskaya HPP is another proof of this and an international crime. Today, the cornered occupiers are killing and leaving thousands of people homeless, whom they wanted to “integrate into the Russian Federation” just yesterday. Cannibalistic “scorched earth” tactics worthy of Hitler. Anyone who still thinks that it is possible to talk about something with an aggressor should remember the streams of dirty water that wash away the homes of people who were sleeping peacefully. The end of the criminal Russian regime can only be one – defeat and a tribunal. The Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied settlement of Nova Kakhovk near the damaged dam has blamed Ukraine for the incident. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carrying quotes from Vladimir Leontyev for Russia’s domestic audience, in which it claims: Leontyev said that there was no explosion at the station, but night strikes led to the destruction and water began to uncontrollably be discharged downstream. According to him, the armed forces of Ukraine continue to shell the city. The blow to the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, presumably, was delivered from an MLRS [multiple launch rocket system]. Leontyev said that it is still impossible to predict whether the Kakhovskaya HPP will continue to collapse. According to him, the hydroelectric power plant has suffered serious damage and it is presumably impossible to repair it. As the mayor added, the destruction at the station will lead to problems in the delivery of water to the Crimea. At the same time, the destruction does not pose any critical danger for the Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant]. Leontyev called the incident a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them.” He said that the consequences will still be studied, the main task now is to help citizens. Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine “in a panic”, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Tuesday. “The occupiers blew up the dam of the Kakhovka reservoir in a panic – this is an obvious act of terrorism and a war crime, which will be evidence in an international tribunal,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on Telegram. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction of the dam in southern Ukraine on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he told Reuters. “We’ll continue to assess the developing situation, but the best thing Russia could do now is withdraw their troops immediately.” Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, has told Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” A Russian-installed official in the town of Nova Kakhovka said on Tuesday residents of about 300 houses had been evacuated after the nearby dam was breached, state-owned news agency Tass reported. Reuters reports that Tass also quoted Nova Kakhovka’s Russian-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, as saying that part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant was completely destroyed “as a result of the explosion of the engine room from the inside” and is not repairable. It cites Ukrahydroenergo. More details soon … Julian Borger and Dan Sabbagh report from Kyiv for the Guardian: The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. As aerial footage circulated on social media, showing most of the dam wall washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream, the army’s Southern Operational Command put up a Facebook post accusing “Russian occupation troops” of blowing up the hydroelectric dam. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken to bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and on to other Ukrainian cities. The disaster happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. Local Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied that anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday in the wake of the disaster. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the river downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people would lose their homes. There could be two further dramatic side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could be severely affected.

He suggests that the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River is more at risk. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory, but that “everything is under control”. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the Ukrainian military claims to have shot down a Russian Ka-52 helicopter in the direction of Shakhtarsk on Monday, citing the general staff. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is my colleague Jonathan Yerushalmy on why the dam is so significant and poses such a threat: The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The reservoir it contains holds an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Soon after Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, the head of the Kherson region urged residents to evacuate the area, warning that “water will reach a critical level in five hours”. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also probably wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. Read more here: Nova Kakhovka Dam – everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and an adviser to the interior ministry, has suggested on social media that about 16,000 people may be affected by any potential flood from the breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The video footage in his tweet has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has said that “only force” can solve the “global threat” posed by Russia, in a message on the Telegram app. He posted: The destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP is the largest man-made disaster in the world in recent decades, which kills the environment and will negatively affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the years to come. The insane goal of stopping the defence forces’ advance and avoiding defeat and disgrace drives Kremlin criminals. They are willing to do anything to raise the stakes in this war. Today’s Russia is a global threat. Only force can solve this problem. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam who will bring you the latest from the aftermath of this very distressing development in the war. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”: The Financial Times’ Moscow bureau chief has shared modelling done previously on how the dam’s destruction is likely to affect Kherson: Prof Hubert Chanson, from the University of QLD School of Civil Engineering, expects that a flood of water from the destroyed Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine will put people at risk of drowning and slow military action further downstream. “Anyone living in low-lying areas downstream of the dam could be drowned,” he says. “Significant flooding is likely to happen, depending on the volume of the dam at the time. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the destruction of the dam is to slow down military action further downstream. A large body of water behind a low-lying dam could cause a long-lasting flood that is not going to end in a couple of days.” Restoration of the dam is “not going to be a quick fix”, Chanson says. Repair will include blocking the bridge and the opening in the dam, typically by dumping rocks or concrete blocks. “To do so would be a matter of civil engineering,” he says. “You can only do so if in a secure environment, if one party is in charge of the dam and has access to the dam site.” Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company, has responded to the damage to the dam, saying it “may have negative consequences for the [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant], but the situation is under control”. It has blamed the dam’s flooding on Russian forces, saying, “On the night of June 6, 2023, the Russian invaders blew up the dam of the Kakhovskaya HPP.” It explained that the “rapidly decreasing” water levels in the reservoir posed an “additional threat to the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP.” For now, however, the nuclear power station’s cooling pond was full, it said. Water from the Kakhovsky reservoir is necessary for the station to receive power for turbine capacitors and safety systems of the ZNPP. The station’s cooling pond is now full: as of 8am, the water level is 16.6 metres, which is sufficient for the station’s needs. Energoatom monitors the situation and follows the actions of workers at the ZNPP together with other international organisations present at the plant, in particular, the IAEA. Any changes will be promptly notified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that what he called the “destruction” of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” He added: “All services are working. I have convened the national security and defence council.” In May, residents in a nearby village reported ongoing flooding which they blamed on Russia’s occupation of Nova Kakhovka. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, locals said the water level had begun to rise in April, sometimes by up to 30cm a day, and had remained elevated since. Ukrainian officials said the “rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam”. But they added that they were unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because they did not have access themselves. A Russian energy official also warned in May that the dam risked being overwhelmed by record-high water levels. This unverified footage reportedly shows the view from the top of the dam’s generator hall: If you’re just joining us, a vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. You can get in touch with me on Twitter here. Here is what we know so far: Unverified videos on social media showed water surging through the remains of the dam, with bystanders expressing their shock. Ukraine’s national police urged people in affected villages to evacuate. The police force named the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson – Korabel Island. “Units of the national police and the state emergency service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River” the police force said on Telegram. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will hold an emergency meeting, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said on Twitter on Tuesday. The Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. The dam, 30 metres tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka [dam] was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the south command of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling, while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. Russia’s destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine represents an “ecocide”, but national and regional officials are working to ensure the safety of local residents, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration said on Tuesday. Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram that Russia’s actions also present a threat to the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, without elaborating Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Nova Kakhovka dam has been earmarked as a potential target for both its strategic importance - as well as the damage that its destruction would unleash. It was captured by Russia at the start of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, and has been held by it ever since. In October, as Ukraine was in the midst of reclaiming large parts of occupied Kherson, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to warn Russia not to blow up the dam, warning that it would flood a large area of southern Ukraine. At the time, he claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives inside the dam. Zelenskiy said “destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,” and compared such an act to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine military intelligence said “the scale of the ecological disaster [would] go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”. At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it. After Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November, images emerged of some significant damage to the dam. Russia had accused Ukraine of shelling the dam in its campaign to recapture Kherson. Here is more video of the dam flooding, via the Kyiv post: Ukraine’s National Security Council has announced that Zelenskiy will hold an emergency meeting over the dam blast. On 25 May Reuters reported that Ukrhydroenergo, which owns the dam, had blamed high water levels in the Dnieper river on Russia. “The rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam,” state company said in a statement. It said the 17-metre (56-foot) level in the pool held back by the dam was a metre higher than normal for this time of year, Reuters reported. But the company said it was unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because it did not have access itself. The dam was at “unprecedentedly” high levels before today, the Washington Post’s Evan Hill reports: Washington Post investigative journalist Evan Hill has shared satellite images showing what appears to be evidence that a section of the dam was damaged or destroyed on 5 June: Here is a larger image showing the dam on 28 May this year: And yesterday at 12:15pm local time: Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. Here is the unverified footage of the dam flooding being shared widely on social media, including by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine: Ukraine’s National Police force are asking people in affected villages to evacuate. The Police said on Telegram a moment ago: Units of the National Police and the State Emergency Service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River, namely: the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson - Korabel Island. The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: 🔹turn off all electrical appliances 🔹take documents and essentials 🔹take care of loved ones and pets 🔹 follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, has posted more details about evacuations to Telegram. Residents in what he called the “danger zone” were also urged to turn off electrical appliances. Gerashchenkosaid: ❗️ In the Kherson region, the settlements on the right bank of the Dnieper have been named as being at risk of flooding Evacuation of the civilian population from potential flood zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River is underway, namely: ▪️ The village of Nikolaevka, ▪️ Olgovka, ▪️ Лёво, ▪️ Tyaginka, ▪️ Ivanivka, ▪️ Ivanovka, ▪️Tokarevka, ▪️ Pridneprovskoye, ▪️Partly the city of Kherson - the island of Korabel. The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: 🔹turn off all electrical appliances, 🔹take documents and essential items, 🔹will take care of loved ones and pets, 🔹 follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen. Here is a summary of what we know so far, via Reuters: A vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. The dam, 30 metres (yards) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnieper river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and also supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka (dam) was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnieper River, holding back an enormous reservoir of water. The dam itself is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The enormous reservoir that it contains holds about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south - which was annexed by Russia in 2014 - as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydro-electric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. The UK ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, has retweeted a post calling what has happened at the dam “An appalling act of ecocide by the Russian regime”. The large Nova Kakhovka Dam in the Russia-controlled parts of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was destroyed and the territory is flooding, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source close to the matter. A second state news agency RIA cited the Moscow-installed Mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying that the upper part of the dam was destroyed by shelling. The mayor earlier denied that that the dam had been blown up. Tass then quoted him as saying that the destruction of the dam was a “serious terrorist act”. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian were able to independently verify the reports. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson region, has posted a video to Telegram in which he says that as a result of the damage to the Nova Kahhovka dam, “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours” and that evacuations have begun. The translation of the video was obtained via Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Gerashchenko posted the video from Prokudin’s Telegram, with the text: The water will reach a critical level in 5 hours, the evacuation has begun - the head of Kherson OVA As Alexander Prokudin reported, local residents have already begun to be evacuated from potential flood areas. He confirmed that the [Russians] had blown up the Kakhovskaya HPP and called for them to leave the dangerous places as soon as possible. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnieper River was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. The Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine’s Kherson region was blown up by Russian forces, the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified,” the command said on its Facebook page. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. In breaking news: Ukraine’s Southern Military command has accused Russia of “blowing up” the Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson, “likely” causing flooding. The Guardian has not been able to verify the claim. Unverified video footage shared on social media on Tuesday morning appeared to show a large amount of water flowing out of the dam. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the dam was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian have been able to independently verify the reports. We’ll have more information shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has confirmed that in some areas Kyiv’s forces are moving to “offensive actions”, heightening speculation that a counteroffensive is close to launch. Russia claimed to have repelled a “major offensive” in the Donetsk region and to have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops, but the claims could not be independently verified. The defence ministry in Moscow said Ukraine had attacked with six mechanised and two tank battalions from two brigades. The ministry claimed 250 Ukrainian troops had been killed, and 16 tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles and 21 armoured personnel carriers destroyed. It also claimed that Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of general staff, had been near the frontlines when the attack was repelled. The Russian defence ministry has consistently made exaggerated claims about the casualties its forces have inflicted. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed on Monday what he called “the news we have been waiting for” from troops in Bakhmut, but gave no further details. “I am grateful to each soldier, to all our defenders, men and women, who have given us today the news we have been waiting for. Fine job, soldiers in the Bakhmut sector!” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. The US imposed sanctions on members of a Russian intelligence-linked group for their role in Moscow’s efforts to destabilise democracy and influence elections in Moldova, the Treasury department said. The sanctions target seven individuals, several of whom maintain ties to Russian intelligence services, the department said. They include the group’s leader, Konstantin Prokopyevich Sapozhnikov, who organised the plot to destabilise the government of Moldova, which borders Ukraine, earlier this year. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. They discussed preparations for the Nato summit in Lithuania next month and Ukraine’s plan for ending Russia’s invasion. During the meeting, Cleverly said: “Ukraine will win this war and can count on our support.” Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, said three people were killed in the region yesterday as a result of Russian attacks. Two drones have fallen on the M3 Ukraine highway, in the Russian region of Kaluga, just south of Moscow, the region’s governor has said. There was no detonation and the sites have been cordoned off by investigators, said governor Vladislav Shapsha. Poland’s agriculture minister has received a draft regulation from the European Commission extending a ban on Ukrainian grain imports until 15 September, he said on Monday. Belgium will ask Ukraine for clarification on reports that rifles made in Belgium had been used by pro-Ukrainian forces to fight Russian troops inside Russia’s western border, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T00:58:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine faces power outages after ‘massive’ Russian strikes target energy facilities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had launched a “massive attack” on Ukraine, with some strikes reported on energy infrastructure that resulted in power outages across the country. More than a dozen Russian missiles pounded energy facilities and other infrastructure across Ukraine on Saturday, the Ukrainian air force said, with strikes causing blackouts in parts of different regions. Russian airstrikes on energy facilities across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said earlier on Saturday. Fresh strikes targeted energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s west, Ukraine’s energy operator Ukrenergo said on social media, and officials in several regions of the war-scarred country reported power outages. “These are vile strikes on critical objects,” Zelenskiy said earlier on Saturday. “The world can and must stop this terror.” Power outages were reported in other parts of the country and local officials repeated calls to reduce energy use. Some parts of Ukraine have already cut their electricity use by up to 20%, according to Ukrenergo. Parts of Kyiv suffered power cuts into the evening. In one central district, shops were closed and traffic lights were off. “The geography of this latest mass strike is very wide,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, citing regions in western, central and southern Ukraine. “Of course we don’t have the technical ability to knock down 100% of the Russian missiles and strike drones. I am sure that, gradually, we will achieve that, with help from our partners. Already now, we are downing a majority of cruise missiles, a majority of drones.” Ukrainian forces had downed 20 missiles and more than 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones on Saturday, Zelenskiy said. The air force command earlier had said 33 missiles had been fired at Ukraine. Eighteen were shot down. Most of the western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug River and had a pre-war population of 275,000, was left with no electricity, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. In a social media post on Saturday, the city council urged local residents to store water “in case it’s also gone within an hour.” In the Russian Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, at least two civilians were killed in strikes on Saturday, according to the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Nearly 15,000 people were left without electricity, he said. Russia last week reported a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory, saying attacks had largely concentrated on the Belgorod region and neighbouring regions of Bryansk and Kursk. Reuters witnesses in the southern city of Mykolaiv reported a power cut over several hours, disrupting mobile phone signals. In the south-eastern city of Nikopol, which is regularly shelled from Russian positions across the Dnieper River, local authorities warned that air raid sirens would be switched off as a result of power cuts. Instead, emergency vehicles driving around the city would warn of incoming aerial threats, officials said. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Moscow wanted to create a new wave of refugees into Europe with the strikes, while the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Twitter that the attacks constituted genocide. Moscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians. State grid operator Ukrenergo said the attacks targeted transmission infrastructure in western Ukraine, but that supply restrictions were imposed in 10 regions, including in Kyiv. “The scale of damage is comparable or may exceed the consequences of the attacks [between] October 10-12,” Ukrenergo wrote on the Telegram app, referring to the first wave of strikes on the power system last week. The deputy head of Kyiv’s city administration, Petro Panteleev, warned that Russian strikes could leave Ukraine’s capital without power and heat for “several days or weeks”.

Defence funding as a share of the economy is expected to grow from 2.04% now to 2.3% in a decade’s time. The government has repeatedly said the funding for the nuclear-powered submarines and the defence strategic review will be budget-neutral over the first four years because of other cuts it has made within the portfolio. Spending announced so far includes $19bn over the coming four years “for nuclear-powered submarines, long-range strike capabilities, strengthened northern bases, workforce growth and retention, innovation, and regional partnerships”. But overall defence funding as a share of gross domestic product is expected to remain fairly constant over the first four years, with costs ramping up after that point. The budget papers reveal the government “has included a spending provision in the contingency reserve for increased defence funding over the medium term to implement the defence strategic review”. Officials confirmed that this additional spending provision was worth $30.5bn between the 2027-28 and 2032-33 financial years. This will mean defence funding reaches 2.3% of gross domestic product at the end of this 10-year period. The government says this is 0.2% higher than the trajectory Labor inherited from the Coalition. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Key decisions loom when the government prepares a new national defence strategy in 2024. The government has not ruled out further cuts within defence to fund higher priorities. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the government had “made no secret that we are willing to make the hard decisions in order to get the best outcome for our ADF”. Tuesday night’s budget lists Aukus as one of numerous “fiscal risks” the government will need to manage. The budget does not adjust the long-term estimate that the submarine project will cost between $268bn and $368bn over the period from now to the mid-2050s. This figure includes $9bn over the first four-year budget period – and between $50bn and $58bn over the first 10 years. But while Tuesday’s budget includes funding for some initial Aukus costs, officials included a warning about the uncertainty surrounding the complex multi-decade program. “The total costs associated with the program will not be known until design and production processes are settled and commercial and other arrangements are finalised between governments and delivery partners,” the budget papers warn. Of initial funding that is certain, the government has earmarked $4.5bn over 10 years “to support the initial steps in Australia’s acquisition of a conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability”. The majority of this – $4.2bn – is to establish and fund the operations of a new Australian submarine agency to manage the overall program. The government has earmarked $127m over four years for 4,000 additional commonwealth-supported places at universities and other higher education providers “for courses that support the skills requirements of the nuclear-powered submarine program, including STEM and management disciplines”. At least 800 of these places will be reserved for South Australian universities. The government is promising $11m over three years to extend the defence industry pathways program within the shipbuilding sector of Western Australia. The Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office will get $22m in funding over two years “to support the establishment of non-proliferation and safeguard arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency”. There will be $5.2m for the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency “to support the development of radioactive waste management, storage and disposal arrangements”. The government has decided to provide Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd with an equity injection “to commence early construction and design works for a submarine construction yard and to design the Skills and Training Academy in South Australia”. But the government is refusing to break down that amount because of “commercial sensitivities”. The defence budget also includes an extra $190m over two years to provide assistance to Ukraine fighting the invasion by Russia, about $40m of which relates to measures that are yet to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-09T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Stalking the Atomic City by Markiyan Kamysh review – in search of meaning in Chornobyl’s forbidden wasteland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","fields":{"bodyText":"The area around Chornobyl was once meant to be a paradise. “They even planned to build a promenade with bridges, street lights and musical entertainment. They already started to lay the foundation of new power plant units, the apotheosis of joy and happiness looming on the horizon,” writes Markiyan Kamysh. “Until,” he says, with characteristic directness, “things got fucked and reactor number 4 blew the hell up.” Kamysh was born in 1988, two years after that calamity, the son of a nuclear physicist who had been brought in to work as a liquidator after the meltdown. The families of liquidators were given social benefits, and cheaper food – but this association was also a source of radioactive stigma, not to mention ill health. Kamysh’s father died in 2003. A few years later Kamysh dropped out of university in Kyiv to dedicate himself to literature and the exploration of the exclusion zone around Chornobyl – as well as the disaster’s fallout in his own psyche. He also started leading other people into the forbidden territory around the reactor, evading the police and ducking under wire fences, acting like a real-life version of the guides who take people to a forbidden area in Andrei Tarkovsky’s mysterious sci-fi film Stalker. Kamysh undertook those trips for money, but in this account, which he wrote between 2012 and 2014, he also describes the fallout zone as somewhere he can “relax”. He goes there to drink with friends, to celebrate New Year’s Eve, to wander alone among the ruins. He brings back descriptions of empty streets, the “jungles” that are spreading across the landscape, the cries of wolves in the night. Kamysh describes himself as a “degenerate”. On his trips into the zone he drinks and destroys. He makes fires with old physics textbooks and burns floorboards for heating. He smashes windows. He has a terrifying disregard for his own safety. He even jokes about meeting other stalkers in cancer wards in 20 years’ time. He can be brutally funny (credit for this must go partly to translators Hanna Leliv and Reilly Costigan-Humes), but he also demands serious attention. To those asking if he’s afraid of radiation, he says: “No. It’s only here that life won’t slip by for me, for I’m living it in the most exotic place on Earth.” By the time we get to that explanation, late on in this remarkable book, Kamysh has made us understand why he thinks the zone around Chornobyl is so special, why – because of its desolate serenity, and the freedom it grants from the strictures of normal life – it may even be worth dying for. No mean feat. It’s all the more unsettling to read about this bargain with death now that invading Russian troops have also blundered into his poisoned paradise. At least Kamysh had a choice, strange as it may seem. • Stalking the Atomic City: Life Among the Decadent and Depraved of Chornobyl by Markiyan Kamysh is published by Pushkin Press (£12.99).

Its electricity system operator (ESO) has increased the incentive sixfold to £3 per kilowatt hour (kWh) to encourage households to use their washing machines and appliances late at night, which could mean typical savings of £100 this winter. National Grid warned this month that homes could face three-hour power cuts if Russia blocks gas supplies into Europe and Britain experiences sustained cold weather, increasing the amount that households use for heating. In response, it has beefed up plans for businesses and households to participate in its “demand flexibility service”, which launches next month. Writing exclusively for the Guardian, Fintan Slye, the director of National Grid ESO, said on Thursday: “Businesses and homes can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too. “For a consumer that could mean a typical household could save approximately £100 and, for industrial and commercial businesses with larger energy usage, they could potentially save multiples of this.” The ESO had originally planned to pay households with smart meters about 52p per kilowatt hour in credit via their energy suppliers if they avoid using appliances at times when high demand puts strain on the system. However, the introduction of support for businesses and households announced by Liz Truss last month made the scheme less attractive, at the equivalent of 34p per kWh. As a result, the ESO said it expects to pay the equivalent of £3 per kWh, “as feedback indicates this will unlock the majority of the available volume”. This money will be paid to suppliers in the form of a £3,000 per megawatt hour (MWh) minimum price, and those payments could go higher. Slye said he was “confident” the scheme could free up about 2 gigawatts (GW) of power, enough for about 1m homes. As businesses consume far more energy than domestic customers, their savings could be much higher. Only Octopus Energy, which piloted the initiative earlier this year, has formally signed up. However, it is understood E.ON and Ovo are among those interested in signing up. Under a similar scheme also launching next month, Ovo customers who use less than 12.5% of the energy they consume in a day between the peak hours of 4pm and 7pm will receive £20 for each month they hit this target. The five-month trial from 1 November could save them £100 as a result. The more firms and homes that sign up to the ESO plan, the greater the reduction in the pressure on the energy network with consumers putting on their washing machine or appliances at night instead of busier periods. Octopus and E.ON had claimed the energy discount incentive was too low, arguing that fewer people would sign up as a result, the Times reported last month. Slye also detailed how National Grid would inform households if there were to be power cuts this winter. He said consumers would receive 24 hours notice and social media influencers could even be called on to spread the message. He wrote: “We are working with government and industry on planning for this so that the message can be spread across all communities as quickly and accurately as possible. This would include press conferences, social media campaigns, and working with influencers in different communities.” • This article was amended on 21 October 2022 because an earlier version referred to kWh units as kW/h."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T14:00:27Z","webTitle":"Coal-fired power plants could receive bulk of price cap compensation, Treasury briefings suggest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government’s plan to compensate New South Wales and Queensland for imposing a cap on coal prices could run “significantly” above $500m with most of the money directed to coal-fired power plants, according to Treasury briefings. The compensation for the $125 a tonne price cap for black coal is part of the package announced by the government on Friday to lower energy prices. There would be compensation for coalminers but the bulk of the money would be for power stations, sources say. “The generators would get the lion’s share,” one of those briefed told Guardian Australia. “It could be significantly higher than $500m,” they said, with the figure possibly running to hundreds of millions of dollars more. NSW generators could receive as much as $250m, one NSW official said. Black coal-fired power plants contract most of their coal at long-term rates below $125 but some contracts are above that price – hence the compensation. The federal government has so far downplayed the potential of a big payment for those affected by the price cap on coal. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told the ABC on Monday “there’s nothing in the legislation” that provides compensation. However, Albanese said if fossil fuel companies faced production costs above $125 a tonne “it is reasonable that there be payments made” to ensure continued supply. The Nine newspapers reported on Sunday the government could spend up to $500m to compensate producers affected by the coal price caps. The federal industry minister, Ed Husic, on Tuesday did not specifically rule out compensation to coal companies but said this week’s legislation was focused on gas. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The office of the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, highlighted comments he made earlier on Tuesday that “a range of mechanisms” could be applied to set the coal price – a power that resides with states. “The NSW government has asked us to ensure that any coal company which has a genuine cost of production over $125 is catered for,” Bowen said. “We think that is a very, very rare circumstance.” Albanese on Tuesday also expressed support for a federal gas reservation policy. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said his party would not support compensation for coal. He urged the government to provide more detail on its plan and reiterated calls for a windfall profits tax on fossil fuels. He said the Greens hoped to reach an agreement before parliament resumed on Thursday. The Greens and the Coalition have asked for more detail on exactly what legislation will be introduced. “We want to see people get energy bill relief, but we still have concerns about Labor’s plan,” Bandt said. “People deserve lower power bills, but massive coal and gas corporations don’t deserve a cent of public money.” The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union secretary, Steve Murphy, said any payment or supply incentive made to suppliers must benefit consumers, not become a “corporate handout”. “Giving half a billion dollars to some of the richest CEOs in the country without clear and enforceable conditions would do nothing to help workers or bring prices down,” he said. The government will introduce a bill to cap gas prices at a special sitting of parliament on Thursday. Commonwealth funds to support rebates for households and small businesses will be included as a schedule to the bill. The schedule will enable agreements to be entered into between the commonwealth and each of the states and territories to provide energy price relief, and the funding will be provided in relation to the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 financial years up to $1.5bn. Details of the rebates are yet to be settled. The arrangements will be determined by the federal and state treasurers. Senators are negotiating how long the debate could continue and whether it would be gagged to avoid sitting late into Thursday night. Major energy companies said they remained in the dark about how the policy might affect their operations. Gas firms have been public in their opposition to the proposed “reasonable pricing” mechanism contained within the amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act that parliament will vote on. One of those briefed by Treasury said compensation for coalminers was unlikely to exceed several tens of millions of dollars. Treasury officials told journalists on Friday the $125 cap had been chosen because few miners would be out of pocket. Their main contracts with foreign or domestic customers would not be affected by the energy package. Guardian Australia understands NSW continues to negotiate over the terms for its state. Major generators, too, were unsure how the policy would affect them. “We’re still trying to understand a lot of this stuff,” one senior source said. “There is not any certainty.” A senior official at another company said they wanted to know whether rivals would essentially be bailed out for poorly managing coal supplies. Their firm had long-term contracts for most of its coal at less than $125 a tonne but had been buying extra fuel well above that price to ensure supply in case of disruptions. The official questioned the wisdom of making it cheaper for consumers to use fossil fuels. The government’s plan “encourages more burning of coal and gas”, they said. The government would in effect be acting as a contracting party, picking up the risk and price gap for generators if there is one, said Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. Uncertainty over those factors is one reason why the quantity of compensation to generators may be difficult to model. If the price caps for coal and gas remained beyond the end of June 2024 – the current schedule for the temporary measures – they could discourage the transition to zero-carbon options such as big batteries. Another person briefed by Treasury said the government was assuming the war in Ukraine would be over in a year’s time – with global energy prices subsequently falling. However, countries would be reluctant to return to sourcing energy from Russia given the risks. Simon Corbell, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group and a former deputy ACT chief minister, said his organisation welcomed the short-term price caps as “a reasonable measure”. But “a long-term intervention could dampen investment signals for next-generation storage and new-build renewable generation”, he said. Over time, the government should work to reduce the risks for clean energy investments such as setting a clearer timeframe for the orderly exit of coal-fired power plants, and the construction of transmission lines to link up new wind and solar farms and avoid unnecessary congestion and curtailment, Corbell said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:34:04Z","webTitle":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","fields":{"bodyText":"As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it’s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain’s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country’s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe’s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a “dark lull”) conditions – with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days – left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain’s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving – the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government’s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: “It could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues – that’s why we have seen gas prices go up.” He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain’s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass – particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire – and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica’s Rough – shut down after the government refused to support it – have also been called into action, although Britain’s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors – the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron’s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). “It may not come down to resource nationalism,” Piper says. “If France doesn’t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.” Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated £18m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over “nanny state intervention” against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: “As we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn’t be more important – both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. “The government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.” Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry’s first big test of an extraordinary winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T02:49:56Z","webTitle":"Richard Marles condemns Russia’s ‘appalling’ nuclear threat and pledges long-term Ukraine support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","fields":{"bodyText":"The defence minister, Richard Marles, has condemned the latest nuclear threat from Russia as “appalling”, and says Australia is preparing to support Ukraine for a protracted military conflict. Speaking on Sunday, the deputy prime minister said the threat from the Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to use the country’s nuclear arsenal as part of its ongoing war with Ukraine could “not be allowed to stand”. “Certainly the comments cause anxiety, you can’t hide from that,” Marles told Sky News. “We’ve heard the president make those threats before [and] they are appalling comments to make. “It is clearly an appalling thing to do, to place that potential on the table.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a televised address to the nation last week, Putin said that Russia was positioning itself in response to the threat from the west, which “wants to destroy our country”, as he threatened to use the “various means of destruction” it had at its disposal. “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,” Putin said. “It’s not a bluff.” The comments sparked widespread condemnation and the threat of more sanctions from G7 countries, while the foreign minister, Penny Wong, suggested the government would consider the expulsion of the Russian ambassador in response. Amid the escalation, Marles was also critical of Putin’s decision to mobilise 300,000 reservists, describing the move as “a step in completely the wrong direction.” “Russia needs to stop and Russia needs to leave Ukraine,” he said. “I think the scenes that we’ve seen from Russia over the last few days, of people seeking to leave the country, of obvious distress for those being called up and being asked to serve in the Russian forces in respect of this says everything about where public opinion is actually at within Russia.” Marles, who has recently met with officials from Nato countries in Europe, also said Australia would provide further and ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. It follows requests from the country’s ambassador for 30 more Bushmaster armoured vehicles, 30 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles and Howitzer missiles. He said he would not yet reveal the details of Australia’s military commitment, but confirmed there would be additional support. “What we understand is that Ukraine is going to need support over a long period of time,” Marles said. “That’s very much the sense when I was in Europe and speaking to Nato countries – Germany, UK, France – all of those countries are really steeling themselves for this being an effort which needs to be undertaken over a long period of time, and that the importance of standing with Ukraine and enabling Ukraine to be empowered to resolve this on their own terms is fundamentally important. “Rest assured that we’re talking with the Ukrainian ambassador, talking with Ukrainian government, about the way in which Australia can be there and be there over the long term, because we get that this has all the potential to be a protracted conflict.” Marles also rejected suggestions from the federal opposition that the delivery of Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine had been delayed by red tape, saying the project schedule was “on time”. “The Ukrainians are very appreciative with the speed with which Bushmasters have been delivered to Ukraine,” he said. “It’s not in Ukraine’s interest for us to make public what that delivery schedule is. But the delivery schedule is there. It’s on time and they’re getting those Bushmasters. And they’re having a really big impact.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T03:48:57Z","webTitle":"Russian forces capture Ukraine’s second-biggest power station ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","fields":{"bodyText":"Russian forces have taken over Ukraine’s second-biggest power plant and are conducting a “massive redeployment” of troops to three southern regions, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said, amid expectations of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Russian-backed forces said on Wednesday they had captured intact the Soviet-era coal-fired Vuhlehirska power plant, in what is Moscow’s first significant gain in more than three weeks. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed the capture of the plant in the eastern Donetsk region, but said it was only a “tiny tactical advantage” for Russia. The Russian redeployment to the south appeared to be a switch from offence to strategic defence, he added, with troops sent to the Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Ukraine has made clear it intends to recapture the southern city of Kherson, which fell to Russia in the early days of the war. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, earlier tweeted that Russia was concentrating “the maximum number of troops” in the direction of Kherson but gave no details. Arestovych also said Ukraine’s operation to liberate Kherson “has already begun” after striking the Antonivskiy Bridge – a key Russian supply route into the Russian-occupied southern city on Wednesday. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy said: “We are doing everything to ensure that the occupying forces do not have any logistical opportunities in our country”, and promised to rebuild the Antonivskiy Bridge and other crossings in the region. Russian officials earlier said they would turn instead to pontoon bridges and ferries to get forces across the river. Arestovych also confirmed Ukraine’s strategy to isolate Russian forces, saying in an interview with Ukrainian television on Wednesday night that there was a “certain plan” of the armed forces of Ukraine to “isolate [Russia’s] military operations”. “No matter how much the enemy overtakes forces and resources on the western bank of the Dnieper, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will first leave them without ammunition depots, fuel, communications and command, and then they will clean up the remnants of their forces,” he said, adding that Russian forces had three options: “Retreat (if possible), surrender or be destroyed.” Another senior presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added: “Occupiers should learn how to swim across the Dnieper river. Or should leave Kherson while it is still possible. There may not be a third warning.” Ukrainian forces in the south said they had killed 66 enemy troops and destroyed three tanks and two arms dumps in the past 24 hours. Russian forces attacked the city of Mykolaiv with multiple rocket launchers, they added. Reuters was unable to verify the battlefield reports. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he planned a phone conversation with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov – the first between the two diplomats since before the start of the war. The call in the coming days would not be “a negotiation about Ukraine”, Blinken said at a news conference, restating Washington’s position that any talks on ending the war must be between Kyiv and Moscow. Aside from discussing Americans detained by Russia, Blinken said he would raise with Lavrov the tentative deal on grain exports reached last week between Russia, the US, Turkey and Ukraine. Russia has received no formal request from Washington about a phone call between Blinken and Lavrov, Tass news agency reported. The US has made “a substantial offer” to Russia for it to release two US citizens, WNBA star Brittney Griner and former US Marine Paul Whelan, Blinken said, without giving details of what the US was offering in return. Blinken said he would press Lavrov to respond to the offer. A source familiar with the situation confirmed a CNN report that Washington was willing to exchange Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US, as part of a deal. The last publicly recognised contact between Blinken and Lavrov was 22 February, when Blinken wrote to Lavrov to cancel a meeting they had planned as a last-ditch effort to avert the Russian invasion, saying Moscow had shown no interest in serious diplomacy on the matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/03/solar-panels-could-be-a-lifesaver-for-public-housing-tenants-grappling-with-australias-soaring-energy-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T15:00:25Z","webTitle":"Solar panels could be a lifesaver for public housing tenants grappling with Australia’s soaring energy costs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/03/solar-panels-could-be-a-lifesaver-for-public-housing-tenants-grappling-with-australias-soaring-energy-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/03/solar-panels-could-be-a-lifesaver-for-public-housing-tenants-grappling-with-australias-soaring-energy-costs","fields":{"bodyText":"Natalie Rabey doesn’t know how much time she has left. But she knows what she wants to do with it. “While I’m still breathing, I’d like to get some action on solar panels for people in public housing, because it’s just terrible at the moment,” she says. The 73-year-old public housing resident has spent more than a decade advocating for improved living conditions for public tenants in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. She says with the cost of living soaring, she has never seen so many people doing it so tough. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “A lot of people around here are getting help from the Salvos and neighbourhood houses with food, especially pensioners. How are they supposed to pay their power bills, medication, groceries when it’s all going up by so much?” Rabey says. “I know some people are just not turning their heaters on in winter, while the ones who have air conditioners, they don’t use them at all in the summer because they can’t afford to. Others are just switching everything off.” For Rabey, this is not an option. She has permanent scarring on her lungs following a viral infection that put her in hospital for nine weeks. As a result, she needs to use an oxygen machine and run two air purifiers and a compressor 24 hours a day. “I don’t know what it’s going cost me as we head into winter because I have to keep the heating on throughout the night, because otherwise in the morning it’s freezing and I start coughing up,” Rabey says. She is backing a push by the Victorian Public Tenants’ Association to install solar panels on every public housing property in the state. In its state budget submission, the VPTA, the peak body representing existing public housing renters and those on the waitlist, estimates 23,500 existing public housing properties are suitable for installation of rooftop solar panels. It could save each household up to $535.49 each year in energy bills. The VPTA chief executive, Katelyn Butterss, said the proposal would tackle cost-of-living pressures for low-income households, help Victoria reach its emissions reductions targets, and create more than 1,000 jobs. “Homeowners, people who live in community housing and those in private rentals have had an opportunity to access subsidised solar panel installations, while the tenants of Victoria’s biggest landlord – the director of housing – are the only people left behind,” she said. “It’s time they also reaped the benefits.” The VPTA’s submission also calls for a program that would see vacant property owners lease their homes to the government for temporary inclusion in the public housing stock for up to 15 years. The government would pay participants market rent plus 1%. To encourage owners to join the program, the government could increase the vacant residential land tax or apply it to more parts of the state, the submission states. Butterss said the idea followed the release of 2021 census figures last year, which showed there were 1m unoccupied properties across Australia – or 10% of all housing stock – on census night. “That’s really hard to reconcile when in Victoria, there are more than 100,000 individual Victorians waiting for access to safe, secure, affordable housing,” she said. She described the proposal as a “stopgap” until the government’s $5.3bn “Big Housing Build” to construct more than 12,000 new homes eventuates. However, she warned it was likely these new properties would make only a small dent on the “very swollen waitlist”. Rabey is keen to stress that most people in public housing don’t want to be there. “Sometimes stuff happens to people in their lives that they can’t control,” she says. “I only ended up here because my brother’s business went down. That’s life. So we should try to make it a bit easier when we can.” “I don’t know how long I have left but I want to see this one through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T09:27:27Z","webTitle":"Kamala Harris hits out at North Korea’s ‘provocative nuclear rhetoric’ on DMZ visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","fields":{"bodyText":"The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has condemned North Korea’s “provocative nuclear rhetoric” during a trip to South Korea that included a visit to the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula. Harris arrived in Seoul on Thursday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, in a move that underlines Washington’s struggle to rein in the regime’s weapons programme. Her visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) – which has divided the peninsula since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an uneasy truce – was intended to demonstrate the US’s commitment to South Korea, a key ally in the region. Harris looked through binoculars as a South Korean colonel pointed out military installations on the southern side. An American colonel then pointed out some of the defences along the military demarcation line, which marks the boundary between the two Koreas, including barbed wire fences and mines. “It’s so close,” Harris said. Earlier, she told US military personnel at a nearby base “how grateful and thankful we are” for their role in protecting the southern side of the tense border between the two Koreas. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has overseen a record number of missile launches this year, including one that involved a long-range weapon. Officials in Seoul and Washington have warned that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a nuclear test. In a meeting in Seoul with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, Harris praised the alliance between the two countries as a “linchpin of security and prosperity. I’m here to reinforce the strength of our alliance and strengthen our work together”. Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, called her visit “another turning point” in strengthening bilateral ties. They reaffirmed their commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and “condemned [North Korea’s] provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches, in violation of UN security council resolutions”, the White House said in a statement. “They discussed our response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral cooperation with Japan.” The DMZ has become a regular stop for visiting US officials eager to demonstrate their resolve on North Korean weapons’ development and their commitment to the security of South Korea, where 28,5000 US troops are based. The 155-mile (250km) long border is highly fortified with razor wire, heavy armaments and tank traps on either side of a 2.5-mile wide buffer. Ronald Reagan was the first US president to visit the DMZ, but Bill Clinton – who described it as “the scariest place on Earth” during a 1993 visit – and Donald Trump are the only sitting presidents to have visited the Joint Security Area, a cluster of buildings that hosts inter-Korean talks, and the only place where troops from both sides directly face each other. Harris’s visit comes at a time of rising tensions on the peninsula. This week, the US and South Korea launched large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years. The allies insist that their joint drills are purely defensive, but North Korea routinely condemns them as rehearsals for an invasion. Earlier this week, Harris condemned Pyongyang’s “illicit weapons programme” during a speech at a naval base in Japan, where she also attended the state funeral of the country’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe. Speculation is building that North Korea is preparing to detonate a nuclear device in what would be its seventh nuclear test since 2006. Pyongyang claimed that its most recent test, in 2017, involved its most powerful weapon to date. This week, the South Korean spy agency said North Korea appeared to have completed a third tunnel at its Punggye-ri nuclear site as part of preparations for a test, according to a South Korean MP who attended a closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service. The lawmaker said Pyongyang was likely to conduct the test after the end of the Chinese Communist party congress, which begins on 16 October, and before US midterm elections on 8 November. Kim Jong-dae, of the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, said the latest missile launches were an attempt by the regime “to gain an upper hand on the peninsula with a nuclear arsenal at its disposal”. That and other launches were “a harbinger of Pyongyang’s aggressive posturing to come next month – with missile launches and a possible nuclear test”, Kim added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T05:56:10Z","webTitle":"Power bill relief all round as major parties launch Victorian election campaigns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","fields":{"bodyText":"Bringing down the cost of power bills was a central theme at both Labor and the Coalition’s Victorian election campaign launches, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, pledging another $250 payment for households, while the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, vowed to temporarily scrap supply charges and reserve new gas supplies. With two weeks of electioneering to go, the first to address party faithful on Sunday was Guy, who announced the Coalition would restrict newly discovered Victorian gas from being exported overseas or interstate. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Victoria must turbocharge gas production and availability – not turn it off,” he told supporters in Port Melbourne. “A guaranteed supply of natural gas means we can keep the lights on and keep energy affordable while we transition to a clean energy future.” Guy acknowledged the plan would “take time to work through the energy market”, so in the interim, the Coalition would cover electricity supply charges on power bills for the first six months of 2023, saving households an estimated $235. “I would have liked to provide this for longer, more than 12 months if we could, but the state of Victoria’s finances after eight long years under Daniel Andrews means we simply can’t afford to do it,” he said. Within an hour, the policy was trumped by Andrews’ announcement that, if Labor is re-elected, each Victorian household that seeks a better power deal will be able to claim another power-saving bonus of $250 off their electricity bills from March 2023. “Private energy companies rely on people not getting the best deal on their power. In fact, they bank on it. It will mean more money in your pocket now plus savings, each year, every year,” Andrews said. “Because that’s the difference – while some value profits, we value people.” Labor’s campaign launch, at the Cranbourne Community Theatre in Melbourne’s south-east, largely focused on its announcement it will revive the publicly-owned State Electricity Commission (SEC). Andrews on Sunday announced 6,000 of the 59,000 jobs expected to be created by the SEC’s revival would be dedicated to apprentices and trainees, while local content requirements on state-owned and supported renewable energy projects – worth at least $5bn by 2035 – will ensure them a “long-term pipeline of work”. “It’s no coincidence that ever since privatisation we’ve seen shortages in so many trades. Our new SEC will help us find the next generation of tradespeople: maintenance workers, lineys, electricians – but also welders, painters and mechanics. Highly-qualified, highly-paid workers – working not for profit, but for people,” he said. Andrews said as part of an overhaul of vocational education, a Tafe course in clean energywill be added to the list of courses subsidised by the government. Students in Year 9 and 10 will also be supported to undergo a week of work experience in the sector, alongside other careers like nursing, trades and early childhood education. A $207m package for the state’s specialist schools was also announced. The package includes the the rollout of after-school care, the creation of dedicated onsite spaces for allied health appointments, more extracurricular activities, therapy animals and software to help non-verbal kids express themselves. Labor will also employ “NDIS navigators” to help families navigate the system, and will offer 1,000 scholarships to allied healthcare workers in regional Victoria. “After nine years of a Liberal government in Canberra, the NDIS is not working,” Andrews said. Former premiers Steve Bracks and John Brumby attended the launch, as well as former ministers James Merlino and Martin Pakula, who announced they were retiring earlier this year. The premier was introduced by wife, Catherine, and children, Noah, Grace and Joseph, and his mother, Jan, was in the crowd. “She’s someone who believes profoundly in the power of connection that every individual that’s held back, holds us all back and that every person who reaches their full potential helps us reach our own,” Andrews said of his mother. The Coalition launch, meanwhile, was attended by Guy’s wife Renee, his sons Joey, Sam and Alex, his parents and in-laws, as well as former premier Ted Baillieu – the last Liberal leader to win an election from opposition, a task Guy described as the “hardest” in politics. “It’s like climbing Mount Everest without oxygen and here in Victoria, Labor have been in government for 19 of the past 23 years, it’s like doing it all in a blizzard – all backwards,” he said. “But for the sake of all those people impacted by Daniel Andrews and his world-record lockdowns, we must win this election.” Guy said there was a “growing wave of anger and resentment” against the premier in the state that makes him “more and more confident” that the Coalition will win the election. The state goes to the polls on 26 November, with early voting beginning on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T12:32:18Z","webTitle":"The march on Rome and Mussolini’s ascent to power – archive, October 1922","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","fields":{"bodyText":"Italy in fascist control: swift surrender of the government 30 October 1922 At the moment when Mussolini, the leader of the Italian fascisti, was seizing control of the country by force, the government’s authority has been placed in his hands by the king, who yesterday asked him to form a cabinet. On Saturday, while Mussolini ordered a general mobilisation of his more or less armed force of nearly half a million men, the cabinet decided upon measures of resistance – with certain reservations. The military were ordered to hold Rome against attack, but to give some latitude to the revolutionaries in the provinces. Martial law was ordered to be proclaimed throughout the country from midday on Saturday, but before the day was out the order was rescinded. The situation had become too bad for remedy, and the king, recognising this, refused to sign the decree. Continue reading. Editorial: The fascist triumph 30 October 1922 Signor Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, has been invited to form a government. If an English political leader of any party organised armed followers throughout the country and on the occasion of a cabinet crisis ordered a “general mobilisation” and seized government offices in the important towns, so that Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands were under his control, and if under threat of war the King were to invite him to form a government of his own, we might congratulate ourselves, as they appear to be doing in Italy, that this military occupation had been achieved “without disorder,” and we might call the “solution of the crisis” by any names we chose, but we should in reality have submitted to revolution. Continue reading. Foreign 31 October 1922 Signor Mussolini, the leader of the Italian fascists, after an interview with King Victor at the Quirinal yesterday, assumed the premiership and formed a cabinet. He himself has taken over the ministries of the interior and foreign affairs, while appointing seven other fascists to office. Editorial: a bloodless revolution 31 October 1922 The part of an English observer of the Italian crisis is at the moment to study it in a spirit of sympathy for Italy, for the nation as a whole, not for a section of it. If the triumph of Signor Mussolini, the fascist leader, is confirmed, it will have reactions of an unknown extent on international affairs and, therefore, on British interests and policy. But that may wait. At present we are concerned rather to understand what has been happening and why it is that the fascists, who at the Armistice did not exist, have now overthrown constitutional government by threat of force, impelled the King to reject the advice of his ministers, and established themselves in power. We may congratulate Italy that she has so far escaped bloodshed. The discipline of the fascists has been good, their success in the occupation of important towns was immediate, and the action of the King perhaps averted what chance there was of civil war. Office and responsibility are apt to exercise a sobering influence on un-sober minds, and some utterances are already attributed to the new Premier which suggest that he may pursue a policy more moderate than the speeches he has sometimes made. That remains to be seen. Meanwhile we may as well begin by recognising what has happened in Italy. Signor Mussolini has been victorious by a coup d’état, by the exercise of unconstitutional violence. A London newspaper, referring to the failure of the communists since their seizure of the factories last year, remarks that “the policy of Direct Action has been utterly discomfited.” It has, of course, been completely successful. The quality of Direct Action does not depend on whether one likes either the methods or the noses of one particular section of Direct Actionists. Signor Mussolini has used extra-legal means to impose his government on the country. He is as good a constitutionalist as Lenin, and no more. Of Mussolini’s policy the little that is known is not encouraging. At home the mainspring of the movement has been anti-socialism, which has taken the form of destroying the property of socialist institutions and ejecting socialist officials from the posts to which they had been legally elected. If this method should be elevated into a principle of government by a ministry founded upon a threat of war, “force begets force” will be its epitaph. Abroad they proclaim a flamboyant nationalist policy of the sort for which no other people has had much stomach since the war. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Anxiety in Paris From our own correspondent 31 October 1922 Paris, Monday News of the fascist coup d’état has been received here with mistrust and alarm. Those conservatives who admired fascism and attempted to preach the necessity of such an institution for France as a defence against the bugbear of socialism are ill at ease. The Liberté which only a few months ago published a series of laudatory articles on Signor Mussolini’s society, to-day says:- “Benito Mussolini, an ex-socialist turned patriot, an avowed republican and a politician ambitious for Caesar’s laurels, has commenced an era of great adventures which will forge the future history of Italy. With sincere friendship for our Roman sister, let us hope that he may not prove the Lafayette of the great revolution that is beginning.” The Temps, which is more discreet, grieves over the lack of respect for constitutional methods. “Wreckage may churn up foam, but it is wind itself that moves the sea,” it adds. Diplomats in Paris are dismayed at this “new woe”, while Italians in Paris are depressed. It seems to be generally held that Mussolini has no real programme, and it is feared he may resort to war or threaten war against Jugo-Slavia to keep his followers together. Criticisms are levelled against the King of Italy for his action in yielding to the fascists and refusing to support the ministry. Naturally socialists and communists here have exhausted their vocabulary of abuse against Mussolini “and his band of turbulent schoolboys and blackleg workmen”. A new and incalculable factor in the already fearfully difficult European situation has appeared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/31/northern-ireland-power-sharing-system-not-fit-for-purpose-says-irish-pm-micheal-martin","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T15:20:54Z","webTitle":"Northern Ireland power-sharing system not fit for purpose, says Irish PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/31/northern-ireland-power-sharing-system-not-fit-for-purpose-says-irish-pm-micheal-martin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/31/northern-ireland-power-sharing-system-not-fit-for-purpose-says-irish-pm-micheal-martin","fields":{"bodyText":"Ireland’s prime minister has said the system of sharing power between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland is no longer fit for purpose and should be reviewed. Micheál Martin’s remarks come amid claims the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) wants to delay a new Stormont assembly election as long as possible to give talks over the disputed Brexit protocol a chance to take off. The system, which imposes a mandatory coalition of representation from the two communities, was devised 24 years ago as part of the Good Friday agreement under which paramilitaries on both sides swapped the bullet for the ballot box. Recently, there have been complaints that it is out of step with the evolution of regional politics and does not give equal power to all parties. On Monday, the taoiseach said after more than two decades it may no longer reflect the needs of the community, as other parties – including the neutral Alliance party, now the third biggest in the country – have gained ground. “There’s a reason why all this [power sharing] came in, in the early years,” Martin said in an interview with the Financial Times. “There is room for the parties to look at changing the system. The system does polarise and it is not fit for purpose …  The electoral system should not be one that constantly reinforces polarisation.” The 1998 peace deal established a power-sharing system based on a consociational model of democracy designed by the political scientist Arend Lijphart for societies emerging from conflict. Under the rules, key decisions must have the backing of unionist and nationalist parties, with no explicit support required from an emerging third party. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, said earlier this year that the party’s emergence as one of the largest in Northern Ireland had raised questions over power-sharing structures. Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance party, welcomed the taoiseach’s remarks, tweeting that there should be an option for a “cross-community coalition for the willing”. Martin’s remarks come as Northern Ireland faces another hiatus in the power-sharing system owing to a boycott by the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in a row over the Northern Ireland protocol. After the DUP failed to agree to return to the assembly’s executive by a deadline of last Friday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, announced there would be fresh elections. But he declined to name a date, fuelling speculation Rishi Sunak could yet sanction emergency legislation to delay an election. On Monday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson indicated there may not be any update this week. “I’m not aware of any plans for that [an update] during those visits. The rules are the date needs to be announced as soon as reasonably practicable. But I don’t have an update for you.” It is understood that the Northern Ireland Office is pushing for as early an election as possible but others in London think that a later election, possibly in January, could give talks over the protocol a better chance. None of the political parties support an election, fearing campaigning will do little to change the deadlock since the previous poll in May and will further polarise communities at a time of a national cost of living crisis. Heaton-Harris will be in Belfast on Tuesday to hold talks with Stormont party leaders and will meet the Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, later in the week. One source said the FCDO, which is leading on the talks with the EU over the protocol, was keen to delay the election as long as possible. Given the results could be similar to those in May, they say it would be unhelpful to have all sides dig in, further politicising the talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/06/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-nuclear-weapons-report","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T01:58:30Z","webTitle":"FBI found document on foreign nuclear defenses at Mar-a-Lago – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/06/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-nuclear-weapons-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/06/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-nuclear-weapons-report","fields":{"bodyText":"The FBI recovered a document describing a foreign government’s nuclear capabilities during its search of Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. The Post, citing unnamed sources, did not identify the foreign government named in the document describing the country’s military defenses. The content of the more than 11,000 government documents and photographs FBI agents recovered from Donald Trump’s Florida estate last month has not been revealed, but previous reporting from the Post indicated classified documents about nuclear weapons were among the items federal authorities were looking for. Some of the records seized from Donald Trump’s Florida estate are typically closely guarded, the newspaper reported, and have “a designated control officer” to monitor the documents’ location. Among the records recovered by the FBI were documents detailing top-secret US operations that require special clearances “on a need-to-know basis”, beyond a top-secret clearance, according to the Post report. Some of the Biden administration’s most senior national security officials were not authorized to review some of the documents because they are so restricted, the Post said. Trump is under investigation by the justice department for his unauthorized removal of highly sensitive government records from the White House and for allegedly improperly storing them at Mar-a-Lago. The findings are the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that began when US government agents conducted an unprecedented search of the former president’s Florida home. Trump has attacked the department, including at a weekend rally where he called the FBI and DoJ “vicious monsters”. Many others, including Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have defended the investigation into his retention of government records, saying that it posed a major national security risk. A federal judge recently granted Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master to review the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago on 8 August. The decision by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, temporarily prevented the justice department from reviewing records for its criminal inquiry until after the the special master’s review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-12T17:25:34Z","webTitle":"Porter and Smith power England’s seven-try return to form against Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"Eddie Jones so nearly got his wish. For it was not until the late stages of this emphatic victory that a few Mexican waves began to ripple around the Twickenham stands. By that stage England had long since put a disappointing Japan side to the sword and demonstrated a dominance to both kickstart their autumn campaign and look forward to the sterner tests that await with relish. England were true to their word, slipped the straitjackets and played with more freedom of expression than six days previous against Argentina. Jones had promised that the focus in the buildup was all about this fixture rather than the World Cup – perhaps he is on to something – and a performance that would keep the Mexican waves at bay. That England almost achieved it aptly sums up their afternoon – not perfect, but significantly more polished. England set about their task with an intensity that Japan could not live with. They ran in seven tries, injected the pace that the selections of Jack van Poortvliet, Sam Simmonds and Jonny May suggested they would and ruled the skies to ensure Japan could feed off only scraps. They were far more disciplined, too, giving away just six penalties but the frustration is that it takes a defeat to bring about this sort of response from England and it must also be said that this is a fixture Jones’ side could never countenance losing, however much Japan have kicked on since they were last here four years ago. The All Blacks, due next Saturday, will be a different proposition, so too South Africa seven days later so call this a launchpad from which England head into those fixtures. As was the case when England last took to the field after a defeat, it was Ellis Genge who set the tone. He may have given a penalty away for being offside, overeager, but he won three at the scrum early on and where he leads, England follow. Japan could not escape the suffocating net that was England’s defence, there was a hurriedness rather than a fluidity to their handling, and Genge and co continued to turn the screw. Again England had plenty of the ball but this week there was more conviction to what they did with it. Van Poortvliet served Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell with quick ball and both were willing to use it rather than kick it away. England managed three first-half tries, the first a clever strike move finished by Freddie Steward. England’s maul was going sideways but Van Poortvliet sparked a move through the hands of Farrell and Smith and on to Steward, who evaded Kotaro Matsushima to dash over in the corner. Farrell added a penalty and in an illustration of England’s intent, he could be heard asking the referee Jamie Doleman if they could play advantage on the back of their scrum dominance. Steward then turned provider with a mazy run from deep before offloading to Van Poortvliet who fed Joe Cokanasiga, a late replacement for the injured Jack Nowell. He was shackled by Takuya Yamasawa but had the wherewithal to pop the ball up for Smith to score in the corner. Guy Porter added a third after Simmonds put his first England try on a plate just before the interval – the home side taking May’s yellow card in their stride. May had been sent to the sin-bin after a rare counterattack from Japan, led by Michael Leitch and continued by the impressive Dylan Riley with the England wing having to scramble – illegal in the eyes of Doleman. Japan opted to kick at goal, as they had done a few minutes earlier when well-placed, seemingly a tacit acknowledgement of England’s defensive might. Genge added the try his performance deserved soon after the restart by battering his way to the line after concerted England pressure and Porter had his second by showing a deceptive turn of pace to collect Farrell’s left-footed grubber with one-handed passes from the two locks, Jonny Hill and David Ribbans, in the buildup. Just as England were looking a touch too comfortable, Warner Dearns broke free from a ruck and teed up Naoto Saito for Japan’s only try before a flurry of replacements took the sting out of the match. A penalty try for England – for which Siosaia Fifita was sent to the sin-bin – and another for Smith put the gloss on the scoreline, Farrell adding the conversion to complete a flawless match from the tee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-14T16:52:26Z","webTitle":"The power of collective grief in this time of change | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","fields":{"bodyText":"Marina Hyde highlights the unpredictability of mass grief and how those at the centre of power can be unnerved by spontaneous public emotions (Britain could plan for the Queen’s death – but not for the risky tides of public feeling, 9 September). This observation is fair enough in so far as it goes. But we need to look into the nature of the events that inspire such emotions, rather than at the emotions themselves. The Queen’s death marks a transition between two stable states: that of her own long reign and that of the reign of her son, Charles, that has now begun. Events over the past few days are designed to create stability in an otherwise unstable liminal phase that will last until King Charles’s coronation. The rituals that we have been witnessing are designed to avoid the potential disruption that all such rites of passage make possible (hence the repetition of words such as tradition and history). The royal family is acutely aware of the potential threat to its hitherto accepted right to reign over the UK and various Commonwealth countries. Like all liminal personae, its members behave in a passive or humble manner, obeying their unseen instructors’ commands. They must be seen to be doing the right thing. It is in such moments that “communitas” (Hyde’s “mass anything”) is often born – witness one woman giving the new king a kiss in front of Buckingham Palace. But communitas can also emerge as an opposing force (the response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, for example). This is what those in power are afraid of and do their utmost to prevent. Prof Brian Moeran Moretonhampstead, Devon • Marina Hyde is wrong to say that “politicians and many of our institutions are most frightened of the public having emotions”. Has she never been to a party conference or heard a stump speech? At its worst, politics is the pushing of different emotional buttons, found in slogans such as “take back control” and “global Britain”, referencing our (glorious) imperial past. Slogans work because they carry an emotional punch. When exchanging them becomes all that there is, without the backing of policies and real content, then it’s no wonder, as she writes, that 61% of 18- to 34-year-olds consider parliamentary elections to be a bother. The feelings most people are experiencing over the death of a widely respected 96-year-old lady who died peacefully in her favourite place are natural – linked, as all mourning is, to our own mortality. Harold Mozley York • The outburst of mourning after the Queen’s death is precisely the kind of emotion that those in authority would prefer: distracted and entirely passive. The emotion of protest challenges the power of the ruling class. It is an emotion that must be stifled, as the recent police and crime bill showed. The focus on mourning keeps the emotion focused in a way that precludes any challenge to authority. Robert Beavis Bristol • I normally laugh aloud at Marina Hyde’s writing, but her column left me with genuine fear. If the poll she quotes is remotely accurate, and around two-thirds of young people of voting age believe that we need a strong leader unfettered by parliament, then democracy in the UK is certainly in for a hard time. Another unwelcome legacy of the past three years. Alan Whitehouse Barnsley, South Yorkshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Save our nation!” said the Soldier, a brawny marine corps reservist who gave his nom de guerre for fear of being jailed. “We want the armed forces to establish law and order,” agreed the Patriot, a 30-year-old cosmetics saleswoman with similar anxieties about being identified. The pair have been camped outside the base in Boa Vista since 1 November, the day after their radical rightwing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, saw his hopes of a second presidential term dashed in Brazil’s election. Nearly two months later, with the leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva poised to take power, the pair are among thousands of citizens who continue to protest outside military installations across the country, demanding a coup that never comes. “If need be, we’ll stay here for 120 days – or a year. But we will not surrender our homeland,” insisted the Soldier, a 34-year-old former gold miner and marine. “We will not accept this guy as our president,” he said of Lula. “We will never accept this.” With just days until Lula’s inauguration, they would appear to have little choice. On the afternoon of 1 January, the leftist icon, who governed from 2003 to 2010, is due to be formally returned to the presidency at the age of 77. Vans have begun removing Bolsonaro’s belongings from the presidential residence after an anarchic four-year reign during which there were nearly 700,000 Covid deaths and a surge in Amazon destruction. Many progressives have poked fun at the Bolsonarista demos outside military barracks and regional commands, amid some bewildering displays of devotion to Brazil’s outgoing president. At one rally in south Brazil, pro-Bolsonaro militants were filmed singing Brazil’s national anthem to a tyre. Elsewhere, they have been filmed prostrating themselves in prayer or screaming wildly outside special operations bases and engineering units, in the hope of sparking an uprising. Footage of bizarre marching sessions has also been ridiculed on social media. But some experts caution against sneering at the protests, which, while small, suggest the radical grassroots movement energised by Bolsonaro’s presidency is likely to outlive his rule. “It’s cadre formation,” the Duke University Latin America expert John D French said of the pro-Bolsonaro vigils. “They are building a movement.” Consuelo Dieguez, a journalist who has written a book about Brazil’s burgeoning right, said she had initially been one of those giggling at the eccentric demonstrations of allegiance to Bolsonaro from predominantly elderly supporters. “At first I thought it was all rather funny. [I wondered] where have all these lunatics come from?” But as the weeks went by, and the protesters dug in, Dieguez’s amusement turned to distress. “I still think these people are bonkers but I no longer think it’s funny,” she said. Dieguez’s angst stemmed not from the scale of the mobilisations, which involve only a sliver of the 58 million voters who backed Bolsonaro’s failed campaign against Lula. “If all of Bolsonaro’s voters had hit the streets, goodness knows what might have happened to this country … there’d have been a rebellion,” she said. Nor did she see any risk of the military actually staging a pro-Bolsonaro coup d’état. “Bolsonaro’s finished. Everyone’s abandoning him,” she said. What disturbed Dieguez was the level of extremism on show at the rallies. “It’s almost an aberration that you have people in society thinking and acting in such a way. It’s shocking. How did society produce this? How can people be so dissatisfied they feel inclined to stand outside an army barracks asking for military dictatorship? What’s going on? … What happened to our society to produce such radicalised people?” she asked. The risks of such radicalisation exploded into view this month when hardcore Bolsonaristas rampaged through the capital, Brasília, burning buses and cars, in what some saw as an attempt to spark a 6 January-style insurrection. Security has been stepped up to shield Lula and his supporters from similar violence at his swearing-in ceremony. But the Soldier and the Patriot saw nothing radical or anti-democratic about their actions, and denied being “vandals” or “crooks”. “We’re family people … we all feel aggrieved and this is our cry for help so the armed forces come and intervene,” said the Soldier, urging a military junta to seize power to purge Brazilian politics of leftist kleptomaniacs. As the sun beat down on their roadside protest camp, they regurgitated a stream of falsehoods and insinuations about how Bolsonaro was robbed of re-election by fraud-riddled voting machines and tyrannical supreme court judges. “Bolsonaro was the real winner,” the Patriot declared. “We want either a new election or for President Bolsonaro to take charge,” said the Soldier, hailing a “historic” patriotic movement he claimed had attracted 10,000 locals to the gates of the jungle infantry brigade where he stood. On the afternoon the Guardian visited only about a dozen remained, sat on plastic garden chairs and in hammocks and surrounded by banners reading: “Brazil Was Stolen”, “Civil Resistance” and “We fervently want peace”. “It’s ridiculous,” said Dieguez. “But it’s worryingly ridiculous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Back online: the retired gas storage site now able to power 1m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"“Do you hear that?” asks Chris O’Shea, putting a finger in the air and looking out over a tangle of pipes and workers in orange hi-vis overalls. A deep whirr punctures the calm of the east Yorkshire coast, as a huge engine powers up and prepares to suck thousands of cubic metres of gas from deep beneath the North Sea. It is the first time that stored gas from Rough, a vast sandstone reservoir, has been pumped into the grid since 2017. Then, British Gas owner Centrica deemed its storage function “uneconomical”, and the government ignored calls to step in. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its throttling of Europe’s gas supply, has changed all that, and allowed the 37-year-old storage facility to make an unlikely comeback. “I promise this wasn’t staged,” says O’Shea, who is standing on a platform 100ft above the maze of metalwork that is the Easington gas terminal, which sucks the gas from Rough. It is six months since the then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng asked if Centrica could reopen Europe’s largest storage facility. The site, which has only been used to produce local gas for the last five years, is now 20% full, enough to heat about 1m homes. Its reopening means the UK now stores nine days’ worth of gas, up from six, but still the lowest in Europe. Rough has been called into action because of “Dunkelflaute” conditions blanketing northern Europe: barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days. These conditions have thwarted O’Shea’s efforts to fly by helicopter to the Rough platform, 18 miles offshore. He recounts trips offshore in early roles at the oil giant Shell,mistaking a tunafish for a shark on a rig trip in Nigeria. He is dressed in a trademark bright blue hoodie, with “join our Centrica pathway” on the front and “#netzerobattalion” on the back. Blink and you’d miss the millionaire executive with skin in the game of nearly every evolving energy story this week (see: costly bills, Sizewell C, Bulb’s takeover, windfall taxes, power cut frets). The reopening of Rough is a line in the sand for O’Shea, who has championed owning energy generation assets over simply being a retail supplier since taking charge in April 2020, reversing former boss Iain Conn’s strategy. The dash for gas after Russia’s invasion has raised questions as to why Britain has so little gas storage, and why ministers allowed Rough to halt its storage activities. Centrica had decided in 2017 that substantial investment was needed to make it safe at high pressures, with government support, to make it last a further 40 years. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” says O’Shea. “If we knew then what we know now, would it have been a different decision? Possibly.” Storage sites make money by taking in gas when prices are low, typically in the summer, and pumping it back out when prices are high. But the fall in gas prices in recent weeks has meant Centrica has been able to refill relatively cheaply. Investec analysts estimate reopening Rough could be worth as much as £5m a day. Rough sits below the resource-rich southern North Sea, where rigs routinely compete with windfarms and fishing boats for space. The sea is 36m deep, and Rough is 3km below that. A 30km-square sandstone reservoir, it is twice the size of Lake Windemere. It is connected to pipelines via 24 ever-narrowing straws. On the surface is a rig capable of housing more than 100 workers. Despite Britain’s drive to wean itself off fossil fuels, it is viewed as a giant insurance policy for the energy network. Executives argue its mere presence as part of the gas network “takes the froth” off prices. Centrica says it could have saved customers £2.4bn, or £88 each, last winter had it been active then. The FTSE 100 firm has funded this winter’s call to action, but O’Shea wants government support to secure its future. He estimates it would cost £150m to double its capacity to 60bn cubic feet by next winter. Longer-term, £1bn is needed to ramp up its methane capacity, and £2bn to fit the toughened steel needed for what Centrica hopes will be its next stage of life: the world’s largest hydrogen storage facility. The refit could take five to seven years if it is kept open during the work. “In order to invest, companies need to understand they can make a return and at the moment there is no confirmed model for hydrogen. We don’t need any government money and have never asked. We’re looking for the right regulatory framework,” he says. O’Shea hopes a “cap and floor” model guaranteeing revenues in tough times and returning windfall profits to taxpayers can be created for hydrogen. Is the current focus on gas obscuring the need to focus on green energy? “I think that long-term security of supply and decarbonisation can actually be complementary. They’re not mutually exclusive,” he says. He argues hydrogen is vital for decarbonising industrial Humberside and Teesside – the worst polluting areas of the UK and home to sites such as Scunthorpe steelworks. Entering Easington, it is easy to see the hallmarks of state ownership (British Gas was privatised under Margaret Thatcher in 1986). Over the fence lie the assets separated off in privatisation, now with fellow FTSE 100 company National Grid, that handle gas from Norway and the North Sea. On the wall, a projection shows the live status of each piece of machinery from the “pig tray” (a big bowling ball that squeezes liquid out of the pipeline) to the “slug catcher”, which helps further purify the methane. Ministers hope Rough’s extra supplies can complement other measures to reduce pressure on the energy supplies this winter – from putting coal plants on standby to National Grid incentivising firms and consumers to cut energy usage. The British Gas pilot of this scheme launches on Thursday. Called Peak Save, consumers with smart meters can receive about £4 for every unit of electricity they save compared with their normal usage. About 100,000 households are likely to participate and could save £100 between December and March, it estimates. “This approach to help manage residential electricity demand is likely to become a major feature of the market in years to come,” O’Shea says. The Scotsman neatly packs away his personalised overalls and tucks a can of Irn-Bru into his jeans pocket, before heading off to tackle whatever the energy crisis has to throw at him next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-03T14:00:46Z","webTitle":"Midwinter magic: Robert Macfarlane on the enduring power of The Dark Is Rising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","fields":{"bodyText":"I first read Susan Cooper’s The Dark Is Rising the summer I turned 13, the year the Berlin Wall came down. I read it by torchlight under the bedclothes, not because of parental curfew or power cut, but because that seemed the safest place to read what was, unmistakably, the eeriest novel I’d ever met. Eeriness is different in kind to horror. Eeriness thrives in edge-of-the-eye glimpses; horror is full-frontal. The eerie lives in the same family of feelings as Freud’s “uncanny”, which in its original German, unheimlich, means “unhomely”. A core power of Cooper’s novel lies in its counterpointing of the homely and the unhomely. It opens in the domestic clamour of the Stanton family house, in a quiet English village in the upper Thames valley. It’s 20 December: the eve of both the winter solstice and the 11th birthday of Will, the youngest of the Stanton children. Inside the house, all is pre-Christmas chaos, baking smells and familiarity. But in the wintry landscape around, something is very wrong. Rooks are behaving strangely, dogs are suddenly afraid of Will, a blizzard is coming, and “a shadowy awareness of evil” is building. Will’s life is about to change for ever – for he will become caught up in an ancient battle between the forces of the Light and those of the Dark, which are always strongest at midwinter. His young shoulders are soon to bear an immense burden. The Dark Is Rising sank deep into my bones. Its characters – tall Merriman, capable of such warmth and such wrath; the Lady with her leitmotif of haunting, ethereal music; wise young Will; horned Herne – leapt into my imagination, and have never left. I was also deeply influenced by Cooper’s sense of landscape as a memory-shaping, time-slipping medium, present more widely in the tradition of Anglo-American fantasy fiction that runs from John Masefield’s The Box of Delights, through Alan Garner, Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea books, Cooper herself and on to Robert Holdstock and Philip Pullman. Places, in the work of all these writers, carry auras and memories; they act both archivally and prophetically. Landscape is a palimpsest upon which ancient stories are both contested and renewed. Such ideas were powerfully formative for me as a writer, and Cooper’s presence is particularly strong in a book I wrote about walking, paths and history called The Old Ways (there’s a significant “Old Way Lane” in The Dark Is Rising). I know of many other writers and artists, among them Katherine Rundell and Helen Macdonald, for whom Cooper’s work has also been influential. For Max Porter, the series “did more for my imagination, for my vocabulary, for any curiosity or concern I had for Englishness, for history, for listening, than anything I learned at school”; it gave him and his brother “a mythology that we could see and feel around us in rural England, and on our windswept holiday weeks in Snowdonia”. Millions of other readers have met Cooper’s work and never forgotten it. Five years ago, with the poet Julia Bird, I co-ran a midwinter Dark Is Rising reading group on Twitter. Thousands of people joined from dozens of countries. #TheDarkIsReading trended nationally on Twitter, and the online outpouring of affection for the book was immense. This winter, I hope The Dark Is Rising will find new audiences around the world. For, working with the actor, director and theatre-maker Simon McBurney, and supported by Complicité (the theatre company that Simon co-founded) I’ve spent the past year adapting The Dark Is Rising as an audio drama. It will be broadcast first on BBC World Service in 12 episodes, beginning on 20 December, with an episode following each day, such that the broadcasts correspond to the “real time” of the novel’s own unfolding across the solstice, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. I gave a copy of The Dark Is Rising to Simon back in 2017, when I realised he’d never heard of it. Simon read it aloud to his son, Teyo. Then he read it aloud to Teyo for a second time. Then he and Complicité developed the idea of adapting it, and I jumped at their invitation of involvement. It made immediate sense to me to translate The Dark Is Rising into sound. For this is a novel, far more than most, to which one listens with the mind’s ear as well as seeing in the mind’s eye. Its soundscape is deeply complex; brimful of noises, melodies, songs and chants. Speaking aloud is crucial within it: words hold force when given voice – you must watch what you say. It’s long been a puzzle to me that there aren’t more adaptations of Cooper’s novels (the book we’ve adapted is the second in a five-novel series, usually referred to as the Dark Is Rising sequence). There was an American film “version” in 2007, so appalling that I and all true Cooper fans refuse to speak its name. A radio adaptation for BBC Children’s Radio 4, 25 years ago. Other than that, nothing I knew of. Early in the process of adaptation, in discussion with Complicité’s brilliant producer Tim Bell, Simon and I resolved on four creative principles. First, that we would honour Cooper’s novel and its 50-year-long power of enchantment. Second, that we’d make something far more ambitious than “just” an abridged reading of the book; third, that the supernatural elements of the production would be recorded binaurally, to immerse the listener acoustically; and fourth, that we’d draw out the transnational nature of Cooper’s vision. For the “Old Ones” – the warriors of the Light – are drawn from every country and background, and it is a Jamaican Old One who gives to Will an object of immense power, without which his quest cannot be completed. It feels right to us that this adaptation will be broadcast on the World Service, and heard in nearly 90 countries. Working with Simon on the adaptation was inspirational; a 12-month masterclass in the skills of narrative pacing, dramatic tempo and creative perfectionism. As well as co-adapting the text with me, Simon also directed the performances and voiced the narrator. Complicité slowly gathered a superb cast including Toby Jones, Harriet Walter, Miles Yekinni as Herne, Natasha K Stone as the “devil-girl” Maggie Barnes, and 13-year-old Noah Alexander, who plays young Will Stanton. Though it’s structured around a Manichean opposition of Light and Dark, Cooper’s novel refuses to cleave into neat binaries. I think of it, in fact, as a cold war novel, first published in 1973 and kindred in its moral complexities to early Le Carré; describing a conflict fought in the shadows, in which no one is clean. At its heart is the relationship between the central Old One, Merriman (played by Paul Rhys in our adaptation), and his “liege man” Hawkin (played by Toby Jones). Merriman must have a splinter of ice in his heart to do what he does to Hawkin. “This is a cold battle we are in,” Merriman tells Will, chillingly, “and we must sometimes do cold things.” At the novel’s core is a hard question: when the dark comes rising, who will turn it back? Susan Cooper was born in Buckinghamshire in 1935. When I met her in the US, she told me how, when the air raid siren sounded during the blitz, her mother would hurry her and her brother down into a nearby bomb shelter. There, by candlelight, she would tell stories to the children to take their minds off the danger. What Cooper recalled – a detail that lifted the hairs on the back of my neck as she told me – was that when the bombs fell, their detonations would cause the candle flame to quiver. The nearer the explosion, the more the flame shook. Boom… shiver…Boom… shiver…Boom! Shiver! People have been telling stories to one another around fires of one kind and another for thousands of years. Cooper learned the power of storytelling in the air raid shelter as bombs fell around her. I first read her books by torchlight, and they helped me cope with the anxiety I felt then at the possibility of nuclear conflict. Now new-old fears – climate chaos, war, ecological collapse – menace our minds. The dark is always rising, and it is the work of the greatest stories to hold it back. The 12-part BBC audio adaption of The Dark Is Rising, commissioned by the World Service, will be broadcast on the World Service from 20 December, and on Radio 4 from 26 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T12:55:20Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear team in Zaporizhzhia limbo as Russia narrows access to plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","fields":{"bodyText":"Uncertainty hangs over the planned visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by a team from the UN nuclear watchdog, as inspectors arrived in Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia city on Wednesday, where they are likely to spend the night before crossing the frontline. The International Atomic Energy Agency mission into Russian-controlled territory, which comprises representatives from countries deemed neutral by both sides, was reportedly intended to last four days. But on Wednesday, the Russian-occupying authorities said the IAEA would be given access for one day. They also said the mission would be expected to join the queue of civilians who cross back and forth between territory controlled by Ukraine and Russia. If that happens, it could delay or disrupt the visit. These potential obstacles come in addition to safety concerns. Ukraine and Russia have given their security guarantees for the mission to travel to the plant and the neighbouring areas, Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said before leaving Kyiv. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, Oleh Nikolenko, wrote on Facebook that Russia must not obstruct the mission’s work at the plant. The facility and the surrounding towns continue to come under shelling. Last week, fighting in and around Europe’s largest nuclear plant damaged vital electricity supplies prompting global concern. Grossi described the mission as “very complex” “We are going to a war zone,” he said. “We are going to occupied territory. And this requires explicit guarantees from not only from the Russians but also from the Republic of Ukraine.” Upon arriving in Zaporizhzhia, Grossi said he and his team were there to conduct a “technical mission” to prevent a nuclear accident. The city council building in the plant’s satellite town of Enerhodar was shelled overnight, according to its mayor-in-exile, Dmytro Orlov. On Monday, the plant, Enerhodar and the nearby Ukrainian-controlled town of Nikopol came under heavy shelling. Grossi said he hoped to establish a permanent mission in Ukraine to monitor the plant. Russia’s representative to the IAEA, Mikhail Ulyanov, said Russia would welcome the establishment of a permanent mission on Wednesday. Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was important for the mission to speak to the plant’s staff and “get the real information, not Russian information”, on what was going on inside the facility. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the mission would spend four days at the plant. But on Wednesday, Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed Zaporizhzhia administration, a Russian-appointed official, was quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying the delegates would be given only one day at the facility. Adding to the suspense, a member of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia administration said the mission would not be given priority and would have to wait in a queue to cross the frontline into the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia province. “The IAEA mission will stand in line to get to the liberated part of the Zaporizhzhia region. This is due to the fact that they will not be issued special passes,” Volodymyr Rogov wrote on Telegram. He wrote that the IAEA could access the plant more easily if they came through Russia. The Zaporizhzhia plant, captured by Russian troops in March but run by Ukrainian staff, is located in a hotspot of a conflict that has settled into a war of attrition fought mainly in eastern and southern Ukraine six months after Russia launched its invasion. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant. Ukraine claims the attacks are false-flag operations carried out by Russia to damage the image of the Ukrainian army; Russia says the attacks are being conducted by Ukraine. The world was on edge last week when fighting cut off electricity supplies to the plant, disconnecting it from the grid for the first time. The plant needs electricity for its cooling rods and security systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster”. A backup electricity supply line kicked in and the plant escaped dangerous overheating. Russia has been poised to hold referendums in the occupied Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions for several months, but battles and attacks continue in the area. Ukrainian forces frequently attack deep inside the occupied territories using western-supplied long-range rockets, and Russian-appointed officials have been targeted in a string of assassinations. Ukraine says it is now conducting offensives with the aim of recapturing the neighbouring Kherson region, which was occupied by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. Ukraine’s military have not released details or evidence of the alleged offensive. Citing Ukrainian and western sources, the Financial Times reported at least part of the aim was to scare Russian troops into fleeing as Ukraine was short of artillery required for a ground offensive. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, told Ukrainian TV the offensive had been successful in three places in the districts of Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka but declined to give further details. Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s offensive had failed along the Mykolaiv-Kriviy Rih frontline. Russia says it shot down three Ukrainian helicopters and that Ukraine had lost four fighter jets during the fighting. Russia is using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as a military base. Ukraine, the US and the UN have called for the facility to be demilitarised. Russia said there were no “ongoing discussions” about demilitarisation, Russia’s Tass news agency reported, citing the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Kyiv was seeking international assistance to try to demilitarise the area. “We think the mission should be a very important step to return the plant to Ukrainian government control by the end of the year,” he told the Associated Press. “We have information that they are now trying to hide their military presence, so they should check all of this.” The European Union’s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, told the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform he hoped the mission would be successful. Speaking at an informal meeting of the EU’s foreign ministers, Borrell criticised Russia for “playing games” with nuclear security and called for the plant to be demilitarised. The US has called for the plant to be shut down. “We continue to believe that a controlled shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactors would be the safest and least risky option in the near-term,” said the White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby.

Chronopharmacology (also known as chronotherapy or circadian medicine) – the idea that a pill popped at exactly the right time has maximum benefit – could be a major influence on the future of medicine. Increasing studies are showing that what time of day we treat disease can be crucial, and that it’s possible to pinpoint the time of day when certain disease is at its worst. In 1997, doctors in Denver split 59 asthmatics into three groups. The first group used steroid inhalers at 8am every day for four weeks. The second used the same inhalers, but much later in the day, at 5.30pm. The third group dosed four times a day at 7am, 12 noon, 7pm and 10pm – at the time, this was believed to be the optimal regime. After a month, the results were in. The 8am group saw the least improvement, while an inhaler at 5.30pm had similar efficacy to one used at regular intervals. In short, taking a drug once was just as effective as taking it four times, provided you took it at the right time of day. Professor David Ray of the University of Oxford uses his own inhaler “at the time when I think it’s going to be most effective” (the exact time is his secret, as “we have to be careful” about single-person anecdotes). As co-director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, the asthmatic professor has conducted his own research into body clocks and the respiratory disease. He also studies how matching medications with our circadian rhythms can improve the effectiveness of drugs. Chronopharmacology is a field filled with jaw-dropping studies to whip out at the pub: in 2011, researchers at the University of Birmingham monitored people who had their influenza jabs in the morning versus those who had them in the afternoon. One month on, the patients who received their vaccination between 9am and 11am had higher levels of anti-flu antibodies than patients jabbed between 3pm and 5pm. Our circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological activity that are regulated by our internal clocks along with external cues, such as light. You sleep at night not just because your mum told you to, but because when your retina detects light it inhibits the production of the hormone melatonin, stimulating wakefulness. Our body temperature varies by as much as half a degree throughout the day: usually, we’re coldest at 4am and hottest just in time for the News at Six. Our hormones, immune cells, and organ functions also fluctuate; mouse livers, for example, grow almost 50% in size during the day before shrinking at night. Many chronobiologists (“chrono” is the Greek word for “time”) believe we should use this information to improve medical interventions. Chronotherapy is an unusual field with both a long and short history. On the one hand, way back in 1698, English physician Sir John Floyer noticed that he had asthmatic fits after sleeping and, therefore, “by late sitting up I have put by the fit for a night or two”. There are also a number of decades-old groundbreaking studies: the Denver asthma report for one, as well as research undertaken in Canada between 1976 and 1991, which found that children given chemotherapy for their leukaemia in the evening had better disease-free survival rates than those treated in the morning. In some areas, timed medicine is already happening, for instance, many doctors prescribe certain statins – drugs for high cholesterol – to be taken at night to correspond with the time when your body produces the most cholesterol. But there is still caution. According to Robert Dallmann, a circadian biologist and biomedical sciences professor at the University of Warwick, the field is in many ways still emerging. “There was, for a long time, a feeling that this was all much too complicated,” he says. While Floyer might have noticed his asthma worsening at night, he wasn’t equipped to know why. “Notice was only really taken once the field started to get to the molecular mechanisms underlying lots of this, because before it was mostly a black box,” Dallmann says. In 2017, the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three American geneticists who had discovered the molecular mechanisms controlling our biological clocks. In layperson’s terms: the scientists had isolated a gene that controls the biological rhythms of fruit flies and found that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates within cells at night and degrades during the day. “I think the nominators could see all this exciting science and see that it hadn’t really translated into the clinic,” says Ray. “We are in a quite exciting time now where there’s a lot of early-phase work showing what massive potential there is here.” Potential, of course, has pitfalls. If scientists discovered that flu vaccinations are more effective in the morning over a decade ago, then why isn’t everyone being jabbed at 9am? Well, first, that would mean the NHS could only issue half as many jabs in a week. Second, it can be hard enough getting people to attend their immunisation appointments at all; limiting them to a narrow window could mean that pregnant women with morning sickness miss their appointment, for example, which is far worse than simply being jabbed in the afternoon. There’s also the fact, Ray says, “that health systems are bureaucratic, they’re under financial pressure. It’s like a supertanker trying to change course.” And, of course, healthcare providers don’t want to jump the gun before enough evidence has accumulated. One 2021 study of 63 healthcare workers in China found that Covid-19 vaccines were more effective when given in the morning. Later that year, a study monitoring 2,190 healthcare workers in the UK found that Covid vaccinations had better efficacy in the afternoon. The vaccinations in both studies were different, but a number of other factors complicate analysis of the results; for example, neither factored in participants’ medication history or sleep and shift-work patterns. Then there’s the matter of funding. For pharmaceutical companies, there are marketing and safety issues when it comes to producing drugs that should be taken at an exact time of day. What are the risks if someone takes it early or late? Already, approximately 30-50% patients with long-term conditions don’t adhere to their medication. But even without new medicine, chronopharmacology can be revolutionary: Ray says the field could “rescue” drugs that have previously failed clinical trials. It’s not uncommon for a drug to be groundbreaking in mice and ineffective in human trials. But in 2020, researchers from Harvard Medical School published a study which found that preventive stroke strategies that had worked in rodents but failed in humans may have done so because rats are nocturnal. Many trials test rats in the daytime, when they’re inactive, and test humans during the day, when they’re active and awake. “They were able to show that a lot of these promising drugs have probably been tested in humans at the wrong time of day,” Ray says. “That’s millions and millions and millions of pounds wasted and all those volunteers recruited and subjected to a trial.” The time of day a drug is administered could also change its side-effects, so drugs that were written off as too toxic could actually be safe within certain parameters. To save money and save lives, Ray argues that many trials should have “clock logic” embedded into them. Let’s say you need to take a drug at 8am for it to be effective, and for whatever reason – needy kids, a hangover, a fundamental disdain for the morning – you can’t. Theoretically, says University of Oxford pharmacology professor Sridhar Vasudevan, you could take one drug to change the timing of another – problem solved. Chronopharmacology isn’t just about matching medicines with your circadian rhythms: it’s also about creating medicine that affects the circadian system itself. Vasudevan became interested in circadian rhythms when he worked in psychiatry more than a decade ago. He noticed that sleep disturbance was prevalent “across the board” in depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. “When something goes wrong in the brain that leads to a mood dysfunction, you have associated sleep dysfunction,” he says. So, Vasudevan theorised, “If you can correct the sleep and circadian dysfunction, you can fix the other side, which is the mood.” In 2016, Vasudevan co-founded a company in the Oxford Centre for Innovation, named Circadian Therapeutics. He and his colleagues are identifying drugs to treat diseases related to circadian rhythm disorders. The team are currently working with blind veterans who have disrupted sleep cycles because light cannot reset their circadian rhythms. “Basically, they’re constantly jet-legged every single day,” Vasudevan says. “The idea is to have a drug that can mimic the effects of light on the brain, so that they can take it once a day and stabilise their sense of time.” Circadian Therapeutics are also developing drugs to help those with neurodegenerative disorders. “Sundowning” is a phenomenon whereby some people with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s become distressed and confused in the late afternoon. Vasudevan is looking into circadian modulators that could manage these symptoms. Of course we shouldn’t just manipulate our body clocks for the sake of it, as Vasudevan warns that taking one newly discovered drug to affect the timing of another could “introduce extra risk”. Still, there’s potential. “If the ideal time for you to take a drug is between 1am and 4am, most people are not going to wake up to take it,” Vasudevan says, “and sleep is extremely important in the healing process, regardless of what you’re recovering from.” In some circumstances – at some point in the future – taking one drug to change your circadian timing could help another drug work better. Drugs are not the only route to a healthy life. Chrono-nutrition and chrono-exercise are exactly what they sound like. In October 2021, a study from Harvard Medical School found that eating earlier affects the speed at which you burn calories and store fat – in short, the exact same meal could be far healthier eaten at 5pm than 9pm. In May, academics from Skidmore College in New York found that women who exercised in the morning burned more abdominal fat and reduced their blood pressure more than women who exercised in the evening – but, the later exercisers had “enhanced muscular performance”. Before you start swallowing 10am pills and going on 3pm jogs, it’s important to remember that our internal circadian biology does vary: some of us are morning people and some of us are evening people (this characteristic is known as a chronotype). Ray says your chronotype is affected by your age, gender and genes, and argues that in the future we’ll likely see personalised chronopharmacology based on “the clock phase of the person, rather than just going off the time on the clock on the wall”. Dallmann, who runs the Patho-Physiological Molecular Clocks Lab at Warwick University, has already used his research to work out what personally works for him. “I do implement some of the current knowledge on time-restricted eating,” he says, “and I choose my painkillers differently by time of day.” Still, it’s important to remember that for many medicines, the time of day they’re taken doesn’t matter at all. As Ray says: “If the disease you are targeting doesn’t change by time of day then it doesn’t matter what time of day you give the drug.” If a drug has a long half-life (ie it takes weeks for the substance to reduce by half in your body), then the time of day it’s taken doesn’t matter, because its concentration remains consistent. Sceptical scientists have also warned about being too enthusiastic. University of North Carolina biochemist Aziz Sancar has argued that when it comes to cancer, chrono-chemotherapy researchers have overstated positive findings and generalised from small studies in the past. But for now and for many, chronopharmacology remains emerging and exciting. “We have to be careful about overselling it. It can lead to dissatisfaction if you cry wolf,” says Ray. However, “We’re at that point where it’s exciting,” and people are increasingly aware of the field. “We’ve done focus groups with patients,” Ray says, “and as soon as you say: ‘We’d really like to hear your views about timing and how the time of day affects your disease,’ they’re over the moon – because, finally, someone is listening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/25/us-russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-weapons-jake-sullivan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T14:53:40Z","webTitle":"Jake Sullivan: US will act ‘decisively’ if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/25/us-russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-weapons-jake-sullivan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/25/us-russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-weapons-jake-sullivan","fields":{"bodyText":"America and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday, reaffirming the Joe Biden White House’s previous response to mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin’s threats are in increased danger of being realized. “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,” Sullivan told CBS’s Face the Nation. Sullivan said that the Russian leader had been “waving around the nuclear card at various points through this conflict”, and it was a matter that Biden’s administration has “to take deadly seriously because it is a matter of paramount seriousness – the possible use of nuclear weapons for the first time since the second world war”. In a separate interview with CBS, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was not certain that Putin was bluffing with nuclear threats. “Maybe yesterday it was bluff. Now, it could be a reality,” he said. “He wants to scare the whole world.” The administration’s security chief said that Russia’s nuclear threat against Ukraine, including extending its nuclear umbrella over eastern parts of the country that are still being contested seven months after its invasion, would not deflect the US and its allies. “We will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its country and defend its democracy,” Sullivan said, pointing to more than $15bn in weapons, including air defense systems, hundreds of artillery pieces and rounds of artillery, that the US has supplied to Ukraine. He said that Moscow’s mobilization of troops and “sham referenda in the occupied regions” would not deter the US. “What Putin has done is not exactly a sign of strength or confidence – frankly, it’s a sign that they’re struggling badly on the Russian side,” Sullivan said. But, Sullivan added, it is “too soon to make comprehensive predictions” about a collapse of Russian forces. “I think what we are seeing are signs of unbelievable struggle among the Russians – you’ve got low morale, where the soldiers don’t want to fight. And who can blame them because they want no part of Putin’s war of conquest in their neighboring country?” Sullivan continued: “Russia is struggling, but Russia still remains a dangerous foe, and capable of great brutality.” He alluded to mass burial sites containing hundreds of graves that Ukrainian forces found after recapturing Izium from Russia and said, “We continue to take that threat seriously.” He added that the US, the International Atomic Agency and Ukraine nuclear regulators were working together to ensure there is no “meltdown” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in eastern Ukraine. The Russians, he said, had been “consistently implying that there may be some kind of accident at this plant”. Reactors at the plant, Sullivan said, had been put into “cold storage” to “try to make sure there is no threat posed by a melt-down or something else at the plant. But it’s something we all have to keep a close eye on.” Separately, Sullivan said US criticism of a crackdown on mounting protests in Iran after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini would not affect the administration’s offer to lift sanctions on Iran as part of the effort to reach a deal on nuclear enrichment. “The fact that we are in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program is in no way impacting our willingness and our vehemence in speaking out about what has been happening on the streets of Iran,” he said. Last week, Biden told the general assembly of the United Nations in New York that “we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights”. The US president’s remarks came shortly after a defiant speech by Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi. In his remarks on Sunday, Sullivan said the US had taken “tangible steps” to sanction the morality police who caused the death of Mahsa Amini. “We’ve taken steps to make it easier for Iranians to be able to get access to the internet and communications technologies to talk to one another and talk to the world and we will do all that we can to support the brave people, the brave women, of Iran,” Sullivan said. But Sullivan refused to be drawn out on whether the US would change its policy on lifting sanctions in exchange for a nuclear deal in light of the protests. “We’re talking about diplomacy to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon,” he said. “If we … succeed … the world, America and its allies will be safer.” But the pursuit of a nuclear deal, Sullivan said, “would not stop us in any way from pushing back and speaking out on Iran’s brutal repression of its citizens and its women. We can and will do both.” • This article was amended on 27 September 2022 because Jake Sullivan referred to Russia’s mobilization of troops and the “sham referenda in the occupied regions”, not that the mobilization of troops “was a ‘sham referenda … ’” as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-ex-bosses-of-owner-tepco-ordered-to-pay-yen-13tn-tokyo-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-13T11:28:53Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear disaster: ex-bosses of owner ordered to pay ¥13tn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-ex-bosses-of-owner-tepco-ordered-to-pay-yen-13tn-tokyo-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-ex-bosses-of-owner-tepco-ordered-to-pay-yen-13tn-tokyo-court","fields":{"bodyText":"A court in Japan has ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) to pay ¥13tn (£80bn) in damages for failing to prevent a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011. The ruling by Tokyo district court centred on whether senior Tepco management could have predicted a serious nuclear accident striking the facility after a powerful tsunami. Four defendants, including Tepco’s president at the time of the disaster, Masataka Shimizu, were ordered to pay the sum, while a fifth was not found liable for damages, according to the Kyodo news agency. The plant in Fukushima, 150 miles north of Tokyo, experienced meltdowns in three of its six reactors after it was struck by a tsunami on 11 March 2011, flooding the backup generators. The tsunami, which was triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake, killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. The meltdowns at Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl 25 years earlier, caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of who have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2012 by 48 Tepco shareholders, is the first to find company executives liable for damages connected to the Fukushima disaster, which shook Japan’s faith in nuclear energy and resulted in widespread closures of atomic power plants. The plaintiffs had sought a record ¥22tn in damages. The executives found liable are unlikely to have the capacity to pay the full amount, according to media reports, but will be expected to pay as much as their assets allow. Tepco did not comment on the ruling, saying it would not respond to individual lawsuits, according to Kyodo. The court said the company’s countermeasures against tsunami “fundamentally lacked safety awareness and a sense of responsibility”. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck in March 2011, and that it had done everything possible to protect the plant. But an internal company document revealed in 2015 that it had been aware of the need to improve the facility’s defences against tsunami more than two years before the disaster, but had failed to take action. Plaintiffs also cited a government report that showed Tepco had predicted in June 2008 that the Fukushima plant could be hit by tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres in height after a major offshore earthquake. The court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures.

Or self-coup to be exact. The world watched its denouement dumbfounded on 6 January 2021 as thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the heart of US democracy, the Capitol in Washington, with cries to hang the vice-president, in an attempt to overturn an election and keep Trump in power. But, as the detailed executive summary of the report released by the congressional committee investigating the insurrection lays bare, Trump’s bid to usurp power began while the votes from the November 2020 presidential election were still being counted. That kicked off what amounted to a rolling coup attempt as an increasingly desperate president sought to compromise and corrupt officials from the US justice department to state election boards in an effort to find a way, any way, to have his defeat declared null and void. The seeds were sown by Trump as he watched the results roll in on election night. The president’s own campaign manager, Bill Stepien, had told him that the way the count was conducted in several states meant that early results were likely to give Trump the lead but that would be eroded as absentee and other postal votes were tallied. The count panned out as Stepien predicted and Trump’s aides cautioned the president that, for all his euphoria at the prospect of pulling off another astonishing upset, it was way too soon to be declaring victory. But all Trump saw was his numbers go up and then down. He brushed off his advisers and went on television. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election,” he declared. The following morning, Trump inevitably used Twitter to demand that the results already declared, and showing him ahead, be frozen: “STOP THE COUNT!” The report notes that almost none of Trump’s aides supported his claims, with the exception of the increasingly erratic former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But that fed the narrative pushed by the president and his supporters that he was the victim of an establishment conspiracy. By the time the electoral college met on 14 December to cast and certify each state’s votes, many of Trump’s senior staff, cabinet secretaries and even members of his family, were pressing him to admit defeat. The president preferred to listen to Giuliani’s conspiratorial claims that the voting machines were rigged and suitcases of fake ballots had been used to tip the result against him. As Trump grew more desperate, he pressured Republican officials in key swing states he had lost to overturn the results. In early January, he called Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to demand he “find 11,780 votes” to reverse Joe Biden’s crucial victory in the state. “Trump also made a thinly veiled threat to Raffensperger and his attorney about his failure to respond to Trump’s demands: ‘That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense … That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer … I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen,’” the report said. In Arizona, Trump targeted the Republican speaker of the state legislature, Russell “Rusty” Bowers. The president and Giuliani repeatedly called or met with Bowers to claim that Arizona’s results were fraudulent and to press him to replace the state’s members of the electoral college with ones who would vote for Trump. Bowers told Giuliani: “You are asking me do something against my oath, and I will not break my oath.” Trump exerted similar pressure on officials in Michigan, which he had won in 2016 but lost four years later. The president was pursuing a parallel track with the US justice department. The attorney general, William Barr, grew so exasperated with Trump’s actions that he resigned. The president called or met with Barr’s replacement, Jeff Rosen, nearly every day of the following weeks in an attempt to pressure the justice department “to find factual support for his stolen election claims and thereby to assist his efforts to reverse election results”, according to the report. When Rosen repeatedly told Trump that there was no evidence for the allegations, Trump replied: “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.” When this didn’t fly either, Trump turned to those he could always trust: the men and women in the red Make America Great Again caps. As he saw it, the “deep state” was working to rob him of his rightful victory. Trump would count on the people to save him. And so the president summoned the faithful to Washington for a rally on January 6, the day his vice-president, Mike Pence, was to preside over a joint meeting of both houses of Congress to count and approve the electoral college votes, a routine affair for much of the US’s existence. Trump’s efforts to pressure states to withhold their tallies in the hope of delaying the endorsement of Biden’s victory had come to naught and a wave of court challenges to the results failed. Pence made clear to Trump that he would fulfil his duty and that the president’s days in the White House were numbered. Trump told the world a different story. On the evening of 5 January, he released a statement falsely claiming that his vice-president was “in total agreement” with him that Pence had the power to prevent endorsement of the results by “sending them back” to the states. In the early hours of the following morning, Trump tweeted: “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect &amp; even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!” Pence did not agree and, astonishingly, refused to take his own president’s call on the morning of the rally. When Trump finally reached his vice-president by phone, the president called him “a wimp” for refusing to block Congress from approving Biden’s victory. The crowd that arrived for the Washington rally was already stoked by weeks of Trump’s tweets and conspiratorial claims bolstered by Fox News and other rightwing broadcasters. The committee’s report noted that far-right militia groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters were also instrumental in spreading the false claims of fraud. “President Trump’s supporters believed the election was stolen because they listened to his words, and they knew what he had called them to do; stop the certification of the electoral count,” the report said. It noted that supporters tweeted messages ahead of the rally predicting what would happen. “IF TRUMP TELLS US TO STORM THE FUKIN CAPITAL IMA DO THAT THEN!” said one. Others circulated flyers proclaiming “#OccupyCongress” over images of the Capitol. The report records that the intelligence services had wind of all of this, and warned the president and his staff. Some of Trump’s aides urged him to make a public statement disavowing violence. The president refused. His speech on January 6 instead made clear who he regarded as the real villain of the moment. As the congressional report recorded, Trump told the assembled crowd: “Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country.” The president added a veiled threat: “If you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.” The report records the reaction of Trump supporters at the rally. “I’m telling you, if Pence caved, we’re going to drag motherfuckers through the streets. You fucking politicians are going to get fucking drug through the streets,” said one. And then the mob headed Pence’s way. The report concluded that the Proud Boys militia led the attack on Congress. “Multiple Proud Boys reacted immediately to President Trump’s December 19th tweet and began their planning,” it said. Someone erected an imitation gallows in front of the Capitol. As the mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence”, the vice-president fled his office near the Senate chamber but refused to leave the building. The protesters passed within 40ft. Pence was not the only target. The report records that one woman was looking for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, “to shoot her in the frigging brain”. By the time the crowd broke through the barriers around the Capitol, beating police officers with flag poles and smashing their way into the corridors of Congress, Trump was back in the White House. Alarmed aides pleaded with him to make a call to stop the violence. Trump instead sent out yet another tweet denouncing Pence for failing to overturn the election result. Finally, he was pressured into acting. “As the evidence demonstrates, the rioters at the Capitol had invaded the building and halted the electoral count. They did not begin to relent until President Trump finally issued a video statement instructing his supporters to leave the Capitol at 4:17 p.m., which had an immediate and helpful effect: rioters began to disperse,” the report said. The self-coup had failed. Biden’s election win would be certified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/21/california-storms-atmospheric-rivers-spring","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-22T01:39:50Z","webTitle":"One person killed and another injured in ‘remarkable’ California storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/21/california-storms-atmospheric-rivers-spring","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/21/california-storms-atmospheric-rivers-spring","fields":{"bodyText":"The second day of spring brought more harsh wintry weather to storm-weary California on Tuesday with torrential rain and heavy winds that left thousands without power. At least one person was killed on Tuesday when a tree fell on a vehicle in San Mateo county in the San Francisco Bay area, the California highway patrol told media. In Santa Cruz county, one person was injured by a falling tree, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters warned the storm, the 12th atmospheric river on the US west coast since December, would hit southern and central California the hardest. A vast stretch of the region, including most of the greater Los Angeles area, was under flood watches due to the extreme weather, which was expected to spread across the south-west and into the central Great Basin and Rockies by late Tuesday. The National Weather Service warned conditions would lead to difficult driving conditions, power outages and downed trees. Flooding prompted officials in southern California to close portions of the Pacific Coast highway on Tuesday morning. The NWS issued an excessive-rainfall notice for much of the southern California coast while high-wind warnings and advisories were in effect from the Mexico border through Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay area. The high mountains, still blanketed in white from a storm heavy winter, could see as much as 5ft of snow. By midday Tuesday, Santa Cruz county was hit with wind gusts of nearly 90mph that knocked down trees and power lines. The National Weather Service had issued a thunderstorm warning in parts of the county, calling the situation “life threatening” and advising residents to seek shelter immediately. With downed trees and power lines closing roads across the region, officials warned residents to avoid travel if at all possible. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist, described the weather as a “sudden violent wind storm” that reportedly snapped trees in half. The storm, Swain said, is remarkable. “I’ve never seen anything quite like it,” he said, describing its activity on the radar. Nearly 240,000 customers of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, one of the nation’s largest utilities, were without power by early afternoon, mostly in the region south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.us. The latest storm comes as California continues to grapple with the effects of an extreme winter, including widespread flooding and mountain towns buried in snow. The atmospheric river storms that have hit the state in recent months have dumped 30tn gallons of water across California, forcing entire towns to evacuate and leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. In Tulare county, including the historic black town of Allensworth, thousands of people are still under evacuation orders due to flooding after a levee breach. The rainfall has been beneficial for some of California’s aquifers. In some parts of the state, farmlands have been used to capture water and replenish groundwater. The state’s governor recently signed an executive order waiving permit requirements for groundwater recharge in some areas. Tuesday’s storm was driven by a Pacific cyclone swirling around an intense low-pressure system, drawing up vast quantities of moisture and steering it at the coast, according to William Churchill, a meteorologist with the NWS Weather Prediction Center. Unlike many of the earlier atmospheric rivers, the latest storm has a cooler load of moisture, meaning more of it will fall as snow in the higher coastal mountains and Sierra Nevada range. The weather service warned that the additional snowfall would heighten avalanche hazards in those areas. The Sierra Nevada has already seen massive amounts of snow this season, which is the second snowiest in the 77 years of record-keeping at the Central Sierra Snow Lab with more than 56.4ft. The weather has made life in the region particularly challenging – schools have closed for days, roofs have collapsed under heavy snow and officials have closed a major highway in the region several times. In the eastern Sierra Nevada, the Mammoth Mountain resort announced that it would remain open for skiing and snowboarding at least through the end of July. The lodge has received 634in of snow this season, and was probably just one storm away from breaking the all-time record of 668in (16.9 meters), which was set in the 2010-2011 season. With the latest storm, forecasts called for howling winds across much of the state, and gusts expected to reach nearly 75mph in southern California’s mountains and deserts, and 55 miles per hour along coasts and through inland valleys. Sustained winds blowing at or near gale force were predicted throughout the storm zone, Churchill said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T06:15:21Z","webTitle":"SA premier says buying nuclear submarines directly from US would degrade Australian shipbuilding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","fields":{"bodyText":"The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has criticised a proposal for Australia to buy nuclear submarines directly from the US, saying it would “not be acceptable” for his state to miss out on promised submarine manufacturing jobs. A report in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday suggested the Biden administration was considering a plan with the UK and Australia to fast-track nuclear-powered submarines for Australia by the mid-2030s by producing the first few submarines in the US. However, given existing production constraints at US shipyards, the deal would depend on Australia making a financial commitment to expand the US’s submarine-production capacity to ensure it could also meet its domestic demands. Malinauskas told Guardian Australia that while he understood the geopolitical need for the Australian government to expedite the process, Australian workers needed to be involved in any arrangement that included the new subs being manufactured in the US. “Clearly a South Australian workforce needs to acquire the skills to be able to build nuclear submarines and it makes sense that those skills are acquired working with the overseas partner that is already doing so,” he said. “We accept that the commonwealth has a substantial challenge, and is responding to what is widely accepted as the most unstable geopolitical climate the nation has found itself in for some time. We accept that is a risk that’s worthy of being addressed, but a degradation of our sovereign shipbuilding capacity is inconsistent with addressing that risk.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked if it would be acceptable for the Australian government to purchase submarines from the US without training an Australian workforce as part of the deal, Malinuaskas was clear. “No, that would not be acceptable from the state government’s perspective, because that would represent a degradation of what has been promised, and that is that these subs are being built in Australia,” he said. “It all depends on the pathway, and that detail really matters here – not just for the economic interests of the state, but also from our sovereign submarine-building capacity, which is such a central tenet of de-risking Australia’s security position.” How Australia intends to fill the capability gap between its existing Collins Class fleet and the new fleet of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines is the subject of a federal government review that is due to report by March next year. On Sunday the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the review, being undertaken by former defence minister Stephen Smith and former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston, would consider how best to fill the capability gap that would otherwise see Australia wait until the mid-2040s for new submarines. “What we’ve sought from the process that’s under way with Aukus right now is not simply to answer the question as to what platform we run with – although that’s clearly critical – but how soon we can get it,” Marles told Sky News. “To the extent that there is any capability gap, if we can bring the start date forward, what is the solution to plugging that? We obviously need to have a sense of cost, and we need to make sure that what we are doing is completely compliant with our non-proliferation obligations. And we’re confident that the body of work that’s under way now will be able to answer all those questions in the first part of next year.” Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that he had little sympathy for the view of the South Australian government, and the pendulum was swinging away from the defence budget being used as “a job subsidy scheme”. “We need to have a very clear-eyed discussion about these issues and not simply say, ‘building, assembling them here is a fantastic thing, that will be wonderful’,” Hellyer said. “It will cost more, it will take longer, you probably won’t have the industrial benefits that people say, and it will potentially have huge opportunity cost in terms of the human resources that we could be applying to sustaining the submarines.” “We shouldn’t default to immediately building all boats here regardless of the cost and the schedule impacts of doing that.” In a joint statement released last week to mark one year of the Aukus pact, the leaders of Australia, the UK and the US said that the group had made significant progress towards Australia acquiring conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. “We are steadfast in our commitment to Australia acquiring this capability at the earliest possible date,” the statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","fields":{"bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest windfarms will double its capacity to 2,000 megawatts, providing enough power for 1.4m homes and accelerating Queensland’s exit from fossil fuel-sourced electricity. Spain-based Acciona Energia announced on Monday it would extend a windfarm already being built within the MacIntyre Precinct, a region about 200km south-west of Brisbane. That first stage involves just under $2bn in investment and the construction of 180 wind turbines, each standing about 230m high with 5.7MW of capacity. The MacIntyre region is being developed in partnership with CleanCo, the Queensland government’s renewable energy arm, and has an expected start date in 2024. “With this project we expect to dramatically accelerate the decarbonisation of Queensland’s electricity grid,” said Acciona’s managing director in Australia, Brett Wickham. “Workers can move from one large-scale project to the next whilst staying in the same area.” The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the expansion plan was “a strong endorsement that Queensland is a renewable energy superpower”. Two months ago, Queensland announced a $62bn plan to accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, including an end to coal-fired power stations by as early as 2035. Up until then, the state had been the national laggard in terms of the share of renewable energy in the grid. The announcement of another $2bn to be pumped into renewables comes days after the Clean Energy Council said new commitment for large wind and solar plants had hit the lowest level in at least five years in the September quarter. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Just one new project, at 400MW, reached financial close during the period, down almost two-thirds on a year earlier. The council blamed policy uncertainty in recent years – particularly at the federal level – for the investment slowdown. Known as the Herries Range project, Acciona’s extension would also host 180 wind turbines and support as many as 600 additional jobs during construction, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. The state’s energy and jobs plan boasts more than 50 large-scale renewable energy projects that are operational, under construction or have reached financial commitment from developers, the government said. Prior to Monday’s announcement, New South Wales had signed up the most new projects and capacity over the past year, with eight projects accounting for more than a third of new projects and 65% of new capacity nationally, according to the Clean Energy Council. Victoria had the next most with six new projects accounting for 19% of new capacity, while Queensland had six projects (at 6% of capacity) and WA with three projects (and 4% of capacity). Acciona’s focus on windfarms rather than solar may be a template for other big energy companies. AGL Energy, for instance, has plans to invest as much as $20bn over the next decade or so into renewables and storage as its coal-fired power plants close. Its focus is likely to be on wind rather than solar energy because of the need to complement rather than compete with the spread of solar panels on households across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/16/rees-mogg-accused-of-grabbing-absolute-power-over-uk-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T13:09:30Z","webTitle":"Rees-Mogg accused of grabbing absolute power over UK energy industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/16/rees-mogg-accused-of-grabbing-absolute-power-over-uk-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/16/rees-mogg-accused-of-grabbing-absolute-power-over-uk-energy-industry","fields":{"bodyText":"The business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has been accused of launching a “power grab” as new legislation proposes to hand sweeping control over the energy industry to the government. The government last week introduced the energy prices bill to parliament to formalise the energy price guarantee, Liz Truss’s flagship policy to reduce household bills by limiting the cost of electricity and gas for two years. However, the Guardian understands that energy suppliers have raised concerns with the business department that the legislation contains proposals for the government to be able to effectively overrule Ofgem, the sector’s independent regulator. The draft legislation proposes to hand “power of the secretary of state to modify energy licences” as well as the “power of the secretary of state to give directions”. Ofgem is responsible for overseeing every element of a supplier’s licence, from ensuring vulnerable customers are correctly handled to rules governing smart meters. If approved in its current form, the legislation could override the authority of Ofgem. The regulator has been bruised by the energy crisis after its efforts to increase competition were undermined as more than 30 suppliers went bust when gas prices rapidly escalated. The Lords are expected to discuss the main principles and purpose of the bill at a second reading of the legislation on Wednesday. Energy companies are also unhappy that they were given little time to examine the legislation. Dhara Vyas, the director of advocacy at Energy UK, said:“It’s astonishing that the government gave the energy industry just 24 hours to respond to a draft bill which unexpectedly proposes giving ministers broad and seemingly unlimited new powers over the regulation of the industry. “While we certainly need swift legislation to enable the support for households and businesses this winter, the decision to include longer term measures in the bill with very significant potential consequences for the industry – which must therefore be examined and debated closely – is inexplicable. We are urging the government to reconsider so that they do not risk the measures which this bill should be delivering.” A senior source at one large energy supplier accused Rees-Mogg of a power grab “worthy of Henry VIII”. He said: “It gives absolute power to the secretary of state over all rules governing all aspects of the UK’s energy industry, in perpetuity.” “That means bypassing Ofgem and the entire licensing and regulatory regime without any safeguards or time constraints and no consultation or appeal process for anyone – supplier, generator, networks – affected by any decision.” An executive at another large energy company said: “This power grab means that the government could control the network, governance, pricing, the ability to acquire assets and infrastructure. It’s nationalisation by stealth.” Ofgem declined to comment. Its website states that parliamentary statutes establish its “duties and gives us powers to achieve our objectives”. “The government is responsible for setting the policy for the energy sector and proposing any changes to this statutory framework. We have a clear role to play to support policy issues such as decarbonisation and we need to operate within this framework. We do not direct overall policy in the sector. However, where we think there are important policy gaps that affect consumers, we can call this out,” it said. The business department did not respond to requests for comment. The energy price guarantee and the energy bill relief scheme, designed to reduce bills for businesses, have effectively given policymakers significant influence over the business models of Britain’s suppliers. Rees-Mogg had already angered the energy industry by suddenly announcing a windfall tax on low-carbon electricity generators last week. Executives are concerned the scant details included in the proposals will further spook investors after six months in which the government has blown hot and cold on the idea. Analysts are keen to discover the level of the cap and for how long the levy will be in place. Oil and gas firms were shocked to discover a windfall tax on their profits could last up to three years when a levy was announced earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jan/01/is-modern-life-ruining-our-powers-of-concentration","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-01T11:00:45Z","webTitle":"Is modern life ruining our powers of concentration?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/01/is-modern-life-ruining-our-powers-of-concentration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jan/01/is-modern-life-ruining-our-powers-of-concentration","fields":{"bodyText":"How does it feel inside your head? Turn your attention inwards. Maybe you’re daydreaming, allowing your mind to wander. Or maybe it feels sharp and alert. Maybe your thoughts are forging freely ahead, a sign that you have achieved the fabled state of “flow”. More likely, however, your brain feels like a browser with too many tabs open. From the widespread reports of a post-pandemic “brain fog” and the books on “deep work” and “stolen focus” topping bestseller lists, to the soaring diagnoses of ADHD in adults and children, it seems we are increasingly concerned by our ability to pay attention. Early last year, the Centre for Attention Studies at King’s College London found that 49% of 2,000 adults surveyed felt their attention span was shorter than it used to be. Almost as many (47%) agreed that “‘deep thinking’ has become a thing of the past”. These are generalisations and impossible to quantify – we have no consistent measure of attention or deep thinking, let alone of contrasting those through history with today’s. But the response proves that we at least perceive there’s a problem. I have been feeling the same myself. Last year, writing – my job for more than a decade – started to feel more laborious. Unrelated to the complexity of the task, I found it hard to manage my time, or structure an argument, or see how one thought followed another. Directing my attention felt outside my grasp. I confessed to a friend that I had been Googling the symptoms of ADHD, increasingly convinced I would receive a diagnosis. Or maybe, he replied, kindly, my struggle had more to do with spending upwards of eight hours a day staring at screens, without real breaks, for weeks at a time. Maybe the mental strain I was feeling was not a sign of executive dysfunction, but an apt response. “I’ve studied hundreds of people over the decades, and many, many people report feeling distracted and having a loss of control,” says cognitive psychologist Gloria Mark over Zoom. “But not everybody,” she adds. A professor of informatics at the University of California, Mark has been researching human-computer interaction and technology’s effects on our day-to-day lives since the mid 1990s. Now, in her first book Attention Span: Finding Focus for a Fulfilling Life, Mark brings together her findings for a lay audience, and the results are startling. It’s not as simple as flow good, screens bad. Most strikingly, it is not even the case that we should necessarily be striving to focus at all. Broadly speaking, there are two schools of thought on attention. The first argues that we haven’t lost our ability to focus, it has been wrested, even “stolen”, from us by technology. In this view we’re little more than lab rats lured by notifications and algorithms, pings and dings in a large-scale social experiment. We may develop strategies for resisting those dopamine dispensers, such as blocking software or switching to a “brick phone”. But the game is rigged against us. Those in the second camp may scoff at this: they maintain that most of our struggles with focus are more to do with self-control. There is no notification that can distract us unless we are on some level willing to be distracted. Even the notion of a “shorter attention span” may provoke scepticism. Instead, could it be that you’re just not that motivated? Whichever worldview you subscribe to – that our attention has been hijacked by our devices, or by our lack of self-discipline – they share an element of fatalism: there is either little you can do, or you’re just not doing enough. Mark believes that neither of these views is quite right. In Attention Span she dismantles common misconceptions about our attention, among them that we should always be striving to focus when at work on our computers, and that the mindless scrolling we do on screens is counterproductive. The reality is more nuanced, says Mark – but our digital lives have evolved so fast, we have found ourselves struggling to keep up or safeguard ourselves. “That’s why I think we’ve got to this point, where we’re having such a hard time controlling our attention, because we haven’t figured out yet how we can integrate this technology in our lives, and use it wisely.” Mark has been studying distraction since 2004, when she carried out the first of her studies on “knowledge workers” (who work primarily with computers). Shadowing them with a stopwatch, she logged how long they spent on one activity (opening their email) before switching to another (making a call). It was painstaking work – “like watching paint dry”, one of her participants said self-effacingly, of their own routine – but effectively illustrated how our attention roamed about, often with no obvious prompt. The results showed that people shifted their attention, on average, every three minutes or so (including to interact with colleagues). When restricted to just computer activity, it was about 30 seconds quicker. At the time this seemed unfathomably fast, says Mark, but it was nothing compared to what was to come. With developments in tracking technology in the 2010s, Mark was able to repeat the study with greater precision, amassing thousands of hours of observation. In 2012, the average time spent on any screen before switching was down to 74 seconds. Since then it has declined even further. Research by Mark and others from 2016 to 2021 put it relatively consistently at just 47 seconds – “crazily short”, she says. The result holds true regardless of job or age (though Mark studied all adults; distraction in developing minds is even less known). “Simply put,” Mark concludes in her book, “our personal use of technologies affects our ability to pay attention.” Those in the first camp might feel validated by this. But, Mark cautions, it’s not a straightforward tradeoff. “There are so many things in our culture and society that collude to make us distracted – it’s more than just targeted algorithms.” In film and TV, for example, shot lengths have been getting pacier over decades, potentially influencing our own processing and behaviour in ways we may not be aware of. On social media, we consume and produce content in bite-size chunks, at a frenetic pace. “We are creating the culture,” says Mark. “Our attention spans have shaped the media, and the media in turn is shaping our attention.” Further complicating the issue is that, though the world at large might seek to distract us, we are not equally susceptible. “There’s aspects of our individual natures – it’s more than just a lack of willpower,” she says. Personality plays a part in how we use the internet, and what for. Some people find it easier than others to recover from interruptions, making them more effective multitaskers. Others are innately predisposed towards self-regulation. “If they go to social media, they are pretty good at getting themselves back on track,” says Mark. For some, individual traits coalesce with context to create a perfect storm of distraction. Mark’s research found the higher a person scores in neuroticism and urgency tests, the shorter their attention span. “It doesn’t mean you can’t change – but you’ll have a harder time than others.” Mark’s own doctor confessed to an extreme strategy for writing a grant application: to book a round-trip plane journey from California to Washington DC, and write on the plane, literally rising above earthly distractions. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. “He said he has to change his environment. He has to put himself in a place where he can’t get access to the internet – and apparently he’s got the money to do it.” The very design of the internet mirrors how we think, explaining how we can lose hours down a rabbit hole on YouTube or Wikipedia. “In terms of a semantic network, we think naturally in terms of associations, and the internet just aligns with that so well,” says Mark. Stress and exhaustion further exacerbate the problem, diminishing our ability to resist temptation. It means the line between free will and conditioning has blurred: we might genuinely want to learn more, or we might be impulsively clicking on links. Either way, our curiosity is aroused and – with the next video or webpage – rewarded, perpetuating the cycle. The many influences Mark identifies on our attention – individual, social, environmental, technological – emphasises not only the scale of the challenge, but the limits of zeroing in on any one of them for a potential solution. Distraction isn’t a tech problem, or a people problem – it’s both, inextricably intertwined. Indeed, one of Mark’s most disquieting findings is that we have become so accustomed to being interrupted, we do it to ourselves. Mark found that email trumped social media as a source of interruptions, with study participants checking their inboxes an average of 77 times daily (one checked 374 times). But most concerning was that 41% were doing so of their own accord, without external triggers. It’s proof that even if we turn off notifications, we can’t escape those internal triggers. “We have these 47-second attention spans, and we maintain them by interrupting ourselves,” Mark says. “I feel it myself, this tension that builds up so that I have to change my screen – go to a new site, or social media, or whatever.” Accordingly, the salve often proposed for fragmented focus is flow, the psychological state of being so engrossed in your work that you lose track of time, and even the outside world. Mark has extensive experience of flow, though not in her scientific career. Before she did a master’s degree in statistics, paving the way for her to pursue psychology and computer usage, Mark studied fine art, specialising in abstract expressionism. She abandoned her dreams of being an artist in the face of the economic reality – but years later, those hours spent in flow, painting and drawing, and thinking laterally proved valuable in her scientific research. What she discovered is that most knowledge work requires analytical thinking that precludes us from getting swept away. “You see a lot of people claim that when you’re working on your computers and in your everyday life, you can get into flow, but it’s very much about the nature of the work. Working on a spreadsheet or writing a report – it’s not conducive.” In fact, flow depends on a certain level of challenge, whereby we feel pleasurably engaged and extended, making us happy, but also causing low-level stress. “It’s a myth that we should be continually focused – it’s too stressful,” says Mark. Equally, though mindless digital diversions like playing Candy Crush or even scrolling social media might seem like exactly the kind of time-wasting that we should be striving to avoid, it actually serves a valuable function, says Mark. That kind of easy, rote activity is not only enjoyable, it replenishes our cognitive resources, necessary for us to be productive later on. The fact that flow is not only rare, but draining; and that taking a break to scroll a different screen or play a game on your phone can be restorative, is proof of the need for nuance. The moralising over productivity and screentime is unhelpful when it comes to finding solutions – but highly profitable as the boom in (useless) blue-light glasses and “distraction-free” tech goes to show. Last year, writer Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus, decrying the “huge invasive forces” corroding our concentration and championing flow as a solution, was a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic. Stolen Focus concludes by calling for an urgent societal “movement to reclaim our minds” – and, in the meantime chase that flow state. (Hari himself took a months-long “digital detox” on Cape Cod.) Like others, Mark has “concerns” about Hari’s “one-sided” argument and research. It is no more possible for us to sustain focus all day than it is for us to lift weights nonstop, she says – yet that is exactly what many of us expect of ourselves, at the expense of our own wellbeing. The problem is felt well beyond the small segment of the population with ADHD, says Mark. “People are saying we have this ‘epidemic of ADHD’, but we should hold back on making that claim.” More research is needed into any relation between ADHD and use of personal devices – but it may be that people are simply exhausted and trying, and failing to focus. Much advice sidesteps this self-assessment through the use of productivity software that restricts access to social media. But this, says Mark, undermines our autonomy. “Especially the cold-turkey approach, it takes agency away from people – like having training wheels on your bike, and you never learn to ride the bike.” In Attention Span, Mark makes the case for a new, evidence-based approach to attention, one that works with our tech-riddled modern world and tendencies towards distraction, instead of trying to squeeze the genie back in the bottle. “We are stuck with technology, we can’t give it up, so let’s not even talk about that – but we can use it in an intelligent way, to find the benefits.” Rather than aspiring towards flow, or always being focused, Mark suggests we should aim for a “balance of attentional states” that reflects our natural circadian rhythms. Identifying your individual chronotype – whether you work better early, late or are a moderate type; sometimes split into lions, bears, dolphins and wolves – can help you to structure your day for ease, Mark says. “It’s a matter of understanding when you’re at your peak, when you’ve got the capacity to do hard work, to be creative – and to understand when you don’t.” She and I are both “bears”, so are most productive in daylight, between 10am and 2pm – when lions are winding down, and dolphins and wolves are getting started. By becoming aware of those precious peaks, Mark says, we can protect that window for work requiring creativity or concentration – not “wasting” them on email. She has learned to do it herself. “I used to get totally exhausted. At the end of the day, my brain was just fried… I learned to pull back and take a break.” Now, for her downtime, Mark will schedule undemanding admin – or revive with a walk around the block, or by playing an online word game. “I realised that I had been under so much stress for a very long time,” she says. At the societal level, Mark supports “right to disconnect” laws to combat email overload, but says the cultural shift may have to come first. She suggests cultivating “meta-awareness” of our own attention – whether we have resources to burn, or need to refuel – and engagement with tech. “If you end up going to social media, keep yourself in the present by asking: ‘Am I still getting value out of being here?’” If not, and you’re feeling increasingly drained or, conversely, refreshed, “then leave,” Mark says. It is a more pragmatic – and even, dare I say, empowering – outlook on our technological future than many. “I am very optimistic that we can take control, and change the way things are,” agrees Mark. But the first step is accepting that our attention, like our time, is finite – and that we can choose how we spend it.

Washington’s rapid reaction to the Iranian text, which had been delivered shortly before 3am on Friday Tehran time, directly contradicted Tehran’s claims that its proposals presented “a constructive approach” aimed at “finalising the negotiations”. Only minutes after the Iran proposals were received by the EU and passed on to Washington, the Biden administration gave it a provisional, but abrupt, thumbs down. “We can confirm that we have received Iran’s response through the EU,” a state department spokesman said. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive.” An unnamed US official was quoted in Politico as saying: “Based on their answer we appear to be moving backwards.” It is not clear what was in the Iranian text that was the latest round in a to-and-fro exchange with Washington aimed at tweaking a draft agreement presented by the EU on 8 August. Iran gave its first response to the draft on 15 August, which was followed by a response from the US. The latest Iranian document was, in turn, a reply to the US text. Officials on both sides had been cautiously optimistic about the possibility of converge on a final agreement that will revive a 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. That agreement has been severely eroded since Donald Trump withdrew US participation in 2018 and reintroduced sanctions. Last week, John Kirby, the US national security spokesman, had hailed what he called Iranian concessions and on Wednesday this week said the White House remained “hopeful” there would be a deal. Early on Friday in Tehran, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, had said Iran’s latest text presented “a constructive approach with the aim of finalising the negotiations”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had also struck an optimistic note on Wednesday in an address to French diplomats in Paris, saying he hoped a new deal could be agreed on “in the next few days”. But Ali Alizadeh, a member of the Iranian parliament security commission had dampened that optimism, by warning that the US position was not aligned with the EU draft text, saying it had dashed his earlier hopes that agreement was days away. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said Iran still needed stronger guarantees that the lifting of US sanctions would have a practical impact, and could not readily be reimposed by future US administrations. “On guarantees, we need a stronger text,” the minister said in Moscow at a press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Joe Biden has said he can guarantee US compliance with the agreement under his presidency but not by future administrations – in effect giving Iran only a two-year guarantee of sanctions relief. The US has tried to give Tehran comfort by vowing that any trade or investment deals signed before a future US administration left the agreement would be legally immune from US sanctions for as long as five years. Iran is also seeking guarantees that by the time the agreement comes fully into force, the west will entirely drop its three-year inquiry into unexplained nuclear particles found at nuclear sites before 2003. The EU has suggested the inquiry might be dropped so long as credible explanations are provided. Iran fears the probe’s continued existence might be used as a pretext to maintain or reimpose sanctions. The Russian envoy to the nuclear talks in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, urged the west to relent saying: “No current illegal activities are taking place there.” One of the most difficult issues has been how to handle Iran’s advanced centrifuges and surplus stock of uranium enriched by the Iranians in breach of the original agreement. The west wanted the destruction of these centrifuges or their removal from Iran, but Iran only wants to dismantle and store these devices within Iran. Iran argues that the warehousing of the centrifuges in an IAEA supervised building will act as a sword of Damocles, and serve as a guarantee that the US will abide by the agreement. US Republicans also want guarantees that enriched surplus uranium will not be sent to Russia, without UN oversight. Israeli officials say the deal opens a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon since it will be allowed to begin operating advanced centrifuges by 2026 and then enrich more uranium at higher levels by 2031. But advocates of the deal say the alternative, no deal at all – is worse, and these expiry dates can be extended in negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T16:45:47Z","webTitle":"Solar power payback takes much longer than you think | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","fields":{"bodyText":"Your article suggests that a 4 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system can save its owners £980 a year at 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) and £1,575 at the 45p per kWh that is coming soon (Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines, 20 August). This estimate overlooks the important fact that most electricity is produced in summer, and all of it in daylight, while most consumption is in winter and at night. Our 4kW system has produced about 4,000kWh a year for the last 10 years. Although that is equivalent to our annual consumption we only consume about 30% of what we produce, despite having a household of three stay-at-home pensioners and electric cooking and water heating. An average day in summer produces 15-20kWh. In winter it is a fraction of that: the total for the whole of January is about 100kWh. This means that interseasonal storage or huge overcapacity would be required to go off grid; batteries at this scale will not be either environmentally or economically appropriate to achieving self-sufficiency. I have a log of production and consumption in five-minute intervals for one year, and using that data I calculate that with a battery system I could consume an additional 30% of our production. A larger system (8kWh storage) would not save proportionately more than a smaller (3kWh) system, because a large battery will not be fully charged on most days in the winter. At foreseeable electricity prices a 4kW system with or without a small battery may pay for itself within its lifetime, but not within the five to seven years suggested – although higher feed-in tariffs that reflect the value of the electricity exported would substantially reduce payback times.

Compared with his opening speech some four weeks previously, a wild-eyed address that went viral in a manner unusual for sports administrators, it appears harmless enough. But the more you stare at the words, the more revealing the sentence becomes. The power of football has been a matter of contention for the duration of Qatar 2022. What the world’s most popular spectator sport symbolises, what it can achieve, and what it can cover up have been the subject of intense debate. Tomorrow the tournament reaches its climax with a blue-chip final between France and Argentina. As the world tunes in, perhaps now is the time to draw conclusions as to the effect of such power. The first conclusion is that football had enough to persuade a tiny, inordinately wealthy Gulf state to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars. The estimated cost to Qatar of staging the World Cup is $220bn, a price that has transformed the country. It has built seven stadiums, a metro network, even a new city in the eerie, ersatz shape of Lusail, the location for the final. Everything that Qatar wanted to show to the world, either to those who visited for the tournament or – more importantly – the billions watching on television, has been brand new. The cost of building this new Qatar cannot be quantified purely by money. In the years, months, weeks and days leading up to the World Cup, consistent attention was drawn to a hidden price: the death, injury and exploitation of thousands of migrant workers lured to the Gulf. Awareness was also raised as to the absence of rights afforded LGBTQ+ people in the country, although less attention was paid to its oppressive laws on women. A second conclusion about the power of football would be that it created the space for journalists and NGOs to highlight issues that might otherwise have remained out of sight. Ultimately, any such focus began to dissipate when the World Cup finally started. For Fifa, it was about time. Before the tournament Infantino told countries looking for guarantees on a human rights legacy to “let football take the stage”. On the eve of the opening match, and after declaring he felt Qatari, gay and a migrant worker in the same breath, he booted the question of football’s responsibility for suffering caused by the World Cup into the indeterminate future. There would, Infantino said, be a “labour excellence hub” established in Doha at some point. But there would be no centre for migrant workers looking to protect their rights and no financial remedy for those who had experienced loss. Instead a legacy fund would be directed at educating children across the world. Meanwhile, and never publicly, a number of European sides were told to stop wearing armbands that showed solidarity with LGBTQ+ people in the region. Never mind the human rights, here came the football, and it arrived in unprecedented form. Never before had a World Cup been played in such a compressed geographical area; the distance between the northernmost stadium at Al Bayt and the southernmost, Al Janoub, was some 40 miles. Never before had four games been played in a single day of a World Cup, as they were through the group stage. For those in Qatar, as well as those viewing at home, it was possible to gorge on football – especially when most fixtures were far from sold out. After a typically limp performance from the hosts on opening night, Qatar losing 2-0 to Ecuador in front of an ambivalent crowd at Al Bayt, the tournament caught fire in quick order. On day two, England scored six against Iran, putting a smile back on the face of players – especially Bukayo Saka – last seen broken after the final of last year’s European Championship. Day three brought the first shock – Saudi Arabia coming from a goal behind to beat Lionel Messi’s Argentina. An epochal moment for football in the Gulf, it was marked by bizarre symbols: the emir of Qatar draping the flag of his country’s fierce rival around his shoulders; Saudi fans marching through the streets of Doha like European ultras; Messi’s face in every Qatari ad break boosting Saudi as a tourist destination. More weirdness and many more upsets were to follow. Japan beat first Germany then Spain by summoning brief, irresistible bursts of frenzied play which overran their opponents. Brazil’s Richarlison scored a scissor kick against Serbia that signalled to the world jogo bonito was back, while Kylian Mbappé of France laid claim to the title of “best player in the world” with a streak of devastating finishing. Australia knocked out Denmark with canny counterattacking, South Korea did the same to Uruguay with a perfect late breakaway against Portugal, and suddenly, for the first time, a representative of every continent had reached the knockout stages. Joining the usual phalanx of European and South American teams were the US, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Senegal and Morocco. As the knockout stages began, something like regular service was resumed. Many of the upstarts were taken care of and some in dramatic fashion, including Korea’s 4-1 humbling by Brazil and Senegal’s comprehensive 3-0 defeat by England. But Morocco stayed in, edging past Spain on penalties in the last 16, then beating Portugal to become the first African side to reach a semi-final – an achievement that tilted the world of football very slightly on its axis. Relatively few fans travelled to this World Cup and official crowd statistics felt inflated or unreliable, itself a common sensation. But it was inarguable that Morocco, alongside Argentina and Saudi Arabia, were among the countries who had travelled in decent numbers. The presence of armies of supporters in red and green and lion outfits illuminated Doha and helped to give the World Cup a distinct character that all the branding, light shows and hype men of Qatar couldn’t muster. On the pitch, Morocco were rigorous, unrelenting and lifted by moments of magic from Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi and the goalkeeper Yassine “Bono” Bounou. Off the pitch they were humble and determined, respectful to opponents but not afraid to embrace the joy of their success or, in the case of the forward Sofiane Boufal, dance with their mother on the touchline. Whether they represented Africa, the Arab world or the power of diaspora, the Atlas Lions and their fans told a story that was relatable the entire world over. Ultimately, Morocco were done for by France, who, even in taking out an impressive England in the quarter-finals, seemed to play only when they had to (but knew precisely when that ought to be). On the other side of the draw, Argentina had recovered from their opening setback to grow stronger throughout, with Messi rolling back the years as they did so. His dominant performance in the semi-final against Croatia, and especially his tormenting of the star defender Joško Gvardiol, made comparisons to the national icon Diego Maradona no longer feel inappropriate. At last, the star of an individualistic age looked set to deliver for his country, only for the final obstacle to be Mbappé, another superstar whose reputation has been built on bursts of solo brilliance. The final should be a fitting end to a tournament that has displayed international football at its best. Just by reeling through the highlights, the problems of this World Cup – and there were more, from actions taken against protesting Iranian fans to an effective ban on the rainbow flag – fade into the background. It is this power which Infantino says he is “convinced” of. The joy of the game, he argues, is a panacea for the ills that afflict society or, at least, a screen to block them out. “I believe those fans who come to the stadium and the billions of fans watching on TV … they want to spend 90 minutes without having to think about anything else, forget their problems and enjoy football,” he said on Friday. Infantino has tested the effectiveness of this power in Qatar and plans to use it to extend the influence of Fifa. The men’s World Cup is to expand to 48 nations in four years’ time, and Fifa has plans for a 32-team men’s Club World Cup from 2025. All this expansion must be enabled by money, and bringing the World Cup to the Gulf has generated $7.5bn of it. Infantino can get more from the Saudis, who want to host the tournament in 2030, or perhaps return to previous plans to welcome China into the bosom of the football family. Despite his conviction, however, perhaps Infantino is wrong. Maybe the power of football is not as the opium of the masses, but as something that glimmers beyond the machinations of power. Maybe this past month has reminded us once more that what matters about the beautiful game, what draws so many towards it, is the joy that comes from play and collective endeavour. Something which, still, remains accessible to all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/11/donald-trump-liable-e-jean-carroll-sexual-abuse-accountability","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"Trump symbolized powerful men’s impunity for sexual abuse – until now | Moira Donegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/donald-trump-liable-e-jean-carroll-sexual-abuse-accountability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/donald-trump-liable-e-jean-carroll-sexual-abuse-accountability","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s been nearly seven years since the nation heard Donald Trump bragging on tape to Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush about his habit for sexually assaulting women. It’s been seven years since the Republican presidential candidate shrugged off the remark as “locker room talk” – classifying sexual abuse as private, unserious, a prerogative of what he still claimed, then at 70 years old, was his boyish playfulness. It’s been seven years since he won the presidency anyway – a historic humiliation of women that affirmed powerful men’s impunity for sexual abuse, and portrayed Trump’s boorish hostility to women’s dignity as compatible with the solemnity of presidential power. It’s been just over six years since those women poured into the streets in defiant declaration of their own citizenship at the Women’s March, and six years since a wave of anger at the rampant and habitual sexual abuse of women by men exploded into the #MeToo movement. But it took a New York jury less than three hours to unanimously agree that Donald Trump sexually abused the writer E Jean Carroll in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-90s, and then defamed her when he said she was lying about it. When the verdict came down, it felt like letting out a breath you didn’t know you were holding. Donald Trump is, we can now say, legally affirmed as a sexual abuser. A total of 26 women have publicly accused him of misconduct. Two of those other accusers testified at the Carroll trial, describing how Trump allegedly cornered them, like he did Carroll, in tight, semi-public places, after brief conversations, and besieged them by kissing, groping, and yes, grabbing their genitals. These women matter in their particularity – their humiliation and anger at what he did to them, their certainty, often carried for years, that there was nothing they could do about it. But Donald Trump has also long served, in the imagination of American women, as a symbol. He’s the embodiment of male privilege; things are made unreasonably easy for him that for women are made unjustly hard. Trump is a man who enjoys being treated as smart even when he is ignorant, who is trusted by many even when he’s outright lying, whose inflated opinion of himself is rewarded with jobs he isn’t qualified for and power he cannot be trusted with. He is also a symbol of casual misogyny, of droning and repetitive male sexual entitlement, and of the dismissiveness – ranging from vulgar indifference to seething contempt – that many men feel for the proposition that they should treat women as their equals. This much has been apparent for as long as Trump has monopolized national attention, and it was made vividly clear over the course of the trial by Carroll’s legal team, whose thoroughgoing account of a series of allegations against Trump by multiple women illustrated the former president’s modus operandi for sexual assault – a grim routine he seems to have repeated over and over again, against any number of women, for decades. Part of what has been so provoking for feminists about Donald Trump is not that he is so unique in his habit of sexual predation, but that he is so typical. Women like Carroll, along with the two other accusers who testified in support of her claim, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, describe eerily familiar encounters with the former president, each marked by Trump’s signature combination of ostentatious wealth and singular bad taste. Leeds, a woman roughly Carroll’s age, describes being seated next to Trump on an airplane in the 1970s after she was upgraded to first class; after chit-chatting, he lunged at her, assaulting her as other passengers and crew looked on. They did not help; she had to extricate herself. Stoynoff, a former writer for People, recalled Trump cornering her in a room at Mar-a-Lago in the aughts, while she was there to write a profile of him and Melania. “We’re going to go to Peter Luger’s, we’re going to have an affair,” she recalled Trump telling her, referring to the famous New York City steak restaurant. These stories, and those of other women, show that Trump considered sexual access to women a prerogative of his maleness and his money, something that he was entitled to regardless of their own opinions on the matter, and something for which he would never be held accountable. What was enraging is not just that he believed this. It is that for a very long time, he was right. But if Trump is a typical abuser, E Jean Carroll’s case is deeply atypical. For one thing, few people would have the grace and stamina that Carroll showed on the stand, particularly under the pressure of a grueling cross-examination which the 79-year-old Carroll handled with lucidity, calm and occasionally righteous pointedness. Once, in response to a line of questioning conducted in sexist bad faith by Trump’s lawyer Joe Tacopina, Carroll bluntly declared: “He raped me whether I screamed or not.” The line seemed destined to instantly enter the historical lexicon for its clear-sighted defiance. And it’s true, too, that few survivors would ever have had the support or resources to pursue a civil claim against their attacker that Carroll has had. Carroll was aided by the passage of the Adult Survivors Act, a one-time extension of the statute of limitations for sexual violence civil cases in New York, a bill that was pushed by the New York State Democratic party in no small part with an eye toward allowing Carroll to sue Trump. She was aided, too, by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn and a major Democratic donor, who is funding Carroll’s litigation. In short, there was an impressive, monied and not wholly benevolent machine behind Carroll’s lawsuit, one that was interested in the outcome of her claim more because of who her attacker is than because of any principled opposition to sexual violence. It would be reductive, and false, to paint Carroll as a mere pawn of this machine; she has proved herself to be much more formidable. But it is unfortunate that so few women receive such support. It’s often said that justice for sexual assault accusers is a matter of believing women. But what seemed most at stake in E Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against Trump was not whether she would be believed, but whether it would matter. Trump’s own statements about his conduct toward women, the accounts of more than two dozen women about how he treated them, and everything suggested by all his actions, attitude and character all indicate that Carroll is telling the truth; that much seemed obvious long before the trial started. What was of greater significance was whether the court – one of those recalcitrant and frequently reactionary bodies that are entrusted with making official designations of right and wrong, acceptable and unacceptable – would agree with her claim that it mattered, that he didn’t get to act that way, that she deserved better. It is enormously significant, not just for E Jean Carroll but for all the women who were subjected to living under the indignity of a Trump presidency, that it did.

Wildlife experts have said it is “outrageous” that sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), which are some of the most important areas for nature in the country, could be “determined by politics rather than science”. Devon Tory MPs and farmers on Dartmoor have been embroiled in a row with Natural England over its management of the SSSIs on the moor. The watchdog has said taxpayer-funded nature-friendly farming payments could be stripped from farmers who are causing SSSIs to be damaged by overgrazing. It has recommended farmers reduce their sheep stocks. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents rural landowners, told the government it was “losing confidence” in Natural England after it threatened to take away the payments from landowners in charge of failing SSSIs. The Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Cox has called for an inquiry, saying “we need to look again at the arm’s length agencies”. The farming minister Mark Spencer has agreed to hold an inquiry into how Natural England is managing SSSIs on Dartmoor. During a debate in parliament last week, he said: “I pay tribute to [Cox] for the work that he has done on his plan for us to undertake, as soon as possible, an independent evidence review covering the ecological condition of designated sites on Dartmoor. I subscribe to his view. The plan is worthy of support, and I, alongside the department, will work with him, Natural England and those representatives to undertake that independent review.” The former environment secretary George Eustice suggested Natural England’s powers could be weakened now the UK had left the EU. “I looked at arm’s length body reform during my tenure at Defra, and the truth is that the structure we have was designed for an EU era,” he said. “Many of these agencies were given powers to, effectively, implement EU law directly, and they were specifically designed to bypass democratic structures. “It is not sensible for Natural England to have to make the decisions on SSSIs. Instead, ministers should take such decisions, having taken advice from Natural England and others, which would restore accountability.” There are fears that this could have wider implications in cases where the financial interests of landowners may clash with Natural England’s advice for good management of SSSIs. Some fear that if ministers are in control of management they could make politically expedient decisions rather than the right choices for nature. Nature organisations said they had feared for some time that the Conservatives had an agenda to undermine environmental institutions in favour of landowning interests. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “It’s outrageous the government is even thinking right now of weakening or dismantling the very institutional infrastructure that is needed to protect and restore nature in this country. “We have a proud tradition in Britain of trying to follow the science when trying to make policy when it comes to conservation. But we know we have some in government who would rather move to having ‘sites of political convenience’. “This is not the time to be undermining our institutions. There have been certain sections of the Conservative party who have been thinking this for many years. It is no surprise they are willing to exploit a slight controversy happening on Dartmoor for their own political ends.” The RSPB has branded Spencer’s decision a “dangerous and slippery slope”. Its site policy officer, Blanaid Denman, said: “As the legal regulator, Natural England must be allowed to do its job without political interference. “The outrageous implication that favourable conservation status or appropriate management should be determined by politics, rather than science, is a dangerous and slippery slope, which would not only undermine our ability to meet domestic and international targets but leave nature the poorer.” Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “To meet its 2030 nature targets, the government should increase the funding available for good management of SSSIs. Land managers should be paid much better than they are now to ensure these vital places for nature are quickly restored. But it’s absolutely right that scientific experts should set the terms of those agreements for public payments, not ministers.” Caroline Cotterell, director of resilient landscapes and seas at Natural England said: “Natural England has a crucial role to play in delivering the government’s environmental improvement plan across England. There are no planned changes to our role, powers or resources. “As the statutory advisor and regulator of SSSIs we are working with partners towards the target of bringing 75% of protected sites into favourable condition, and use our scientific expertise when determining where new protected sites are needed. Thriving nature and sustainable farming are inextricably interlinked and we are working with farmers across the country to find solutions that work for both. “We are working hard with farmers in Dartmoor National Park, alongside Defra and local representatives to improve the damaged SSSIs in the national park. We welcome the independent review into how, together, we can best achieve sustainable farming on Dartmoor” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/08/radiation-hotspots-legacy-of-british-nuclear-tests-lingers-on-idyllic-islands-in-western-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-08T00:00:13Z","webTitle":"Radiation ‘hotspots’: legacy of British nuclear tests lingers on idyllic islands in Western Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/08/radiation-hotspots-legacy-of-british-nuclear-tests-lingers-on-idyllic-islands-in-western-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/08/radiation-hotspots-legacy-of-british-nuclear-tests-lingers-on-idyllic-islands-in-western-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"The white ocean sands of Western Australia’s Montebello Islands may appear inviting, but 70 years ago they were the site of Britain’s first nuclear tests. Now researchers are working to uncover how much and what type of radioactive material persists in sediment on the ocean floor of the archipelago, made up of 265 low-lying islands and islets, 1,200km north of Perth. They hope to get a clearer idea of its effects on the area’s abundant marine life and any lingering dangers to people who visit the islands for tourism or fishing. The nuclear fallout from atomic blasts in the 1950s have been well studied on land, but little is known about how radioactive sands affect the 60,000-hectare marine park’s ecosystem. In June 2020 a team led by Madison Hoffman, an environmental radioecologist at Edith Cowan University, collected hundreds of kilograms of sediment from an area near the blast sites, 120km west of Dampier, for analysis. Hoffman says they detected levels of radioactivity higher than background levels, as expected. “Those levels are highest in areas around where those three detonations took place, but we also have some areas which have come up with levels a little higher than we expected for where we found them.” The 12 nuclear tests carried out between 1952 and 1957 – including three in the Montebellos – were part of a secretive deal between Britain and Australia that was championed by the then prime minister, Robert Menzies. Further “minor trials” were carried out in South Australia until 1963. The first test, codenamed Operation Hurricane, took place on 4 October 1952 at a lagoon off Trimouille Island in the Montebellos. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A decommissioned warship, HMS Plym, was rigged up with a 7kg plutonium device, sending tonnes of seawater and mud 3,000 metres into the air and impregnating the ocean sand with radioactive isotopes. On 16 May and 19 June 1956 two more bombs were set off from towers at Trimouille and Alpha islands as part of Operation Mosaic. The bombs were boosted with hydrogen and lithium and were the biggest ever detonated in Australia. Hoffman says while some radionuclides, or radioactive atoms, are blasted inside sand grains, others attach to the surface of sediment and shift in rough weather, such as during cyclonic activity. “When we know what radionuclides there are and what ratios they are in, they can act like a fingerprint, kind of like a forensics tool that is distinct to the Montebellos,” Hoffman says. “When sediment rock gets moved from point A to point B, it is taking those radionuclides with it and potentially moving those hotspots and migrating them around.” Hoffman wants to know where these hotspots are so she can study how the radiation exposure affects sediment-dwelling marine life. The area is home to a rich variety of marine species including dugongs, turtles, whales, hundreds of fish species and mangroves. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency has classified the area as an “existing exposure situation” with radiation levels “not considered to be excessively dangerous”. It says environmental assessments show “no significant risk to the local marine ecosystem and that remediation attempts are not justified and could devastate local ecosystems”. “There are no changes to existing arrangements for tourists.” But Darren Koppel, a marine contaminant expert with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says low levels of radiation over long periods can cause chronic toxicity to plants and other organisms. “We do not have much data on the chronic effects of radiation to marine organisms, so this type of research is critical to fill those data gaps,” Koppel says. “The most likely effect is that sensitive organisms and plants will have stopped living or growing in the areas with higher radioactivity, leaving only the more tolerant species.” The Montebello Islands are managed by the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. It says there are still “slightly elevated radiation levels” at Trimouille and Alpha islands and warns tourists not to camp or spend longer than one hour at those sites. Tourists travel from the nearby towns of Karratha, Port Hedland, Onslow and Dampier on fishing trips. Despite warning signs , the department has found evidence of campers on the islands in recent years. In the Great Victoria Desert, in outback South Australia, authorities spent millions trying to clean up radioactive fallout from nuclear testing at Maralinga, where the British detonated seven atomic bombs. According to researchers at Monash University, residual plutonium and uranium still contaminate the land at Maralinga as tiny radioactive grains in the soil. Little heed was given to the Anangu Pitjantjatjara people who lived on the land, who lived with the legacy of the explosions for decades afterwards. It wasn’t until 1994 that the Australian government paid $13.5m in compensation for what had been done to the land. British and Australian servicemen exposed to radiation by the blasts have also fought long campaigns for the effects on their health to be recognised and adequately compensated. Last month, the outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced that £500,000 ($870,000) would be spent to commemorate the servicemen who worked for Britain’s nuclear testing program. On 5 September he said in a letter to veterans of the nuclear tests they deserved medals for “having forged and protected our country’s protective shield”. Hoffman says that key technical documents about the nuclear testing, which could help with her research, were reclassified by the UK in 2018. “We have so little documentation or information about what really happened,” Hoffman said. “Without that information and all the really crucial statistics [about the blasts] it is really difficult to make sense of the answers we have now in relation to what originally happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/24/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-defence-strategic-review-changes-australias-military-priorities","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T02:14:31Z","webTitle":"Five things you need to know about how the defence strategic review changes Australia’s military priorities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-defence-strategic-review-changes-australias-military-priorities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-defence-strategic-review-changes-australias-military-priorities","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government released the defence strategic review on Monday, promising $19bn of spending to help improve the range and force projection of the Australian defence force to Australia’s north in response to greater major power competition. 1. The world has changed The review found, and the government agreed, that the ADF is “not fully fit for purpose”. The review said the ADF is aimed to address “radically different” strategic circumstances, particularly that “our alliance partner, the US “is no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific”, an obvious reference to the rise of China. “The region has seen the return of major power strategic competition and the intensity of which should be seen as the defining feature of our region and time,” it said, warning that Australia must manage and seek to avoid “the prospect of major conflict in the region that directly threatens our national interest”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The review said there is only a “remote possibility of any power contemplating an invasion of our continent” but that “the threat of military force or coercion against Australia does not require invasion.” It cited threats to trade routes, cyberwarfare, and long range missile strikes as developments that have “radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits” of the “comfort of distance”. 2. National defence v defence of Australia In the postwar period the priority has been the defence of Australia doctrine, focused on low-level conflict from small to middle regional powers, which the review said is “no longer suitable”. Instead, the new approach is national defence, which includes preparing for “potential threats rising from major power competition, including the prospect of conflict”. Australia’s defence force will now have five jobs: defending the nation; deterring adversaries through denial, particularly from projecting force against Australia from its northern approaches; protecting our economic connection with the region and the world; collective security of the Indo-Pacific; and maintenance of the international rules based order. 3. More force projection The review found that the navy needs “enhanced lethality” – hence the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine acquisition, and a recommendation for a continuous naval shipbuilding program. According to the national defence statement accompanying the review, the army must be “optimised for littoral operations in our northern land and maritime spaces and provide a long-range strike capability”. This includes more long-range firing weapons (Himars) and land-based maritime strike capabilities. The army’s range for firing projectile munitions will increase from 40km to initially a range of 300km, and with the acquisition of the precision strike missile, ranges in excess of 500km. The review also called for the “rapid establishment of domestic manufacturing” of guided weapons, with options to develop a domestic missile industry to be provided by the second quarter of 2024. The government agreed this is a priority. 4. Cuts to army to help pay for $19bn of spending The review recommended that “defence funding should be increased to meet our strategic circumstances.” The total to be spent on implementing the review is $19bn over four years, including the $9bn spent on Aukus submarines. There will need to be “difficult decisions and tradeoffs to manage the defence budget over the immediate period”, it said. There are $7.8bn of cuts achieved through “reprioritisation of the integrated investment program”. Guardian Australia understands six defence projects have been cancelled; six delayed; and 21 “rescoped”, including a reduction in land combat vehicles from 450 to 129. The second regiment of army self-propelled howitzers will be cancelled immediately. There’s also a short and sharp review of the navy’s surface combatant fleet capability in the third quarter of 2023, which could mean cuts to Hunter class frigates. 5. The too-hard or not-yet basket There are 13 recommendations from the review that are agreed only “in principle”. These included: an east coast facility for the nuclear submarines, the location of which will only be decided “late in this decade”; a fuel council to deliver a resilient national fuel supply; a centralised space domain capability and a trained defence space workforce; and integrating long-range anti-ship missiles on to the F-35A. Also in this category is the recommendation to work with states and territories to develop “national resilience and response measures for adverse climate change … without the need of ADF support except in the most extreme emergencies”. “Defence should be the force of last resort for domestic aid to the civil community, except in extreme circumstances,” it said. The government acknowledged that the ADF helping with natural disasters “comes at a cost to force preparedness, readiness and combat effectiveness”, promising to work on it with states and say more in 2024."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/05/my-parents-thought-hard-times-were-long-past-readers-power-cut-preparations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-05T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"‘My parents thought hard times were long past’: readers’ power cut preparations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/my-parents-thought-hard-times-were-long-past-readers-power-cut-preparations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/05/my-parents-thought-hard-times-were-long-past-readers-power-cut-preparations","fields":{"bodyText":"Households across the UK have begun preparing after warnings that the National Grid may impose a series of rolling three-hour power cuts this winter if the supply of gas for power stations falls too low. Some are preparing blackout boxes and buying candles, camping stoves and windup radios. Others are sourcing batteries and generators to keep vital equipment running, including a home aquarium and sensory equipment for an autistic family member. Six people discuss how they’ve been preparing for potential blackouts. ‘I’ve made a blackout box with torches and biscuits for my elderly parents’ Jennifer Bolland, 64, lives a two-hour drive away from her parents, who are 85 and 93, and worries about how they will cope in a blackout. She has been speaking to them about it since September to prepare them: “I don’t know if they are optimistic or can’t believe it. They thought the hard times were long past.” Bolland has made them a blackout box containing “two torches, biscuits, fruit cake” as well as “tea lights properly stuck into aluminium foil trays so they can grip and carry them”. She says: “We’ve practised with the poky straws and ripping the top off of milk. We’ve practised putting the straw in – the squash jumps everywhere but it doesn’t matter as long as they have something to drink.” The couple rely on a stairlift to get to bed, Bolland explains. “If there’s a blackout, they’ll have to sleep where they are. I’ve put blankets and fleeces folded on dining chairs.” Bolland visits them once a month for 10 days. “It’s a case of preparing for what I can and hoping for the best.” ‘I’ve bought warm pyjamas and thermals for my children’ Vanessa Linden, 46, started assembling “all the classic” blackout items in September. “We’ve got a battery-driven torch and radio, stocked up on candles, bought thermal first base layers, fleece slipper boots,” she says. Linden, who works in learning and development in Chiswick, also has supplies of dried and tinned food. With two young children, aged two and four, she worries about safety if she has to rely on candles. She has bought her children thick pyjamas and is concerned about them all staying warm as well, saying that there is a “high probability all four of us will sleep in the super-king bed just for warmth”. “I showed my little children how dark it gets with no lamplight and only candles,” she says. “[But] how long can you realistically keep up the ‘this is an adventure, let’s read with a torch in the tent’ narrative?” ‘I’ve got a windup radio and camping stove’ In September, Joanna Young bought a windup radio, windup torches and a windup lantern in order to be prepared for the possibility of power outages. “The radio has a solar panel, can take AA batteries, has a torch, and a USB port for charging your phone.” Young made sure she had plenty of matches in case the electric ignition on the kitchen’s gas stove didn’t work. Then the 60-year-old from Eastbourne stepped her preparations up, entering what she called “phase two” with a camping stove. “We ordered our single gas ring hob from Amazon and a supply of gas canisters after reading about Yarrow and having become aware of the incidents around Nord Stream. Being of a pessimistic/realistic nature, I started thinking the gas might go as well as electric.” “I’m wondering about what to do about drinking water but wondering if going I’m going overboard at this point,” she adds. ‘I’ve bought a 12v battery to keep my aquarium alive’ Mike Wharton, 37, is the owner of a rare saltwater marine aquarium, which is home to a diversity of species, including fish, corals and invertebrates. “There is a lot of machinery and equipment that is needed to keep it all alive,” he says. “It all requires power. I have some emergency back-up equipment which will keep it going in a power cut for maybe an hour – but after that the system needs power.” Wharton, the co-founder of a digital consultancy from Dundee, recently purchased a 12v battery which he hopes will be able to run off his wife’s Nissan Leaf car. He says: “It should keep it going for about a week. It is concerning me but I live in a part of town where the power isn’t overhead, it comes through ground cables, so I’ve never had a power cut here before.” ‘We keep dry-pack emergency rations on hand’ Lewis, 73, from Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, says he and his husband have been prepared for any power outages for some time, given their backgrounds. “We have [supplies] on hand all the time,” he says. “My husband is from Japan, I’m from San Francisco, so we are both used to earthquake preparedness. “The big difference is that the San Francisco Bay Area doesn’t get as cold as it does here, so heat will remain a problem. But we keep a week’s worth of dry-pack emergency rations on hand. I always make sure I have a week’s worth of medicine. I have bottled water stored, plus chemicals to disinfect it if we needed to. It’s like a church with all the candles we have scattered around the place for the dark hours.” The couple also keep their emergency documents in bags that can withstand water and fire. However, Lewis says he has never had to deal with repeated blackouts before. He says: “I’ve never had to last more than a day. For example, the 1989 earthquake in the Bay Area or shortly after that was the Oakland wildfire. Not terribly long but probably longer than the two to three hours they are talking about in the evenings here. Longer than that but not repeated.” ‘We’ve bought a generator to keep my brother’s life-saving tech running’ Hannah, who is in her early 30s and lives near Glasgow, is an unpaid family carer to her brother, in his 20s, who has autism. He has learning disabilities, is unable to speak and relies on digital technology to communicate with those around him. “My brother doesn’t verbally communicate, he relies on technology to convey the most basic needs, whether it is that he needs to go to the bathroom or if he has hurt himself,” she says. “Due to his epilepsy, we’ve also got sensors around the house in case he has seizures. One in particular is a kind of mat that goes under his bed and will set off alarms in case he has seizures and we can support him. All of this needs to be plugged in or charged with electricity.” Worrying about the potential for blackouts this winter, Hannah and her family have invested in a £300 small generator to use in case of an emergency. “Hopefully it will just sit at the back of the cupboard and not need to be used, but it’s a fair signal of the impact a blackout would have on a family like ourselves. It would last three or four hours,” she says. Hannah adds that she feels disabled people are often overlooked when decisions that will affect them are made by politicians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/dec/15/holly-johnson-the-power-of-love-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-ztt","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T16:08:37Z","webTitle":"Frankie goes to Bethlehem: how The Power of Love became an unlikely Christmas anthem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/15/holly-johnson-the-power-of-love-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-ztt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/dec/15/holly-johnson-the-power-of-love-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-ztt","fields":{"bodyText":"Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s single The Power of Love was never a Christmas song, Holly Johnson complained, when a version was used on the John Lewis festive ad in 2012. He wrote it in 1983 while still on the dole, having given up his art school grant and unsure of his future in music – even though the band were on the brink of success. The song was a paean not to another person, he explained, but to love itself – “a force from above”; death-defying, vampire-smiting. His voice still contained that silvery archness (wasn’t the “hooded claw” a reference to Wacky Races?) but the emotional heft was real. Was this really the guy from Relax? But from day one, Johnson never stood a chance extricating The Power of Love from Christmas. It was Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s third single, and third and final No 1. It had just one week at the top, at the start of December 1984, before Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? knocked it off. After the shock and awe of previous singles Relax and Two Tribes, The Power of Love’s video was a straightforward nativity scene that barely featured the band – “chocolate box”, as Johnson later lamented. While producer Trevor Horn had turned Relax and Two Tribes into special-effects-laden blockbusters, he did very little to The Power of Love in the studio – just speeded it up (you can hear the original, slower version on Frankie’s John Peel session in 1983) and added a lush string section from Anne Dudley of Art of Noise. He says that at the time – and this really dates things – his main worry was how to get a 12-inch out of a ballad when their previous two singles had done so well in remixes. They made an extended version by including a recorded Christmas message called Holier Than Thou in which five drunken Frankies chant a festive rhyme: “Christmas is here once again / So let’s all have some fun / Don’t forget 10 pints tonight / And don’t forget to come – to the lads’ party of course!” The single came at the start of Frankie’s unravelling, when the forces controlling the band were pulling in different directions. Two weeks before its release, adverts from their label ZTT billed it as their “third No 1”. This embarrassed its distributor, Island Records, which was growing weary of the concepts dreamed up by Paul Morley, ZTT’s maverick marketing manager. Horn, the band’s label boss as well as producer, had the musicians in a punishing record deal – and the two “ferocious homosexuals” (their words) and three scouse “lads” that made up the band were becoming aware of their unusually mean royalty rates, and a clause that effectively made it impossible to leave ZTT. Some of Morley’s plans stuck. “I’d always had a little pattern that I’d wanted to pursue,” he says now. “The first three singles would be: sex, then war, then religion.” Morley put out The Power of Love with Titian’s Assumption of The Virgin on the cover. Everyone agreed that there was a heavy Catholic power in the song – they just had different ideas about what to do with it. The video for Relax had been set in a gay S&amp;M club: a large man dressed as a Roman emperor ejaculated on Johnson from an upper balcony. In Two Tribes, the presidents of Russia and the US destroyed each other in an amateur wrestling match. Why follow this with a live-action nativity? “There was a feeling that this was going to be coming out in December, let’s make sure the video is spotless for consumption,” Horn says now: they’d had to reshoot Relax three times. The men to do it were Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, two former members of 10cc, who had formed the most coveted pop-video directing unit of the early 80s and had worked on Two Tribes. “The Power of Love was like the planets aligning,” Godley says. “It’s coming up to Christmas, the song’s about love, what’s the most appropriate thing we could do? We didn’t set out to take the piss. We wanted it to be as genuine as possible, to hit some emotional marks in the song. I think the film amplifies that in a very appropriate way.” Creme remembers it slightly differently. “We were told by Trevor and Paul that it could be Christmas No 1,” he says. “We thought, what’s an obvious thing to be watching while people were having their Christmas lunch? The nativity! We hadn’t actually heard the song. It was a nice change from the mad fantasy shit we’d been doing before. We thought, why don’t we try to be Zeffirelli?” They filmed in the desert outside Jerusalem over one week in autumn 1984. Their “Bethlehem” is an abandoned Palestinian refugee camp: by the time they set up, the breeze-block huts were occupied only by wild dogs. They used local auditions to cast the holy family; several of the shepherds were indeed shepherds. One of the magi, Godley recalls, got the part by claiming to be an expert camel rider: “‘They’re my favourite animal,’ he said. He couldn’t ride one to save his life: we spent hours strapping him in.” Did the locals know of Frankie Goes to Hollywood? “Not a clue,” says Creme. It was a testing shoot. Climbing a sandhill to get the right aerial shot, the crew encountered an unexploded bomb. There were many scattered around – “a nightmare when the camels wanted to sit down” – and members of the Israeli army, who would often drive by in convoy, had no interest in helping to defuse them. One night, Godley and Creme – “a little wiped out” – accidentally drove through a minefield. When they finished their final shot, they lay down in the desert and drank mint tea as the dawn came up. Morley tells me the video was shot in Bournemouth, then phones back minutes later to say his memory has played tricks on him: “It only looked like it was shot in Bournemouth, which is the kind of thing I would have said at the time, because I was so disappointed.” Morley wanted Derek Jarman as director – in fact, he wanted pretty much exactly the same video that Jarman went on to make for Pet Shop Boys’ It’s a Sin in 1987. “I wanted monks and incense, a sense of the gothic – to go that extreme. I wanted the tension between the beauty of the song, and what is spooky about religion: candles, stained glass, dark corners. [But] the result was like wrapping paper.” Straight as it may be, the video creates a strange reverberation, offsetting the ambiguity in Johnson’s voice and broadening the nature of love from romantic to spiritual. Seeing the magi kneeling before the baby Christ – “flame on / Burn desire / with tongues of fire!” – offers a powerful alternative to pop’s usual, worldly, romantic adoring. Quivering shepherds, facing the archangel, were lit by lights rigged up to generators; very loud noises were used to scare the sheep into running. The angel was filmed in London, and the consequent film layering caused a loss of image quality. “The finished thing looks rather pantomimey, rather than like the great Tintoretto paintings we were aiming for,” says Godley. Two weeks before the song was released, there was panic at ZTT that the band weren’t in the video. They were hastily superimposed around the edge of the frame with Holly singing upwards in a strange twist of perspective, as in a painted Renaissance ceiling. Godley recalls getting no creative input from the band. “My ego had taken over by then,” admits Morley, “and it was very normal to commission video makers without the band’s involvement. I am sad about that. I always felt it was Holly’s best song. It just seemed to have come from somewhere else. The beauty and the pain of it, and coming off the world at the time, as it was, with Aids … It seemed to be a desperately beautiful song.” Horn performs a version of The Power of Love with his own band these days. The bit in the original that makes his hair stand on end, to this day, is the way Johnson’s voice soars on the extraordinarily delayed climax. For Johnson, it all still seems painful to talk about. He couldn’t be objective about his non-Christmas song, he said a few years back. In 1988, he took ZTT to court and succeeded in escaping his draconian record contract to pursue a solo career. His own solo version of The Power of Love, released in 1999, remains his favourite. He agreed to talk for this piece, but in the end, he never got in touch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/22/labor-was-presented-with-a-fait-accompli-on-aukus-nuclear-submarines-but-scepticism-in-the-party-is-rightly-rising-kim-carr","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-21T22:57:46Z","webTitle":"Labor was presented with a fait accompli on Aukus, but scepticism in the party is rightly rising | Kim Carr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/labor-was-presented-with-a-fait-accompli-on-aukus-nuclear-submarines-but-scepticism-in-the-party-is-rightly-rising-kim-carr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/labor-was-presented-with-a-fait-accompli-on-aukus-nuclear-submarines-but-scepticism-in-the-party-is-rightly-rising-kim-carr","fields":{"bodyText":"On the morning of 16 September 2021, the federal ALP caucus was presented with the shadow cabinet’s fait accompli of support for the Morrison government’s Aukus submarine deal. Caucus members were told that on the previous afternoon, the leader, Anthony Albanese and several shadow ministers had received a two-hour briefing on the proposal from the government. No documents were provided at the briefing. On the basis of that, and the shadow ministry’s endorsement, Labor MPs were expected to leap into bipartisan support for the Aukus deal. Caucus did not endorse the deal. No vote was taken because a vote was not proposed. The caucus simply noted the report. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup This was to be the biggest procurement in Australian history. Many questions were asked – I raised some of them myself at the meeting. Many remain unanswered. Given the scale and implications of this project and the fundamental assumption that we should be seeking to secure the best technology the country can afford, it is not unreasonable that these questions continue to be raised. The suspension of critical judgment or the signing of blank cheques is simply not reasonable. Much has been said of the historic changes in our region that are claimed to be the basis for undertaking this project. How much of that understanding goes to changes that will not be reversed by wishful thinking of the capacity of great and powerful friends to turn back the tides of history? The US is no longer the region’s unrivalled economic and military power. As a country, we need to be realistic about our own national interests in the new environment. There needs to be equally realistic assessments of the capacity of “great and powerful friends” to prosecute a war in Asia. It is now 20 years since the illegal and catastrophic war in Iraq, into which we were led by accepting spurious intelligence briefings on weapons of mass destruction. In light of that experience, we know that it pays to reflect critically on what we are being told by security agencies. There have been too many occasions where the intelligence agencies have simply got it wrong. Relying on a revamped forward defence strategy, given our historic experience, seems particularly strange. Given the historical patterns that have seen Australia participate in so many regional conflicts since the 1950s, the questions remain as to how our national interest is served by locking Australia into the strategic priorities of the US for the next 50 years, regardless of regime changes in the US, the UK, or our own national interests. The $368bn claimed to be the cost of this project leaves open the question of how we verify the amounts to be spent in Australian rather than American or British shipyards. The issues concerning our own industry development, given the long history of procurement failures, need close scrutiny. The ability to maintain our sovereign capabilities regarding civilian as well as military personnel also needs closer examination. The opportunity costs of other defence procurements that will have to be foregone to fund this project require particular attention. We are entitled to ask: is this the best value for money in the defence of Australia? Time will tell how much of the stated rationale for Morrison’s deal developed at a time of his own political failings, will survive close scrutiny. Given that it has taken us 40 years to develop a low-level waste dump, the establishment of a high-level nuclear waste dump will be fascinating to watch. We’ve seen already the divergence of views among state premiers. But this highlights a much broader problem. Assuming that consensus remains in the US about the export of defence materiel and investment in Australia, the establishment of a regulatory regime in Australia is fraught with profound difficulties. Australians need to understand just how strong the sentiment is in the US for “buying American” and the legal foundations that underpin that sentiment. Significant commonwealth laws regulating nuclear activities will need to be amended. Dozens of commonwealth and state legislative instruments will need to be changed. The most significant at the commonwealth level include the Australian Radiation and Nuclear Protection Act; the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act; the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Safeguards Act and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Act. Will reactors be required on shore for training and research purposes, and will a nuclear reactor at a dockyard meet the criteria of the current legislation? It’s a remarkable proposition to suggest that we can have a nuclear navy without a nuclear industry to support it. To date, the media debate has been profoundly one-sided. That will change as independent expert opinion mobilises to apply appropriate scrutiny to these measures.

Centrica has invested in an industry joint venture which will trial using hydrogen at an existing “peaking plant” at its Brigg station in Lincolnshire, the Guardian can reveal. The pilot, which will launch in the second half of next year, is aimed at examining the role that hydrogen can play in producing power. Peaking power stations generally run only when there is a high, or peak, demand for electricity. The 49MW gas-fired station at Brigg is designed to meet demand during peak times or when generation from renewables is low, typically operating for less than three hours a day. The pilot is one of 20 projects part-funded by an £8m programme from the Net Zero Technology Centre (NZTC), which receives funding from the UK and Scottish governments. Centrica has also increased its stake in HiiROC, the start-up behind the project, from 2% to 5%, a small investment for the £4bn energy giant. In November 2021, HiiROC raised £26m from a collection of investors including Centrica, industrial buyout firm Melrose, investment fund HydrogenOne and carmakers Hyundai and Kia. The project is designed to test to the practicalities of mixing hydrogen in with natural gas at a power plant, with the aim of reducing the overall carbon intensity of the site. In its early stages, just 3% of the gas mix is expected to be hydrogen, rising incrementally to 20%. Partners in the initiative hope ultimately to power the plant using just hydrogen and set a precedent to decarbonise other gas-fired peaking plants. Hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity, with minimal emissions. It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries although there is fierce debate over its use and the motivations of the army of lobbyists pushing its cause in Westminster. HiiROC, founded in Hull in 2019, has developed an electrolysis process using technology that can create hydrogen at lower costs and with lower emissions than other methods. Its process converts biomethane, flare gas or natural gas into hydrogen and carbon black, a byproduct that can be used in tyres, rubbers and printing inks. Greg McKenna, managing director of Centrica Business Solutions, said: “Gas still plays a huge role in maintaining a secure, stable supply of power in the UK, with around 40 per cent of our power coming from natural gas. So, it’s vital that we find ways to reduce the carbon intensity of gas plants like that at Brigg. “We’re delighted to get the grant funding from the NZTC in order to explore the role of hydrogen in providing the low carbon back-up power we’ll need in order to maintain security of supply as more renewable energy comes on stream.” Centrica has notched up bumper profits and reinstated its dividend this year as the price of wholesale gas has soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Centrica is already converting part of the site at Brigg into a battery storage facility designed to store power generated by nearby onshore windfarms. • This article was amended on 24 October 2022.

Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. On Friday, the Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine.

Democratic senators including Tina Smith, Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey and Bernie Sanders, an independent, argued that Republicans are not negotiating “in good faith”. They called into question the GOP’s attempt to apply work requirements to programs like Medicaid and Snap, which provide healthcare and food vouchers for low-income families. “It is unfortunate that Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate are not acting in good faith. Instead, Republicans have made it clear that they are prepared to hold our entire economy hostage unless you accede to their demands to reduce the deficit on the backs of working families. That is simply unacceptable,” reads the letter obtained by the Guardian. The letter has been circulated among lawmakers at a time when Biden has reportedly signaled some support to compromise on work requirements and rules for federal programs. But Democrats are increasingly concerned about what those negotiations could look like and are looking to the 14th amendment, a US civil war-era addition to the constitution, which states that the validity of public debt “shall not be questioned’”. This could potentially allow Biden to override Congress on the grounds that their failure to raise the ceiling is unconstitutional. But Biden previously expressed some doubt on that strategy. “I have been considering the 14th amendment,” Biden said last week. “And a man I have enormous respect for, Larry Tribe, who advised me for a long time, thinks that it would be legitimate. But the problem is it would have to be litigated.” Even so, those behind the letter are up against the Republican party, which has refused to make concessions such as raising taxes on the very wealthy. “We write to urgently request that you prepare to exercise your authority under the 14th amendment of the constitution, which clearly states: ‘the validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned.’ Using this authority would allow the United States to continue to pay its bills on-time, without delay, preventing a global economic catastrophe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/22/coal-fired-power-stations-restarted-again-as-uk-cold-snap-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-22T22:47:09Z","webTitle":"Coal power stations fired up and customers paid to cut energy use in UK cold snap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/22/coal-fired-power-stations-restarted-again-as-uk-cold-snap-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/22/coal-fired-power-stations-restarted-again-as-uk-cold-snap-bites","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain’s electricity generators have been forced to warm up coal-fired power stations for the second time this winter and selected households will be paid to cut their electricity use for the first time as the cold snap persists. With a high-pressure weather system and associated light winds likely to dominate for a few more days, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) said early on Sunday it had asked Drax to start “warming” two of its coal units at its North Yorkshire site and EDF to do the same for one at its West Burton plant in Nottinghamshire to ensure supplies on Monday. The operator added that it was also activating its live demand flexibility service between 5pm and 6pm on Monday. Selected customers will be financially incentivised to cut their consumption between those hours. The request over the power plants followed a similar request in the middle of December, although then the coal-fired stations were not used, as the operator generated enough power from other sources.“Our forecasts show electricity supply margins are expected to be tighter than normal on Monday evening,” the ESO said. “We have instructed coal-fired power units to be available to increase electricity supplies should it be needed tomorrow evening. “This does not mean electricity supplies are at risk and people should not be worried. These are precautionary measures to maintain the buffer of spare capacity we need.” Last summer, amid a peak in gas prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the ESO negotiated a winter contingency contract with a number of coal generators at the request from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “Overall, this is likely to be a challenging winter for energy supply throughout Europe. We have taken extensive measures to try to mitigate the impacts for British consumers and expect that, under our base case, margins will be adequate,” ESO said at the time. Normally there is enough power generated by onshore and offshore wind turbines. However, ESO said it had taken the precautionary step to ensure the lights stayed on as the country gets back to work on Monday. With much of the UK enjoying light winds and a cold sunny Sunday, wind power accounted for just 6.89 gigawatts, about 17.6% of the total being generated. Two weeks ago, on 10 January, British windfarms were producing three times as much power, averaging 21.69GW, and setting a new record. In spite of Sunday’s move to prepare coal-fired units for generation, data shows the UK’s generation is becoming greener. More than 50% of the country’s electricity came from zero-carbon sources in December and another record was achieved on 30 December, with a peak of 87.2% of electricity coming from zero-carbon sources in one day, according to ESO."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/power-outages-puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T10:00:29Z","webTitle":"Thousands still without power weeks after Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/power-outages-puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/power-outages-puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona","fields":{"bodyText":"Alexis Robles has slept a mere three hours a night since Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico on 18 September, causing a total blackout across the Caribbean island. Robles, 52, a systems analyst in the seaside town of Cabo Rojo in south-west Puerto Rico, has been living without power for 25 days. At night, the temperature barely dips below 80F, and Robles wakes up after an hour or two covered in sweat. The days are marked by high temperatures and rain, and without a fan or air conditioning the mosquitoes are unbearable. Robles lives in an 80-apartment condominium complex with a backup generator that produces only enough electricity to power the water pump and light the communal areas after dark. Those with somewhere else to go have left, he says; the remaining residents are just trying to get by. “We have no electricity during the day, people here are desperate, just trying to survive, worried that this could end up like Maria,” said Robles. Fiona, a category 1 storm when it struck the island and the first major hurricane of the 2022 season, hit Puerto Rico exactly five years after hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall two weeks apart, destroying much of the island’s electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, leading to thousands of preventable deaths and the longest blackout in US history. The storm left the vast majority of Puerto Rico and its 3 million residents without power or water for several days. After Maria, Robles and his neighbours were left without power for five months. Now, three and half weeks after Fiona, they have no idea when electricity will be restored. “What infuriates us the most is that Luma is claiming most of the island has power, when that is obviously not true,” said Robles, referring to the private US-Canadian consortium that took over electricity transmission and distribution in June 2021. Luma claims it has restored power to 99% of homes and businesses. But three and a half weeks on, about 20,000 customers – the equivalent of 40,000 people – remain without power, according to the company’s own figures. The worst-affected neighbourhoods are in the south and south-west of the island, where Fiona made landfall. Andrés Gutiérrez, a general physician in Cabo Rojo, said around a third of the town’s 50,000 inhabitants remain without power – including many of his patients. Electricity posts are still down, cables damaged by falling vegetation – which many Puerto Ricans blame on the lack of regular maintenance. “The situation is very tense, people are tired of being stuck in the middle of Luma and political interests. We pay so much for electricity and billions of dollars have gone into the system that is basically obsolete,” said Gutiérrez, 46, who also went five months without power after Maria. Luma claims to have restored power to his street, he said, but half the homes still don’t have any service from the grid and rely on backup generators and solar panels. They are among the lucky ones able to invest in backups after Maria, Gutiérrez said, but for many on low incomes – including some of his patients – this wasn’t an option. “I have diabetic patients living off fast food and bread because the refrigerator is off – it’s causing a domino effect on people’s health,” he said. Over the past two decades, Puerto Rico – along with Haiti and Myanmar – has been among three territories most affected by extreme weather such as storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts, according to the Germanwatch Climate Risk Index, which are becoming more intense due to global heating. As those threats increase, Fiona for many residents has illustrated the ongoing fragility of the island’s energy system – despite the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) having approved an unprecedented $16bn for reconstruction and mitigation. Much of the existing energy infrastructure – plants, transmitter towers, poles and cables – is in flood-prone areas or at risk of sea level rise, storm surges and tsunamis, as well as strong winds and earthquake damage. None of the federal funds have been allocated to distributed rooftop solar – a decentralised energy alternative which grassroot activists and environmental experts argue would be cheaper, cleaner and more resilient. About 10 miles north-east of Cabo Rojo on the outskirts of the city of Mayagüez, another doctor, Alfredo Pérez, is spending more than $40 a day on diesel to power his generator – a polluting luxury that has been in short supply. Pérez, 57, a neurologist, also has many patients without electricity including an elderly neighbour with Parkinson’s disease whose wife is fretting about how long this power outage will go on. “This was only a category 1, and here we are again, 25 days later waiting for answers.” Luma has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/us-clashes-iran-backed-militias-tehran-nuclear-talks-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T22:55:33Z","webTitle":"US says clashes with Iran-backed militias won’t affect Tehran nuclear talks ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/us-clashes-iran-backed-militias-tehran-nuclear-talks-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/us-clashes-iran-backed-militias-tehran-nuclear-talks-biden","fields":{"bodyText":"US-led forces and Iran-backed militias exchanged fire for the second day in a row, but the Biden administration said the fighting would not affect nuclear negotiations with Tehran. US Central Command said the two bases, Conoco and Green Village, used for the US-led mission against the Islamic State (IS) had come under rocket attack on Wednesday evening, but there were no serious injuries. The US struck back with attack helicopters, killing “two or three suspected Iran-backed militants conducting one of the attacks” and destroying vehicles. “The response was proportional and deliberate,” a CentCom statement said. “The United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we will continue to take the measures necessary to protect and defend our people.” US officials have stressed there is no connection between the fighting between the US and alleged Iranian proxies, and the delicate endgame of negotiations to revive a 2015 agreement between Iran and major powers which has largely disintegrated since Donald Trump withdrew the US in 2018. The state department confirmed that the US had sent a response on Wednesday to Iranian proposals on ways to return to the deal. Iran said that it had received the US response and was studying it. Both the US and Iran responses follow a proposed EU blueprint for restarting the nuclear deal, by which Iran would roll back its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. John Kirby, spokesman for the US national security council said Iran had made some concessions which had closed the distance between the negotiating positions but added: “Gaps remain. We’re not there yet.” As the nuclear negotiations appeared to end the final stretch, fighting flared up in Syria, where the US-led anti-IS coalition is in close proximity to Tehran-supported militias in Syria and Iraq. Wednesday’s clash came a day after US airstrikes against targets in Deir Azzour, which Washington said were arms bunkers used by militias affiliated to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). That action was taken in retaliation for drone attacks on US military outposts on 15 August. Kahl said Tuesday’s US strikes had struck nine bunkers, and had originally targeted 11 but people had been seen near two of them. The aim was not to cause casualties but to send a deterrent message, he said. “Our response was extraordinarily carefully calibrated. It was meant to be proportional to the attacks that the Iran-backed groups carried out on 15 August. It was very precise,” he said. There have been a succession of attacks on the residual US military mission in Syria, left behind to monitor and contain the remnants of IS. Kahl said the decision was taken to strike back after the 15 August drone attack in part because wreckage from a downed drone could be traced back directly to Tehran. He added that US airstrikes were also a cumulative response to a series of attacks by Iranian-based militias. “We don’t want Iran to draw the wrong conclusion that they can continue just doing this and get away with it,” he said. He insisted the US military operations in Syria were not linked to negotiations on the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “Whether the JCPOA is reborn or not, it actually has nothing to do with our willingness and resolve to defend ourselves,” Kahl said. “I think the strike last night was a pretty clear communication to the Iranians that these things are on different tracks.” Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said there were signs of anticipation on both sides of a deal being clinched. “The US and Iranian governments have begun shifting the message for their audiences in expectation of something happening,” Geranmayeh said. The Iranian press has noticeably changed tone over recent weeks, swapping nationalistic and anti-western views for more neutral positions on the deal, which Iranian leaders have framed as a pillar of sovereignty. The Israeli government, which has struggled to prevent the JCPOA being reborn, struck a defiant tone as the prospect of a new deal rose. “We are not prepared to live with a nuclear threat above our heads from an extremist, violent Islamist regime,” the prime minister, Yair Lapid, said. “This will not happen, because we will not let it happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/29/plane-review-aviation-fuel-powered-good-time-gerard-butler","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"Plane review – an aviation fuel-powered good time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/29/plane-review-aviation-fuel-powered-good-time-gerard-butler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/29/plane-review-aviation-fuel-powered-good-time-gerard-butler","fields":{"bodyText":"A pilot miraculously pulls off a teeth-rattling emergency landing, only to discover he must rescue his passengers all over again, this time from the lawless separatists and militias that rule the island of Jolo in the Philippines.

Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Keir Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. But Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, said on Sunday that the party had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he said on Sophie Ridge On Sunday on Sky News. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” He said the sector had been promised tens of thousands of jobs in renewable energy “time and time again” but that they “simply have not emerged”, adding: “That has been the sorry state of the renewables industry around the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. “We are against further new licences being granted and that’s because it won’t do anything for bills, it won’t do anything for energy security, it’s not a long-term answer to jobs and clearly it would be a climate disaster,” Reynolds said. “We have got to understand that the opportunity in front of us, the number of jobs created from clean energy, is far in excess of the existing directly employed workforce in North Sea oil and gas.So it’s not some sort of consolation prize, this is the big prize, the big chance to do that, and we will work with Gary in providing this country with a better transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/oct/11/ovo-energy-owes-me-more-than-2000-for-my-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Ovo Energy owes me more than £2,000 for my solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/11/ovo-energy-owes-me-more-than-2000-for-my-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/oct/11/ovo-energy-owes-me-more-than-2000-for-my-solar-power","fields":{"bodyText":"I have had solar panels on my roof since 2011 and used to receive quarterly feed-in tariff (FIT) payments from SSE Energy.

He struggled to contain his emotions as he visualised their final, terrible, minutes on a property in rural Queensland. His tribute was sincere, and moving. Less fine, sadly, was the naked politicking on show over energy price relief, which was the primary reason MPs returned to Canberra out of session. Dutton elected to vote in favour of higher power prices on Thursday because that aligns with a strategic choice he made to resist Labor’s policy prescriptions. Dutton’s political calculation is simple. Looking ahead to 2023, the Liberal leader thinks power bills will go on rising. He’s right about this. The price intervention the Albanese government legislated on Thursday is designed to take the edge off the increases, not prevent them altogether. Dutton intuits a voter backlash once people realise there are no magic wands to fully ameliorate a global energy shock. Any discussion of energy prices also happens in the shadow of the inexorable transition to low-emission power generation. In addition to sustained high prices, Dutton thinks the energy transition Labor has telegraphed is going to be a debacle, because it will be difficult, practically, to roll out the required high voltage transmission infrastructure in an environment of labour shortages and capacity constraints. We know Dutton thinks this, because he’s been saying it for months. I suspect Dutton also thinks Australia’s big emitters will start shouting from the rooftops shortly in the event the government requires them to substantially reduce emissions, as part of the looming overhaul of the safeguard mechanism. In Dutton’s mind, these are elements of a perfect storm. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Right now, things are placid. The bedrock of Anthony Albanese’s political success over the past six months has been toning down the polarisation, the aggro, the rolling contention. Dutton’s objective is to make sure things get hectic. A sustained cost of living crisis, and the lack of simple solutions to it, is an accelerant to stoke voter disaffection about the incumbent government. In saying no to Labor’s legislation on Thursday, Dutton isn’t prosecuting the politics of 15 December 2022. He’s making a calculation about how things will look and sound a year from now. If this sounds cynical, it is. Dutton hid behind process as an excuse for not supporting Labor’s legislation. The opposition couldn’t reward terrible law-making. In fairness to Dutton, the process of drafting the energy price relief legislation certainly would not win any public service prizes. But hectic drafting in a crucible of strenuous third-party lobbying is hardly a unique event in Canberra. As well as his high-minded process objection, Dutton determined there was an important principle at stake. The vibe of the thing was governments shouldn’t stomp around directing play in the gas market, because, hashtag, capitalism. Bear in mind this is the same Coalition that scrapped a market mechanism to govern the energy transition and replaced that framework with its own Soviet-style government interventions, including, but not limited to the “big stick” aimed directly at price gouging energy companies. Just for the record, the “big stick” (whittled down after intercessions from horrified Liberal backbenchers) originally included a divestiture power to break up private companies. There was also that taxpayer-funded underwriting program (now retired by the new government), where the Coalition (as opposed to hashtag capitalism) would determine types of new investment in power generation. If Dutton is now suddenly remembering that market intervention is a terrible thing he’d best wind back the clock 10 years and persuade Tony Abbott not to lead us to the place we’ve landed; the place where sensible national interest policy is constantly hobbled by intra-day politics. That bit of time travel would be a public service. But far from unravelling the harm, Dutton wants to freshen up the climate wars via whatever means. By opposing Labor’s legislation, Dutton made it very clear on Thursday he doesn’t want energy prices that inconvenience the gas industry. He won’t countenance the necessity of fossil fuels having a finite life. The answer to every question, according to Dutton, is more gas supply, even though climate science demands something else. Thursday’s parliamentary debate felt like a hinge point, because it was. MPs were debating a temporary price cap and additional support for low and middle-income households through consumer rebates. This was a consumer Band-Aid in extraordinary times, not a revolution. But everyone in the chamber caught a glimpse of the future. A government with the temerity to inconvenience the gas industry with a modest intervention is a government prepared to walk a path towards the end of fossil fuels. The gas industry can see that too, hence the agitation. At one point on Thursday, Adam Bandt pointed to the elephant in the room. “Today is the beginning of the end for gas,” the Greens leader declared. Bandt is sprinting well ahead of present reality. The “end” of gas has a very long tail. But the point the Greens leader was making is that the zeitgeist has changed. Ten years ago, a Labor government with the temerity to attempt to impose a super profits tax on Australia’s miners was near run out of town by the fossil fuel industry. Ten years ago, Abbott amplified the self-serving bollocks of the fossil fuels industry about carbon pricing to win an election. Voters believed that mendacity, and cast their ballots accordingly. Roll forward through the lost decade, to the present reality of living with a climate crisis, the gas industry finds itself near friendless – apart from the Coalition parties lining up loyally on the wrong side of history. The moral of Thursday is simple. Labor felt on safe political ground inconveniencing the gas industry. Dutton is fully intent on making that ground feel less safe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘No miracles needed’: Prof Mark Jacobson on how wind, sun and water can power the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","fields":{"bodyText":"“Combustion is the problem – when you’re continuing to burn something, that’s not solving the problem,” says Prof Mark Jacobson. The Stanford University academic has a compelling pitch: the world can rapidly get 100% of its energy from renewable sources with, as the title of his new book says, “no miracles needed”. Wind, water and solar can provide plentiful and cheap power, he argues, ending the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis, slashing deadly air pollution and ensuring energy security. Carbon capture and storage, biofuels, new nuclear and other technologies are expensive wastes of time, he argues. “Bill Gates said we have to put a lot of money into miracle technologies,” Jacobson says. “But we don’t – we have the technologies that we need. We have wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, electric cars. We have batteries, heat pumps, energy efficiency. We have 95% of the technologies right now that we need to solve the problem.” The missing 5% is for long-distance aircraft and ships, he says, for which hydrogen-powered fuel cells can be developed. Jacobson’s claim is a big one. He is not just talking about a shift to 100% renewable electricity, but all energy – and fossil fuels still provide about 80% of that today. Jacobson has scores of academic papers to his name and his work has been influential in policies passed by cities, states and countries around the world targeting 100% green power. He is also controversial, not least for pursuing a $10m lawsuit against researchers who claimed his work was flawed, which he later dropped. The evidence that proves he is right is collected in the new book, Jacobson says. Not only is a 100% renewables-powered world possible, it also promises much lower energy bills, he says. The first reason for that is that electrified vehicles, heating and industrial processes are far more efficient than those powered by fossil fuels, where much of the energy is wasted as heat. Add in better-insulated buildings and ending the drilling and mining for the fossil fuels that consume about 11% of all energy, and you get 56% less energy use on average from 2035 to 2050, Jacobson says. Wind and solar energy are cheaper too, so average bills will fall 63%, he says. Jacobson divides approaches to the energy transition into two camps: “One says we should just try everything – they’re the ‘all-of-the-above camp’ – and keep investing huge amounts of money in technologies that may or may not be available to work in 10 years. But 10 years is too late.” Carbon emissions must fall by 45% by 2030, scientists agree, to keep on track for no more than 1.5C of global heating. His camp takes a different approach, Jacobson says: “Let’s focus on what we have and deploy as fast as possible. And we will improve those technologies just by deploying, bringing better solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and so on. Some people just don’t realise the speed that we need to solve these problems, especially air pollution – 7 million people die every year. We can’t wait.” However, there are major barriers to a rapid rollout of a 100% renewable energy system, he says: “The No 1 barrier is that most people are not aware that it’s possible. My job is trying to educate the public about it. If people are actually comfortable that it’s possible to do, then they might actually do it.” He adds: “The policy of all-of-the-above is also a big barrier to a transition. In the US, for example, in the recent [climate legislation], a lot of money was spent on carbon capture, small modular nuclear reactors, biofuels, blue hydrogen. These are all what I consider almost useless, or very low-use, technologies in terms of solving the problems. And yet, a lot of money is spent on them. Why? Because there are big lobby groups.” Another barrier is funding the upfront costs of renewable energy in poorer countries – rich countries need to help, he says. Jacobson believes progress towards a 100% renewable energy system can be fast: “The goal is 80% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. But, ideally, if we can get 80% by 2030, we should get 100% by 2035 to 2040.” Solving the stability problem A big concern about a world overwhelmingly reliant on electricity is maintaining the stability of grids powered by renewables. Where there are large amounts of hydropower from dams this is relatively easy – at least 10 countries already have 100% renewable grids. But in other places reliance on intermittent wind and solar is more challenging. The answer, says Jacobson, is energy storage, managing the demand, and connecting up renewables over wider areas to enable greater continuity of supply. Storage can be batteries, pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air and lowering and raising heavy weights. Jacobson thinks batteries will win, but says others could contribute if they can compete on cost. New research indicates that electric vehicle batteries alone could provide the short-term storage needed by global grids as early as 2030. Jacobson also advocates heat storage for some buildings: “Storing heat in boreholes, aquifers or water pits is dirt cheap, excuse the pun. It’s less than $1 a kilowatt hour of storage.” Managing demand, by varying electricity prices with demand, is already growing fast, he says. When the renewables supply exceeds the demand, the electricity should be used to produce green hydrogen, he says, to power the fuel cells needed by energy-intensive users. “Managing the grid is just an optimisation problem, not a rocket science problem,” he says. “I don’t want to say there’s zero problems, but usually these challenges are ironed out over time just by experience.” Another criticism of a major renewables rollout is the mining required for the metals used. But Jacobson says such a rollout would in fact hugely reduce extraction from the earth by ending fossil fuel exploitation: “The total amount of mining that’s going to be needed for wind, water, solar, compared to [the] fossil fuel system, is much less than 1% in terms of the mass of materials.” Jacobson is scathing about many nascent technologies being promoted as climate solutions. “Carbon capture and storage is solely designed to keep the fossil fuel industry in business,” he says. Only some of the CO2 is captured and buried, he says, and deadly air pollution continues unabated. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil gas with some CO2 then captured and buried, is far inferior to green hydrogen produced directly from renewable electricity, Jacobson says: “Blue hydrogen is just really convoluted.” New nuclear plants are too slow to build and too expensive compared with wind and solar, in Jacobson’s view: “You end up waiting 15 to 20 years longer, for a seven to eight times higher electricity price – it just makes no sense. Even if they improve [build times], say to 12 years, that’s still way too long. We have cheaper, faster, safer technologies. Why waste time?” Biofuels are also dismissed by Jacobson: “The biofuels push was really not helpful. They hold constant, or increase, air pollution and they use a huge amount of land.” He is a little more measured when it comes to direct air capture (DAC): technologies that can suck CO2 from the air for burial. It has no role today, he says, with spending on renewables far more cost effective in cutting emissions. But even when fossil fuel burning ends, many scientists have concluded that CO2 will have to be drawn from the air to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. At that point, Jacobson says, the costs of DAC should be compared with other ways to sequester carbon and limit global heating, such as reforestation and cutting emissions of other more powerful greenhouse gases, including methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilisers. Supporters and critics Jacobson’s book has attracted support from some experts. Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, says the book “presents a comprehensive and detailed blueprint for the options we have right now to address the climate crisis”. Mann has said those insisting we lack the tools to decarbonise the economy today are wrong. Prof Claudia Kemfert, at the German Institute for Economic Research, who has advised the German government and European Commission, says: “[The book] shows impressively that numerous crises can be killed with one stone, without us having to wait for miracles.” But others are critical of a focus on only wind, water and solar. Prof Ken Caldeira, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US, says: “Having a broader set [of technologies] in the toolbox only makes it easier to solve problems. We will only use the tools that it makes sense to use in any particular circumstance, but maintaining and expanding our options is a good thing. “The key question is not what is physically possible in an ideal world, but what is practically possible in the world as we know it,” he says. Prof Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre, is somewhere in the middle of the debate: “I broadly agree that we can largely use existing technologies, but we will need to put those to new applications, such as using bulk stores of hydrogen in order to provide interseasonal storage.” “Moonshot efforts to invent entirely new things are almost certainly a distraction,” he adds. “Jacobson is right that the principal need is to deploy what we have. He is wrong to the extent he makes this sound easy.” Asked about the controversy around his work, Jacobson says: “Usually, the people against us don’t like the fact that we don’t include their technologies.” On the lawsuit over a critical paper, he says: “That was not a question of a scientific disagreement.” He claims it was an attempt to protect his reputation. He dropped the case in 2018. Jacobson remains optimistic: “There is a technical and economic solution to the climate, air pollution and energy security problems we face. But we do have major challenges in trying to implement that solution. The challenges are getting the political willpower to focus on a narrow set of solutions that we can implement quickly. The vested interests are very much a problem because they are pushing this ‘all of the above’ approach.” No Miracles Needed: How Today’s Technology Can Save Our Climate and Clean Our Air by Mark Z Jacobson is published by Cambridge University Press on 2 February 2023, £11.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/afternoon-update-keating-calls-aukus-submarines-worst-deal-in-history-power-prices-to-surge-and-violet-cocos-sentence-quashed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T05:51:05Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Keating calls Aukus submarines ‘worst deal in history’; power prices to surge; and ‘Violet’ Coco’s sentence quashed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/afternoon-update-keating-calls-aukus-submarines-worst-deal-in-history-power-prices-to-surge-and-violet-cocos-sentence-quashed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/afternoon-update-keating-calls-aukus-submarines-worst-deal-in-history-power-prices-to-surge-and-violet-cocos-sentence-quashed","fields":{"bodyText":"Happy hump day! Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating was taking no prisoners today, blasting the Aukus submarine deal as “the worst international decision” taken by a Labor government in a century. “Look, I’d say for the cost – $360bn – for $360bn, we’re going to get eight submarines. It must be the worst deal in all history,” he said in a blistering appearance at the National Press Club where he insulted journalists and chided his Labor colleagues for “essentially [accommodating] the strategic wishes of the United States, uncritically”. In a stinging rebuke of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, Keating said she had allowed the military to overtake foreign policy in determining the China relationship. “Running around the Pacific islands with a lei around your neck handing out money, which is what Penny does, is not foreign policy. It’s a consular task,” he said. “The Albanese government does not employ foreign policy.” He added that China posed no threat to Australia and that aligning with the British, after the UK had abandoned Australia’s defence in the 20th century, was “deeply pathetic”. Read the full wrap of Keating’s comments by our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, or watch a two-minute clip of his remarks. Top news Malaysia warning on Aukus | Malaysia has urged Australia, the UK and the US to refrain “from any provocation that could trigger an arms race or affect peace and security in the region”, in a statement issued in response to the Aukus deal. Meanwhile, South Australia, where the nuclear-powered submarines will be built, has pushed back on nuclear waste being left in the state. As part of the Aukus deal, Australia is responsible for any nuclear waste generated by the submarines. Power bills to surge | Electricity bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The Coalition jumped on the news, accusing the Albanese government of breaking its election promise to lower power bills. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, was quick to point out that the rises would be higher were it not for the government’s price caps introduced at the end of last year, and that direct relief would come in the May budget. Queensland is already a step ahead, announcing today a rebate to come in the next financial year. ‘Violet’ Coco’s sentence quashed | The NSW district court has overturned a 15-month jail sentence imposed on the climate protester who blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a truck in April 2022. The original sentencing last December drew attention to the state’s harsh anti-protest laws, including condemnation from the UN. Catholic church abuse | The church is hoping to use the deaths of paedophile clergy to stymy more than a dozen cases brought by historical abuse survivors, an analysis of court records suggests. The strategy, largely adopted in New South Wales, relies on a key decision last year in the state’s highest court, which found the death of Father Clarence Anderson, an abuser long known to the Lismore diocese, rendered the church unable to fairly defend itself against allegations of abuse. NSW police officer stalked woman | Joshua Alan James Wootton, 32, has pleaded guilty to stalking a woman over a period of 11 days in February 2022 and searching for details about her partner using the restricted Cops database. Wootton will face a sentence hearing on 9 June. Tasmanian devils overwhelming possums | The introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island has halved the population of brushtail possums. Don’t be alarmed – researchers say the possums had expanded beyond their usual habitat and restoring a top predator like the Tasmanian devil has helped keep them in check. Massive EV parking fines | If you happen to park your car in an EV charging space, you could be in for a hefty fine. States and territories have been introducing fines, starting with $3,200 in the Australian Capital Territory, $2,875 in Queensland, $2,200 in New South Wales and $369 in Victoria. The Cyclone Freddy death toll | … has passed 200 as people in Malawi and Mozambique pick up the pieces after the record-breaking storm. Rescue workers warned that more victims were likely as they scoured destroyed neighbourhoods for survivors. Honduras to switch ties from Taiwan to China | The Central American country’s switch would leave Taiwan with formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries. China has intensified pressure to reduce Taiwan’s international standing, and this morning flew 28 military planes across the Taiwan strait, 16 of which crossed the median line.

What they said … *** “We’ve heard so much about how tight the budget is, and it is … And we’ve heard that we can’t spend money on things that are really important to our communities and to our country. And this [Aukus] is a massive spending commitment for decades to come.” – David Pocock The independent senator questioned how the government intends to finance the massive defence spend, calling on Labor to axe the $243bn stage-three tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, repeated his refusal to scrap the tax cuts. In numbers And about 42% of men reported experiencing physical violence since the age of 15, according to the latest ABS data.

You can also read our full report by our New Zealand correspondent, Tess McClure. Before we close down our live blog, here is a quick summary of today’s developments. Thank you for reading today, and take care out there. As heavy wind and rain from ex-Cyclone Gabrielle battered the North Island overnight, residents awoke on Tuesday to roads eaten away by landslips, collapsed homes buried in mud, people trapped on rooftops, fallen trees and power lines, flood waters blocking roads and communities stranded. The New Zealand government declared a national state of emergency – only the third time in the country’s history (the previous occasions were in response to the 2019 Christchurch attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic). The areas worst-affected by the storm appear to be around the east coast and far north of the North Island. At least 2,500 people have been displaced and 225,000 left without power. New Zealanders were told that power might not be restored to some areas “for days to weeks”. High winds prevented helicopter rescues of people trapped in homes and vehicles. Authorities are “really concerned” about the Hawke’s Bay settlement of Wairoa, which remains cut off from communications. A firefighter is missing after a landslide in Auckland’s Muriwai destroyed a house he was checking. As parliament briefly returned (it has now been postponed for the week), the climate change minister, James Shaw, made a furious speech excoriating parliament for lost decades of “bickering” over the climate crisis. Air New Zealand cancelled all domestic flights in and out of Auckland on Tuesday afternoon. Cyclone Gabrielle is gradually moving south-east away from New Zealand, but the risk of landslides is expected to remain high, particularly if the rain continues. If you have been personally affected by the disaster, and are in a safe place to communicate, we would like to hear from you. Some numbers out of the latest briefing from the prime minister: 2,500 displaced and evacuated in the cyclone. That number is the first estimate the government has provided, and is subject to change, as there are still areas where communications are down. 225,000 people without power across the North Island. Some may remain without power for weeks, the national grid operator has said. 1,842 incidents recorded by Fire and Emergency related to Cyclone Gabrielle – at this stage, FENZ is only responding to incidents that represent a risk to life. 200 defence force personnel deployed so far, with 22 army vehicles on the ground $11.5m rolled out by the government to community groups and providers responding to the crisis – this figure does not capture emergency response, evacuations or the cost of the wider response. 2 active rescue operations under way to try and access those trapped by rising flood waters. 1 missing person reported: a firefighter remains missing after a landslide in Muriwai destroyed a house he was checking. The government is “really concerned” about Wairoa, a settlement of about 8,600 in Hawke’s Bay that has had a blackout of all communications including satellite phones. McAnulty said: We’re aware of some flooding but we’re not aware of to what extent - and until the weather clears and we’re [able to] either re-establish communications or get people on the ground, we don’t have a full understanding of the impact there. That makes us feel anxious and it makes us feel concerned. We are really concerned about that. We want to establish links soon as the weather allows us to do so – there are plans in place to get that under way. Orchard workers stranded on rooftops in Hawke’s Bay There are two active rescue missions under way in Hawke’s Bay. One is a group of orchard workers who were initially trapped on top of rooftops when flood waters rose. McAnulty said there has a helicopter operation to rescue them, but it had been hampered the weather. “They have been stranded for quite some time,” he said. “There’s been a real delay because of the weather – even an NH 90 [military helicopter] couldn’t get to them.” Risk of landslides to remain despite ‘calmer weather’ on the way The cyclone is now gradually moving south-east away from New Zealand, and the weather should begin to calm over the next day, the prime minister has said – but he warned that the risk of landslides could stay high, especially if rainfall continues. “A bit more rainfall can compound on top of the rainfall that we’ve already seen – so when it comes to things like slips and so on, we could still see more of that even as the weather starts to ease,” Hipkins said. “We’re still in for a bumpy, bumpy time ahead. “The good news is that we should see some calmer weather coming within the next 24 hours or so.” These are the first estimates the government has provided on displaced people. Minister Kieran McAnulty says: “We’re only working on estimates here because there are still areas we were struggling to communicate with.” But the government know of 2,500 people – about 1,000 in the far north, about 1,000 in the Hawke’s Bay and about 400 households in Auckland. Hipkins said that number may shift, as there are are still large areas of the North Island that are unreachable by road or telecommunications. Australia and UK offer support to New Zealand New Zealand has received “offers of reassuring support” from the Australian government, and Hipkins says he has spoken today to UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who also offered the country’s support. Damage to power grid not seen since Cyclone Bola in the 1980s The damage to New Zealand’s power grid is extensive, the prime minister says, with damage not seen since Cyclone Bola in the 1980s. He says a grid emergency is still in place, with electricity supply completely lost to the Hawke’s Bay and Gisborne and “potential outages for an extended period of time”. Approximately 225,000 customers have been out without power across the North Island. The situation is changing rapidly and the lines companies are expecting that there could be more customers to be affected. The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is speaking now. He says the government is still trying to assess the extent of the damage, but says it is already the biggest weather event to hit New Zealand this century. We are still building a picture of the effects of the cyclone as it continues to unfold. But what we do know is the impact is significant and it is widespread. Cyclone Gabrielle is the most significant weather event New Zealand has seen in this century. The severity and the damage that we are seeing has not been experienced in a generation. Prime minister to provide update on storm We’re expecting a briefing from prime minister Chris Hipkins and emergency response minister Kieran McAnulty in the next 10 minutes or so, and will bring you the latest updates from parliament. Footage of a submerged truck shows the dramatic rise of flood waters sweeping vehicles and outdoor furniture away in Puketapu, Hawke’s Bay. Tongan workers on New Zealand’s North Island had a little over 40 minutes before flood waters forced them to seek refuge on the rooftops. You can watch the scene unfold in the video below. Severe wind warnings are still in place for chunks of the North Island, with some areas experiencing unrelenting gales. MetService has reported 30 consecutive hours of gale-force winds at the top of Northland. Photos show rescue of sailor stranded on yacht in cyclone The dramatic rescue of a stranded sailor from a yacht caught adrift at sea has been captured in a series of images published by New Zealand’s defence force today. The boat had been in trouble off the coast of Great Barrier Island since Monday night when its anchor cable snapped. The yacht, with sailor on board, was grounded and then swept out to sea. No air assets were able to reach the vessel at the time due to the severe weather,” the NZ navy said in a statement on Tuesday. “After searching for the vessel overnight, Te Mana received new details about the location of the vessel after an emergency locator beacon was activated.” The sailor was pulled safely from the boat and on to Frigate HMNZS Te Mana by navy divers. MetService has shared a series of satellite images above New Zealand from 9am Tuesday morning. It shows strong winds moving clockwise around Cyclone Gabrielle. Aotearoa New Zealand correspondent for the Guardian, Tess McClure, has written about the extraordinary speech given by the climate change minister, James Shaw, in parliament today as Cyclone Gabrielle devastates the country. His furious speech excoriated the New Zealand parliament for lost decades of “bickering” over the climate crisis. Shaw, who is co-leader of the Green party, attributed the scale of the disaster to the climate crisis, saying: “There will be people who say it’s ‘too soon’ to talk about these things … but we are standing in it right now. This is a climate change-related event. The severity of it, of course, made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees. “We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.” You can read the full story here: At 3pm (0200 GMT) Cyclone Gabrielle was around 160km (100 miles) south-east of Auckland, near the east coast of the country’s North Island, and is expected to continue moving south-east, roughly parallel to the coast, Reuters reports. Weather warnings remain in place for much of the east coast of the North Island and upper South Island. Kieran McAnulty, minister of emergency management, said that while New Zealand was now through the worst of the storm, more rain and high winds were expected. The country was suffering from extensive flooding, landslides and damage to roads and infrastructure, he added. Residents describe fleeing at night Agence France-Presse writes about the extent of the damage unfolding in the North Island: This is only the third time New Zealand has declared a state of emergency – following the 2019 Christchurch attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic. Daylight [on Tuesday morning] revealed the severity of the disaster: roads eaten away by landslips and collapsed homes buried in mud, silt and a slew of storm detritus. Falling trees smashed power lines and flood waters blocked several roads, leaving communities across the country’s north stranded. Local media reported some were forced to swim from their homes to safety. Others waded through stormwaters on foot. “At about midnight we got the emergency text saying ‘evacuate’,” recalled Jane Scott, a resident of coastal community Muriwai, who gathered a torch and a few essentials before seeking refugee in a local community centre. “It was pitch black and pouring with rain,” she told local channel TVNZ. “It was very scary.” Wellington whipped by 146km/h winds The storm is also lashing the southern parts of the North Island, with the New Zealand Herald reporting 146km/h wind gusts at Mount Kaukau in the northern suburbs of Wellington. “Wind speeds appear to be increasing along with heavy rainfall – and the council is starting to receive reports of trees toppling and flooding,” said Chris Mathews, Wellington City Council’s resilience manager. Wellington residents have been advised to hunker down. Air New Zealand has also advised that all domestic flights in and out of Auckland have been cancelled for the remainder of Tuesday and is expected to affect around 55 flights. Auckland airport said ground handling operations (baggage loading/unloading) have needed to pause “due to wind speed on the airfield, and the need to protect the safety of airport workers”. Here are some of the images we have received over our news wires this afternoon. A total 225,000 people across the country are now without power, the energy minister, Megan Woods, has told reporters. “This is the largest disruption to electricity infrastructure since [the 1988] Cyclone Bola,” Woods said. Tell us: have you been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand? We would like to hear from you if you have been affected by the disaster and are in a safe place to communicate. Please do not take any unnecessary risks in order to contact us. We would particularly like to hear from those who are in or in contact with those in the areas that appear worst-affected: Northland, Tolaga Bay, Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, west Auckland and Coromandel, but also those affected throughout the country.

Do you live abroad but have loved ones in New Zealand who are affected? How do you feel about the response so far from the authorities? You can use the form here to send them to us. Before parliament adjourned to focus on crisis management, New Zealand’s climate minister, James Shaw, has had some stern words to say about the government’s “inaction” on climate change. As I stand here today, I struggle to find words to express what I am thinking and feeling about this particular crisis. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as sad or as angry about the lost decades that we spent bickering and arguing about whether climate change was real or not, whether it was caused by humans or not, whether it was bad or not, whether we should do something about it or not, because it is clearly here now, and if we do not act, it will get worse. Shaw then quoted Winston Churchill, saying: “The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedience of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.” He continued: There will be people who say it’s ‘too soon’ to talk about these things ... but we are standing in it right now. This is a climate change-related event. We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now. A road has collapsed on Auckland’s Āwhitu Peninsula after a massive landslide hit the area. The collapse happened on Lighthouse Road, caused by relentless heavy rain that’s lashed the North Island in recent days. Images supplied to various local media outlets and shared online show the extent of the slip on the peninsula. Parliament to adjourn early as MPs respond to ‘most severe weather event that New Zealand has experienced this century’ New Zealand’s parliament will adjourn early to allow MPs to focus on the cyclone and work in their communities. The House had its first sitting of the year today, and House leader and finance minister Grant Robertson moved that parliament adjourn until Tuesday the following week. Cyclone Gabrielle represents the most severe weather event that New Zealand has experienced this century,” he said. I know that all parties would rather that we were able to carry on, but in the circumstances facing many New Zealanders today, whose lives and livelihoods have been devastated, the right thing to do is to do our jobs and our communities and return here next week. MetService has issued its latest weather update, predicting more heavy rain and damaging winds to batter many parts of northern and central New Zealand. Overnight and this morning, significant rain and wind affected large parts of the North Island, especially in the north and east with Tairāwhiti/Gisborne cut off. Large waves, storm surges and coastal inundation are affecting exposed eastern coasts of the North Island. Wind gusts over 140km/h have been recorded at many exposed coastal locations, but urban areas have been affected too, with New Plymouth airport gusts reaching 128km/h. Wave heights close to 11 metres were recorded off the coast of the Bay of Islands. Napier airport had its second wettest day on record with 175mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. That’s more than three times the February average. The North Island has seen significant and widespread damage with large areas without power or communications, major flooding and wind damage in many regions. Over 30 state highway closures and the shutdown of air, sea and rail transport for much of the northern half of the North Island. Several communities and regions are isolated. Wind gusts in excess of 120km/h over parts of the upper North Island, Taranaki and central New Zealand are expected, and warnings are still in place. Our New Zealand correspondent Tess McClure brings us this report from Hawke’s Bay, a region on the east coast of the North Island that has been badly battered by the severe weather. Adrianne Mason, of Esk Valley in Hawke’s Bay, says the flooding in the area is “catastrophic”. Mason’s 22-year-old daughter had to climb out of her bedroom window in the early hours and swim to safety as flood waters rose. Neighbours at an adjacent house were trapped on their roof by rising flood waters. They have since safely self-evacuated to a home on higher ground, but still cannot be reached by rescuers, as the river has washed out roads. “We were prepared for the cyclone but not for the Esk River to burst,” Mason said. Their newly built home had been immersed by flood waters, and she says other houses surrounding the river appeared to be destroyed. “Our brand new house is completely flooded, our son’s house is flooded. But other properties on the other side of the Esk river have lost their houses completely,” she said. “Our family is OK, so we are lucky.” In their most recent update, Fire and Emergency said multiple people in the Hawke’s Bay were trapped awaiting rescue in vehicles, houses and on roofs. “Helicopters aren’t currently able to rescue people trapped on roofs due to the high winds,” they said. Graph shows extent of rainfall so far this year A graph of yearly accumulated rainfall at Auckland airport shared by New Zealand’s weather forecaster MetService shows a significant spike in rainfall when compared with previous years. A total of 540mm was recorded, or about half (48%) of the annual rainfall expected to be recorded by the site in just 45 days. About 113 people were forced to reside in civil defence centres and shelters overnight, Auckland emergency management’s deputy controller Rachel Kelleher has told a briefing this afternoon. Those who sought shelter included those who were evacuated and those who felt unsafe in their homes. Power out in 44,000 Auckland homes Around 44,000 homes are currently without power in Auckland, Vector chief operating officer for electricity, gas and fibre, Peter Ryan, told a briefing today. Ryan said crews were working tirelessly to restore power and urged residents to “please bear with us”. Ryan also urged people to avoid fallen lines and damaged electrical appliances and to treat all lines as live. 1,800 storm-related incidents logged in 24 hours Fire and Emergency New Zealand deputy national commander Steph Rotarangi has said firefighters have been extremely busy across the country, with 1,800 storm-related incidents logged in the 24 hours up to 2pm. There has been a rapid increase in calls for help in from residents in the Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti regions, Rotarangi said. The deputy national commander also provided an update on the missing firefighter after an incident in Muriwai overnight. Rotarangi said crews attending a routine flooding call when a landslide trapped two firefighters. One firefighter was found early on Tuesday morning but the second firefighter “has not yet been found” she said. A firefighter is missing and another is in critical condition after a house collapsed in West Auckland, the New Zealand Fire and Emergency services has said. Kerry Gregory, chief executive of the fire service, said a volunteer fire brigade was investigating a flooded house on Motutara Road when a landslide hit the property. “It’s been a tough night for the North Island as a whole, but it’s been especially tough for fire and emergency,” said Gregory. Eva Mueller, who lives a street over from Motutara Road, said she was shaken by a loud noise in the night. We heard a very big crack and bang sound and of course we didn’t know what it was, but obviously it would have been that slip and trees and the house coming down,” she told Stuff.co.nz. The state of national emergency has been widened to include the Tararua District. The declaration now covers Northland, Auckland, Tairāwhiti, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, and Hawke’s Bay CDEM Group areas and the Tararua District. The state of emergency declaration indicates who is administering the response – shifting responsibility to the national government, rather than regional authorities. So while it’s called a state of “national” emergency, it’s not nationwide. It also allows the government to quickly allocate financial resources and coordinate defence forces for evacuations. More than 150,000 homes and businesses are without power across the North Island at the moment, most of them in Northland, Auckland and Hawke’s Bay. That number doesn’t include Gisborne, Tairāwhiti and Bay of Plenty, where communications and power are understood to be down completely, so the total figure will be much higher. Due to those comms and power shutdowns, we haven’t been able to contact the local distributor to get the latest figures; they last issued a press statement last night when outages were in the hundreds. In Auckland, the distributor Vector said the severe gales pummelling the city “are hampering our efforts to restore power to thousands of people, with crews needing to stand down at times for their own safety”. “One crew has had to abandon their vehicle in rising floodwaters and others have had to stop restoration efforts at various times through the night and morning,” the company said in a statement. Areas of North Island worst-affected by cyclone Here’s a map indicating the areas believed to be worst-affected by Cyclone Gabrielle at this stage – by no means exclusively. Access and telecommunications are cut off to Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, the Coromandel and Hawke’s Bay, so it’s very difficult to assess the extent of damage there. In West Auckland and Northland, there are extensive areas of flooding and landslides. New Zealand’s national power grid operator has declared a “grid emergency” and warned that power might not be restored to some for “for days to weeks, rather than hours”. The widespread power cuts in Hawkes Bay and Bay of Plenty happened after a substation flooded during severe rain from Cyclone Gabrielle. “Due to the current situation, we are not able to obtain communications from our substation, but it is likely the Redclyffe substation is under water,” the company said in a news release. Nothing would be done to restore power until Transpower is sure the situation is safe for workers on the ground, the statement said. The electricity distributor Powerco said nearly 30,000 customers were without power an hour ago – mostly in Coromandel, Taranaki, Waikato and Bay of Plenty. The Hawke’s Bay lines company Unison listed “widespread” outages on its website affecting tens of thousands of customers in Napier and Hastings. High winds prevent rescues of people trapped in homes and vehicles Multiple people are still trapped on roofs, in vehicles and in homes by flood waters, with helicopters unable to reach them due to high winds. According to Fire and Emergency NZ, multiple people on state highway in the Hawke’s Bay are trapped in vehicles and in houses, and people are trapped awaiting rescue in Puketapu. There are also many houses flooded in Eskdale and Whirinaki which can’t be reached by road as the bridge access is washed out. “Helicopters aren’t currently able to rescue people trapped on roofs due to the high winds. This is an ongoing situation and we are monitoring it closely,” they said in a statement. New emergency evacuations launching as flood waters continue to rise. In the Hawke’s Bay, civil defence told residents “evacuate immediately… Go immediately to the nearest hill… Take grab bags and animals”. That order currently applies to residents in Waiohiki, Omahu, Taradale, Jervoistown and Meeanee. “Flood protection systems on the Tūtaekurī River are failing to contain flood waters,” they said. Climate change minister James Shaw on the cyclone’s effects: “This is climate change.” Widespread flooding in Napier Some images here of the very extensive flooding in Napier, which has washed out bridges and inundated homes. Social media images and video have emerged from that area of people sheltering on roofs and houses being washed away. Hipkins says New Zealand has to re-evaluate where it builds communities Hipkins says the recovery is likely to be lengthy, with some people displaced for a long time. We know that this won’t be an overnight recovery. It’s going to take a while some people will be displaced from their homes for an extended period of time,” he says. Our focus right now is on the immediate response – it’s on making sure that people have a roof over their head, that they have a meal, that their families are well-cared for. That’s the that’s the immediate focus. The recovery effort is something that we will absolutely be placing front and centre of the government’s program over the next few weeks and months. He’s also indicated that this extreme weather event – and others like it – have to change how and where New Zealand builds its communities. We need to look at the sustainability of some of the places where we have built previously … We’ve got a long history of poor past decisions in New Zealand that we’re confronting right now. Hipkins says Cyclone Gabrielle is “an extreme weather event … probably the biggest that we have seen in recent times comes, and it comes hot on the heels of other extreme weather events.” A number of the regions worst-effected were still in the process of cleanup from devastating flooding a fortnight ago when the storm hit. He says it is still too early to provide any figures on the number of people displaced or injured. PM warns of ‘extensive damage done across the country’ The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is giving an update now on the emergency response. He says the government is still trying to track the extent of the damage. “It will take us a while to get a handle on exactly what’s happened,” he says. “A lot of families displaced, a lot of homes without power, extensive damage done across the country.” Kieran McAnulty, New Zealand’s minister for emergency management, says the worst of Gabrielle may be over, but more rain and high winds are expected. “[While] we are through the worst of the storm itself, we are all facing extensive flooding slips, damaged roads and infrastructure,” he said on Tuesday morning. “Our message to everyone affected is safety first: look after each other, your family and your neighbours.” If people were facing dangerous conditions, he urged them to proactively evacuate: “If you are worried about your safety, particularly because of the threat of flooding or slips, then don’t wait for emergency services to contact you, leave and seek safety.” The national state of emergency – a designation that has only been used in New Zealand twice before – is a “significant legal instrument”, McAnulty said, allowing the government to send more resources to affected regions with “a nationally coordinated approach”. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Cyclone Gabrielle. I’m Tess McClure, I’m based in Auckland, and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they come in. Here is what we know so far: The government has declared a national state of emergency, only the third time in New Zealand history it has done so. The declaration was made at 8.43am and means the response will now be coordinated by the central government rather than local authorities. Damage and flooding is extensive, and the worst-effected areas appear to be on the east coast and far north of the North Island. Bridges and roads have been washed away, houses submerged and landslides have destroyed homes with some people sheltering on roofs and awaiting rescue. Some communities have been cut off entirely, with power, road access and mobile networks down. Officials say Tairāwhiti/Gisborne is currently only reachable by satellite phones. Conditions are impeding some rescue and evacuation efforts, with roads cut off, and the weather affecting helicopter flights. Two firefighters were trapped in a landslide in Muriwai while checking a home – one is in a critical condition and the other still missing after search was suspended due to the instability of the land. There are more than 120,000 homes are without power across the North Island. The power outages are also affecting mobile networks in some regions. The government has urged people at risk to proactively evacuate: “If you are worried about your safety, particularly because of the threat of flooding or slips, then don’t wait for emergency services to contact you; leave and seek safety.” Some communities are covered by mandatory evacuation orders, and in some regions, theNew Zealand Defence Force is evacuating residents. Red weather warnings for winds and rain are in place in Northland, Taranaki and Auckland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/31/israeli-arabs-netanyahu-election-jewish-supremacists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T17:38:45Z","webTitle":"Israeli Arabs may be the last defence against Netanyahu’s return to power | Lloyd Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/israeli-arabs-netanyahu-election-jewish-supremacists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/israeli-arabs-netanyahu-election-jewish-supremacists","fields":{"bodyText":"On 1 November, Israel votes in a general election for the fifth time since spring 2019. Recent polls show that the country’s former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his rightwing coalition are just shy of clinching victory. Sixty-one seats in the Knesset, the 120-seat parliament, is the magic number. As fate would have it, Israeli Arab voters may determine the outcome. In 2021, Israeli Arabs were instrumental in ousting Netanyahu from office. This time, however, they may give him a boost by simply sitting on their hands: if they stay at home, the odds of Netanyahu and his allies returning to power markedly improve. Reports are already pointing to an expected low turnout. Israeli Arabs possess the right to vote and, on paper, many of the same rights as Jews. They constitute a fifth of Israel’s population and are citizens. But in the words of the US-based Council on Foreign Relations, they “face widespread discrimination”, and many self-identify as Palestinians. In the 21st century, being an Englishman or an American could mean being something other than white and Protestant. Israeli, on the other hand, remains synonymous with Judaism. The words to Hatikva, the national anthem, make that clear. “As long as in the heart, within, / The soul of a Jew still yearns,” it begins. “An eye still gazes toward Zion,” it continues. “To be a free nation in our land, / The Land of Zion and Jerusalem,” it concludes. In 2018, Israel enacted the Nation State law, which demoted Arabic from an official state language. So the urge to abstain from voting possesses a certain logic. Those who advocate boycotting the election see themselves as rejecting Israel’s legitimacy, and that of local Arab-Israeli political leaders, a sentiment I heard as I spoke to students on the campus of Haifa university. With the Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan being party to the Abraham Accords, any arguments questioning Israel’s existence sound like a bitter denial of reality. Direct Arab-Israeli involvement in the political system, however, has yielded its own disappointments. In 2021, Mansour Abbas, an Israeli Arab, brought his Ra’am party into the governing coalition led by Yair Lapid, the current centrist prime minister, and Naftali Bennett, his nationalist predecessor. “The state of Israel was born as a Jewish state, and the question is how we integrate Arab society into it,” Abbas announced at a December 2021 business conference. To many, he had betrayed the Palestinian dream. By summer 2022, Abbas and his party were out, the value of their foray into Israeli politics hotly debated. On one hand, Abbas had succeeded in obtaining funding and infrastructure projects. On the other, the Arab parties had failed to stay the government’s hand in the West Bank or Gaza. Abstentions, however, could have serious consequences: the empowerment of unvarnished Jewish supremacists. Some might even equate that with cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face. The alliance known as Religious Zionism, a political aggregation of neo-Kahanists, would probably be handed the levers of power in a Netanyahu-led government. In return, they would support short-circuiting Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption and bribery trial. Itamar Ben-Gvir, who heads the bloc, has expressed support for a “retroactive French law” that would bar criminal investigations of a sitting prime minister. Talk about a quid pro quo. Ben-Gvir is overtly hostile to Israeli Arabs, and has little regard for liberal norms: he is a populist to his core. His supporters in Jerusalem are young and audible. They view him as an immovable impediment to Netanyahu bringing Arab parties into the government, a possibility that the former prime minister previously entertained. As a younger man, Ben-Gvir was a follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, a US export who ran foul of the law in both countries. Until recently, a portrait of Baruch Goldstein, the perpetrator of the 1994 Hebron massacre and another US export, hung in Ben-Gvir’s living room. Recently, he raised the possibility of deporting Arab-Israeli politicians deemed to be disloyal. By contrast, Jewish politicians would not be subject to such sanction. He has also pledged to go easy in cases involving Israel’s military and law enforcement, The convergence of Ben-Gvir’s and Netanyahu’s ambitions and intentions is overt. On Sunday, Ben-Gvir demanded to be named public security minister. Israel’s police fall under his remit of choice. Netanyahu quickly signalled that he was game: “Ben-Gvir will be a minister in the government only if I form it.” Imagine if Donald Trump Jr were running the FBI for his dad. All this leaves Israeli Arabs in a quandary. On election day, every vote will count – including, or even especially, those not cast.

Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. Concerns are mounting over the toll on households this winter as new forecasts showed annual energy bills are forecast to top £4,200 from January, triggering a warning that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” without government intervention. The deepening energy crisis has piled further pressure on the Tory leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, who are split on how to support households struggling with the rising cost of living. Under the forecasts, which government sources insist are highly unlikely to materialise, the power shortfall could total about a sixth of peak demand even if emergency plans to fire up retiring coal power plants are enacted, Bloomberg reported. In that scenario, a reduction of electricity imports from Norway and France, combined with low temperatures, would force the government to enact emergency measures to conserve gas for four days in January. Under the plan the network operator would initially override commercial agreements to direct flows of gas on the system. After that, supplies to gas-fired power stations would be halted, leading to power cuts for businesses and homes. Rail services could even be hit if electricity is rationed, because the railway is one of the biggest industrial users of power, sources said. Officials are concerned that the UK may have to rely more heavily on piped gas shipments from Europe at a time when gas exports have already been curbed and the continent is scrabbling to rebuild its own supplies. European nations have been embroiled in a dash for winter gas since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with volumes in gas storage reservoirs running well below historical levels. The Kremlin-controlled firm Gazprom has reduced gas deliveries to Europe since the war began while countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian gas to cripple the country’s economy. The war has sent gas prices soaring and sparked concerns over shortages of power across Europe this winter. A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government prepares for “all and every eventuality” based on “made-up scenarios” but it was unlikely to come to pass because of the UK’s “highly secure and diverse gas and electricity system”. They did not deny that the worst-case scenario modelling had been undertaken but highlighted that the most extreme situation of Norway turning off all its gas to the UK was “extreme” and “never going to happen”. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow secretary for climate change, said: “Whilst the Tories squabble over tax cuts, Britain is now readying itself for catastrophic power cuts this winter. This is a complete disgrace to a British public already struggling at the hands of an absent government that has left our economy in tatters. “What we are faced with is the result of 12 years of Tory government which has failed to prepare and refused to invest, leaving bills higher and our country less secure.” Concerns over winter blackouts have intensified this week after Norway threatened to ration electricity exports. The UK receives hydroelectric power from Norway through a subsea interconnector cable running beneath the North Sea. However, water levels in southern Norway have been so low this year that the country’s government could put its own consumers ahead of international customers. On Tuesday, the owner of British Gas, Centrica, signed a £7bn deal to bolster its gas supplies as European energy companies attempt to replace Russian fuel. Centrica has signed an agreement with America’s Delfin Midstream to buy liquefied natural gas from the US’s first floating export facility. However, the 15-year deal does not begin until 2026. Peter Matejic, the chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity that aims to tackle poverty, urged the government to tackle rising energy bills. He said: “The payments promised by the government earlier in the year offer some help but their scale has been overtaken by events, and they must now be at least doubled if they are to protect people from serious hardship on a massive scale.” Officials in Westminster have also been deliberating whether to introduce a campaign to urge consumers to use less energy this winter. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said the scenario was not something that was expected to happen, adding: “We are not dependent on Russian energy imports unlike Europe. “Households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","fields":{"bodyText":"Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of engaging in “terrorist attacks” with its missiles and Iranian-made drones, while British ministers attended emergency meetings in Washington on how to counteract them. Zelenskiy tweeted: “Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country.” Attacks on civilian infrastructure meant there was “no space left for negotiations with Putin’s regime”. The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Russia has been targeting Ukraine with a mixture of missiles and, more recently, Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 of the drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. It was “not in doubt”, the official said, “where these weapons were coming from”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he would ask Zelenskiy to cut diplomatic ties with Tehran – while presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak asked what Iran had got in return from Russia, speculating that it could be uranium, “nuclear technologies”, or some other guarantee. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. Germany said that Iran should be punished with “further sanctions” after the recent spate of drone attacks. Its ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, said Tehran had helped Russia “terrorise civilians in Ukraine with their kamikaze drones” and there were “worrying reports” that Iran might sell missiles to Moscow. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. A western official said a lot of colleagues within the western alliance were “looking at what the right package might be to support the Ukrainians”. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Two “objects of critical infrastructure” were damaged in Kyiv on Tuesday, said the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and electricity and water supply in “many houses” in east Kyiv was “partially limited”. The mayor appealed to residents to conserve electricity by turning off air conditioners, electric kettles and microwaves, and said houses experiencing reduced water pressure should use water as “economically as possible”. All of Zhytomyr was without electricity and water after a double missile strike on an energy facility, said the mayor, Serhiy Sukhomlyn. Hospitals were running on backup power, he said. Russia said on Tuesday that its forces were maintaining strikes against military and energy infrastructure targets, and that it had used what it described as high-precision, long-range air- and sea-based weapons. The targets were “military command and energy infrastructure of Ukraine, as well as arsenals with ammunition and foreign-made weapons”, it said. “All assigned objects were hit,” it added. Klitschko said a fifth person, an elderly woman, had been found dead after a wave of drone attacks in the centre of Kyiv on Monday morning. She died after a residential building was hit by a drone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/power-not-history-is-driving-chinas-stance-on-taiwan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:03:50Z","webTitle":"Power, not history, is driving China’s stance on Taiwan | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/power-not-history-is-driving-chinas-stance-on-taiwan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/power-not-history-is-driving-chinas-stance-on-taiwan","fields":{"bodyText":"Zheng Zeguang, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, parrots the standard People’s Republic of China talking point that “Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China’s territory since ancient times” (Taiwan is now a touchstone issue for the UK, the US and for us in China. This is how we see it, 16 August). The island of Taiwan has indeed been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, but the Han Chinese only started settling there in the late 13th century. This hardly counts as “ancient times” in terms of the 3,200-year recorded history of China (dating from the earliest Chinese written documents, the oracle bone inscriptions), not to mention the much, much earlier history of continuous settlement in mainland China, for which there is ample evidence in archaeological records. In any case, political boundaries have been fluid throughout history, and part of being a mature culture involves understanding that point. The PRC needs to grow up. There are too many more pressing problems in the world today to countenance the sort of childish nationalistic movements that, lamentably, are too widespread at the moment, and of which China’s behaviour towards Taiwan is a prime example. Richard Sproat Tokyo, Japan • Taiwan was never an integral part of China “since ancient times”, as claimed by Zheng Zeguang. In ancient times, Taiwan was inhabited entirely by Austronesians who found their cultural links to the island peoples to the south and east. When the Dutch set up their small colonial operations in southern Taiwan in the early 17th century, occupying a tiny area, there was little Chinese presence on the island. After the Dutch were ousted by Chinese rebel forces, looking for a safe haven, Taiwan remained on the very edges of Chinese rule for a century and a half. It became a nominal province only at the end of the 19th century, and then grudgingly so. When Japan defeated China in the first Sino-Japanese war (1895), Beijing handed over Taiwan (but not its north-east provinces) to Japan “in perpetuity”. The PRC’s current claim to Taiwan is built on fabrication and distortion. Joseph R Allen Professor emeritus of Chinese literature and cultural studies, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities • Chillingly, Zheng Zeguang fails to make any mention of the will and desire of the 23 million inhabitants of the vibrant democracy that is the island of Taiwan. As a former resident of many years, I am still in regular contact with family and friends there, and the groundswell has never been stronger for maintaining the current status quo, as a minimum. The proportion of locals wishing for reunification with the mainland has shrunk dramatically since witnessing at close hand the outcome of the “one country, two systems” approach applied in Hong Kong. In the latest white paper on Taiwan published by the Chinese, the removal of a key phrase that the Chinese government will not send troops or administrative personnel to be stationed in Taiwan shows that this not about reunification; it is about the invasion and suppression of what is in essence a sovereign state. We should do all we can to prevent Xi Jinping adopting this destructive path merely to enhance his political legacy, à la Putin.

Which is one reason why British artist Matthew Krishanu’s sparse, dreamlike paintings of young brown boys roaming free and having adventures in subtropical climes – loosely based on himself and his brother as children – feel so fresh and compelling. “The motivation even to represent these figures,” Krishanu says in his London studio, “and have them on the walls of galleries around the world, is a response to the historical disempowerment of the brown figure, and of children, within western art.” Childhood and the histories of empire are central themes for the artist, who was born in Bradford to an Indian mother and white British father and lived from the ages of one to 12 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where his parents worked as missionaries. These experiences have been distilled into ethereal vistas of the brothers boating, exploring landscapes of rushing water and purple mountains, as well as interior scenes of missionary activity in Dhaka. His forthcoming exhibition Playground, at Niru Ratnam gallery in London, extends the theme of childhood within an urban environment. Paintings of children on a climbing frame, balancing on a wall or standing on a veranda line his studio walls, beckoning the viewer into their out-of-time universe like alluring memories one can’t quite place. At the show’s core is the titular canvas Playground, from 2020, depicting a brown and a white child on a seesaw, supervised by a standing woman in a sari on one side and a white man on the other. It might be a portrait of childhood innocence, yet the positioning of the white child in the ascendant over the brown one is disquieting, evoking the violent history of imperial powers using Asia as their play arena. These undercurrents are subtle yet implicit: Krishanu steers clear of didacticism, more interested in conjuring lived experiences and sensations in his atmospheric work. Figures are fluidly captured, with economy of detail. “I want the faces to be open enough to be many different people’s children, as opposed to the absolute particular,” he says. Specificities of location and time have been pared back, imbuing the paintings with what he calls “presentness”. Krishanu builds his worlds from multiple sources. “For me,” he explains, “it’s about constructing something somewhere between imagination, art history, and then potentially a source material, like a photo.” One wall of his studio is taped with printouts of images from his extensive archive, testament to his continuing dialogue with art history. They currently include an Egyptian Fayum mummy portrait, a fragment from the Ajanta cave paintings in India, Gainsborough’s The Blue Boy, Rembrandt’s The Polish Rider and an El Greco Christ on the cross. The artist points to two paintings of four boys and four girls by Edvard Munch that fed into his recent work Four Children (Verandah, 2022), but he has complicated the group’s dynamic by reconfiguring it as two European girls and two brown boys. In all his canvases, the children are treated with gravity, not sentimentalised. “There’s a certain kind of authenticity to their play that I want to portray,” he says. “The children have an interior life and a power.” In Boy on a Climbing Frame, the subject stands tall, anchored only by the curving frame, wearing a self-possessed, earnest expression as he looks down at the viewer. In contrast, the adults exude a certain awkwardness, especially the white foreigners, such as the man in Playground sporting a green lungi. “In a way,” says Krishanu, “any white person in India or Bangladesh is immediately playing something of the role of the foreigner or the European, however they position themselves.” This notion of adults performing culturally constructed roles is even more pronounced in the recent series Mission, in which his own father is portrayed as the outsider, theatrically dressed in clerical robes, preaching to a Bengali congregation. With characteristic understatedness, the Mission paintings convey Krishanu’s ambivalence about Christianity, particularly the way it has been hijacked by European powers as a tool of imperialism and represented in western art. “The thing I really internalised was the depiction of European figures in the Bible,” he says, recalling the leaflets of blond, blue-eyed children and western depictions of the disciples given out to Bangladeshi kids at a communion service. “Art history has constructed so much of our collective unconscious,” he adds. Ideas about race, history and religion underpin Krishanu’s practice but ultimately what makes his paintings so beguiling is their ambience of childlike wonder. By juxtaposing real elements, such as climbing frames and seesaws with expanses of gossamer-like pastel washes, he infuses his canvases with an elusive otherworldliness. We discuss the similar lure of Narnia and the “lovely numinous pagan heartbeat” of CS Lewis’s Chronicles, a staple of Krishanu’s childhood. “The numinous and the landscape,” he says, “are very much about transporting the viewer, while also being anchored in the organic qualities of the paint – what a drip is, what a transparent veil of paint over white is. That’s the wonderful duality of a painting.” • Playground is at Niru Ratnam gallery, London, 10 November to 14 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"‘It’s madness’: Ukraine holds breath as Putin turns nuclear plant into frontline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","fields":{"bodyText":"On one side of the Dnieper River is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, visible in the haze. Six nuclear reactors and a cooling tower loom over a Soviet-built reservoir. On the opposite bank is Nikopol, a city in southern Ukraine known for its Cossack past and modern tube and metallurgical factories. The distance between them is seven kilometres. Or, measured in rocket terms, about 15 seconds: the time it takes for a Grad missile fired by Russian soldiers ensconced in the atomic station to slam into Nikopol’s chestnut tree-lined boulevards. It is a small and terrifying interval between life and death. The sprawling nuclear plant is Europe’s largest. In March, Russian forces seized it, as part of Vladimir Putin’s blitzkrieg operation to capture the whole of Ukraine. They rolled into the nearby city of Enerhodar and took the station’s local staff hostage. The plant is now on the frontline between Russian-occupied and Ukrainian-controlled territory. In the first phase of the war Nikopol was peaceful, a place of safety for refugees from the eastern Donbas and other troubled regions. And then, on 12 July, Moscow began lobbing incendiary devices across the river. The Russians are using the nuclear station as cover. They have mined the complex. Multiple rocket launchers and tanks nestle among the reactors. Even by Putin’s amoral standards, it is an astonishing act of recklessness. In his latest address on Friday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of “unconcealed nuclear blackmail”. A “terrorist state”, it was threatening the “whole world” with armageddon. He urged the UN and international community to do something. On Friday, Russia’s permanent representation in the UN, Vasyl Nebenzia, said the country did not support a call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to create a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant. The situation is perilous. According to Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, Russia has fired on the plant several times. Shells landed close to the fire station and director’s office, not far from a radioactive sources storage unit. Power cables and a wastewater pumping station were damaged. One worker was hospitalised, a shift rotation cancelled. Moscow blames Ukrainian artillery and claims it is acting responsibly. Zelenskiy suggests the Russians are shelling the plant as a deliberate provocation, designed to discredit Kyiv and to alienate it from its international partners. The Guardian did not see any evidence in Nikopol of Ukrainian military activity. There were a few thumps in the distance. It was unclear which side was firing. The Kremlin is trying to do something unprecedented: to steal another state’s nuclear reactor. Engineers are working to connect the facility to the electricity grid in occupied Crimea and cut it off from Ukrainian homes. One reactor has already been knocked out. It is a ghoulish game of radioactive Russian roulette, in a country that has known the 1986 Chornobyl atomic disaster. Before the invasion Nikopol was home to 106,000 people. About half have fled. On Thursday more were packing up to leave after a devastating and vandalistic night-time barrage. Russia unleashed 120 Grad missiles on the district, killing three people in Nikopol and another 13 in the neighbouring town of Marhanets, and wounding dozens, including a 13-year-old girl. All were civilians. At number 22 Viktor Usov Street, rescue workers were sifting through the debris. A corner had been gouged out of the five-storey residential building, as if clawed by some monstrous hand. Police had sealed the area off with tape. The remains of a rocket lay serenely on a grassy verge, broken in two: a motor and a tail section complete with fins. “It was midnight. The rocket fell on the apartment next to me. We managed to pull the mum and son out alive. But the elderly father, Anatoliy, was already dead. He was under 2 metres of concrete,” resident Vitaliy Chornozub told the Guardian. He added: “The Russians are fucking pederasts. They bring pain, dirt and tears. I can’t understand why they did this.” Another neighbour, holding a cup of coffee after a sleepless night, offered an explanation. “It’s jealousy,” Yana Sokolova said. “They can’t accept the fact we live better than they do. We are free. Russians are slaves. They want to make us slaves as well.” She added: “Putin is a terrorist. We will never surrender. His attempt to bully us won’t work.” Sokolova said she would stay put, despite the early morning attacks, which have led some residents to drive out before evening curfew and spend the night in tents, set up among sunflower fields. The Grad knocked out the internet connection in Sokolova’s apartment but did not damage her ground-floor shop, she said. “We are tired. But our boys are standing firm,” she added. It is unclear why Russia began offensive operations from inside the nuclear station and the adjacent settlement of Vodiane. One explanation is Moscow’s grandiose war is beginning to falter. Six months on, Russian troops have seized much of the east of the country, including the entirety of the Luhansk region, and a chunk of Donetsk. They are grinding forward, slowly and brutally. In the south, however, Russia suddenly looks vulnerable. Since July the Ukrainian army has used US-made precision-guided Himars weapons to destroy four key bridges over the Dnieper River. And on Tuesday Kyiv struck deep behind enemy lines, wiping out Saky aerodrome on the west of Crimea, destroying at least eight war planes, and prompting thousands to flee back to the Russian mainland. A Ukrainian counter-offensive looks possible, though not inevitable. Until it happens, Russia can use Enerhodar as a full-scale military base, as it did with Chornobyl during the first six weeks of the conflict. Russia’s nuclear agency Rosatom says it is now in charge of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency has demanded access, and called on the Russians to demilitarise it. “It’s complete madness from Russia. They know the Ukrainian army can’t fire back,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, 40 miles north of Nikopol. Vilkul, a former deputy prime minister responsible for emergency situations, said Russia had become a “totalitarian sect”, run by a mad dictator obsessed with his place in history. “It’s a strange cult. There is Lenin and victory in the second world war and a religious faith in the nuclear arsenal. Their god is the nuclear button,” he said. He added: “Putin doesn’t really care about Russia. He wants to take his place alongside Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Stalin”. How would the war end? “Like Hitler, Putin will destroy his own country,” he predicted. Further up Ustov Street, another Grad had punched a Lego-like hole into a third-floor flat. Its owner, Alexsandr Suvorov, said he had been at work on his computer at midnight when he heard the sound of an outgoing missile. “I knew they arrive from Enerhodar so I immediately moved into the next room. Suddenly, the door blew past me,” he recalled. Showing photos of the wreckage on his mobile phone, Suvorov said he had been extremely lucky. The Guardian met him in the local administration building as he filed a police report. It was unclear when compensation might be paid, or where he might live now. “I would like to leave. It’s very dangerous. First I need to get plywood to cover up the hole,” he said. Other residents were not as fortunate. A rocket landed on a block where most of the tenants were elderly people, killing a woman. A crane was parked up outside; municipal workers trying to make the building safe threw masonry down from a ruined upper storey. Three schools and more than 40 private buildings were damaged, as well as cars and shops. “This is the reality we live in. We don’t know if we will wake up the next day,” said Anna Sidilova, the property’s manager. “Peaceful people live here. They didn’t have any weapons. They just want to live in their own homes.” What did she think of Putin? “He should be punished the same way, according to world law. He should be deprived of everything he has.” Just across the road a Grad had landed on Nikopol’s Soviet war memorial. There was a deep crater in the alley of glory, not far from a needle-shaped monument and a wall inscribed with the names of soldiers who fell during the second world war. The strike spoke to the ideological vacancy of Putin’s Ukraine invasion, ostensibly carried out to protect Russian speakers and to return a wayward province to its historic Russian and Soviet roots. Nobody knows when, or indeed how, Europe’s bloodiest conflict for 80 years will end. For now, Ukrainians are reacting with defiance, bravery and even humour to the carnage and horror around them. At a checkpoint between Nikopol and Dnipro, someone this week erected a tombstone by the side of the road. It had Putin’s face on it and a date, 1952-2022. Fresh earth had been shovelled to make a faux grave. The slab said in Ukrainian: “Vladimir Putin. Go fuck yourself. Never forgive and never forget.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/nov/28/gianni-infantino-fifa-world-cup-2022-qatar","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T22:00:09Z","webTitle":"Infantino is the nowhere man in this bonfire of greed, vanity and despotic power | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/gianni-infantino-fifa-world-cup-2022-qatar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/nov/28/gianni-infantino-fifa-world-cup-2022-qatar","fields":{"bodyText":"Today I feel … largely invisible. Today I feel like a boggle-eyed despot-groupie. Today I feel like essence of human avarice distilled through a series of filters, poured into a dark suit and presented on stage looking like a discredited small-town mayor with a secret. Today I feel like I really should, for the sake of world football, start to get a grip on this chaotic Fifa World Cup. It is hard to know whether Gianni Infantino feels any of these things right now. It is nine days since Infantino delivered his opening press conference speech, his Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock moment, his I Have a Really Horrendous And Deluded Dream. For all its hallucinogenic qualities, that speech suggested Fifa’s president intended to run this World Cup under strict standing orders. However, in the days since, the most notable aspect of Fifa’s presence at its own super-show is its diffidence. Infantino has gone into stealth mode. Fifa itself has seemed marginalised. An organisation defined by control-freakery, its tendency to assume quasi-governmental powers while hovering over its host like an alien tripod, has gone quiet. Even worse, this has happened just as fires have begun to break out across this thing. A cast ranging from an angry Carlos Queiroz, to the massed brain-shouts of social media, to Infantino himself, has continued to debate the rise of the global south and the decadence of Europe, as expressed via World Cup group standings. Mohammed bin Salman continues to circle the feast. Antony Blinken has used Wales versus the USA as a platform to present to the world Uncle Sam shaking hands with its keenest current Middle Eastern ally. And right now Qatar 2022 feels less like the usual soft-power stage, more like a kind of real-time super-Davos, Yalta with a K-pop soundtrack. Is this really the moment for a closed-circle monarchy to start driving the world’s greatest sporting spectacle? There have been no more public Fifa briefings in Doha. This is not unusual as tournaments go. But it is unfortunate given the many issues arising. Reporters and football administrators have spoken of being passed back and forth between host nation and governing body, questions left unanswered. Fifa’s handling of the informal/nonexistent semi-ban of rainbow items has involved vague, delayed statements. There is a sense of waiting always for the nod from the Supreme Delivery Committee. Nobody puts Gianni in the corner. Except, it would seem, Hassan Abdullah al-Thawadi, chief executive of Qatar 2022, who some say is having a significant final pass on key details that affect supporters, federations, world football generally. The past few days have seen confusion over the right to express even the most broadly sketched political views, most notably the spectacle of stadium guards taking away Iranian protest flags. Fifa’s statutes contain a commitment to “respecting all recognized human rights” and “striving to promote the protection of these rights”. This is in effect part of Infantino’s job description. And yet it seems T-shirts with words as inoffensively universal as “Women” and “Freedom” are now banned in Fifa-land. Meanwhile Iran and Qatar share the world’s largest gas field. You really think you’re in control? The end result is a dangerous and rancorous mess. Fifa and Qatar always looked the perfect fit, the perfect master and client-state. In the event Qatar appears to have overwhelmed its enablers, seized the starship controls and confined the captain to his quarters. At times one half expects to find Qatari government officials out there sternly pronouncing on refereeing appointments, player of the match gongs and the fact Gareth Southgate MUST now pick Phil Foden or squander a golden legacy. This matters, because it is getting hot out here. The soundtrack of Qatar 2022 is a glaze of hope, love, We-Are-The-Dreamers stuff, undercut by a babbling undertone of anger and macro-grudges. This runs right from Queiroz and Jürgen Klinsmann going toe-to-toe over cultural slights, to Serbia’s dressing-room flag reclaiming Kosovo, to John Herdman’s statement (Why John, why?) that Canada would “fuck” Croatia, to government ministers on all sides wading into the cultural frictions. Fifa has bowed to Qatar’s will on the armband-of-love, even as Qatari officials wear their Palestinian rights symbols in the seats. LGBTQ+ bodies have called on Infantino to speak out, to feel as gay as he did nine days ago when he stood before the world as Football Jesus and promised love, harmony and a level of basic governance. Instead Fifa’s most recent public guidance on all this is to announce that Germany are under investigation for not putting a player up at their press conference; and that the media need to use cabled internet connections as the press box wifi is in crisis. Thanks for that. Meanwhile Infantino sits on top of this bonfire of greed, vanity and despotic power like a boggle-eyed Guy Fawkes mannequin, occasionally paraded about the place in his wheelbarrow or allowed to stand in the VVIP box and crunch his toffee apple for the cameras. This leadership vacuum matters beyond simply the chaos on the ground. Fifa’s unchallenged primacy, its endless growth, is not a given. There has already been talk of some European nations getting itchy feet. Plans have been mooted now and then for a European and South American breakaway. Money, and the ongoing primacy of money, suggest the World Cup is too valuable to nobble itself in this way. But bridge-building and concessions are part of its success. Nothing lasts forever. Infantino was supposed to be a technocrat when he took the top job, a safe-ish pair of hands after the debauchery of the Blatter years. He has turned out to be something much harder to gauge. Who is this person anyway? A despot’s glove puppet? An oleaginous pinocchio? A highly competent dissembler, smart enough to give a speech the western media see as deluded, but which was also perfectly pitched towards the Fifa members who will keep him in power? With Blatter there was evidence of simple human vanity, the dreams of a Nobel Peace Prize and so on. The question of what Infantino wants is less clear. One remarkable aspect of Qatar’s control of this World Cup is that Infantino has not blinked, has not wavered in his total support. Either he simply loves power, or those powers have a degree of leverage over him that is not immediately clear. More likely this game is being played at a level beyond such petty concerns as order on the ground. There may be fraught and divisive days in store before the final whistle. But Fifa is still expected to rake in a record $7.5bn (£6.3bn) from this messiest and most divisive of World Cups. Saudi Arabia 2030 seems to be hardening as a possibility every day. Ignore the white noise. Just keep your eyes on the balance sheet. You get the leaders you deserve, or in football’s case the leaders your leader most wants to stand next to. Either way the global game has never looked quite so managed and muzzled and at the same time so out of control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-17T02:12:50Z","webTitle":"Glimpse of first North Korean ‘spy satellite’ in new Kim Jong-un pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","fields":{"bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has inspected North Korea’s first military spy satellite and given the go-ahead for its “future action plan”, according to state media. Kim met the “non-permanent satellite launch preparatory committee” on Tuesday before viewing the satellite, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. A month ago, Kim said construction of the satellite was completed and gave the green light for its launch. That report came about a week after Pyongyang launched what it said was a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile, marking a major breakthrough in its banned weapons programmes. ICBMs and space launch capabilities use shared technologies. The satellite appears to be a polygonal cylinder, covered in gold insulating foil and fitted with solar panels. The photographs have been partly blurred. Kim was pictured a month earlier at the “National Aerospace Development Administration” (Nada) in front of a screen showing something similar in shape, also blurred. On Tuesday, “after acquainting himself in detail with the work of the committee, [Kim] inspected the military reconnaissance satellite No 1, which is ready for loading after undergoing the final general assembly check and space environment test”, KCNA said. Kim accused the US and South Korea of escalating what he called “confrontational moves” against the North and said his country would exercise its right to self-defence. Kim then “approved the future action plan of the preparatory committee”, KCNA added. The development of a military reconnaissance satellite was one of the key defence projects outlined by Kim in 2021. In December 2022, North Korea said it had carried out an “important final-stage test” for the development of a spy satellite, which it said it would complete by April this year. At the time, experts in South Korea quickly raised doubts about the results, saying the quality of black-and-white images released by North Korea – purportedly taken from a satellite – were poor. Pyongyang has not provided a launch date, though Kim said in April that the satellite would be sent up “at the planned date”. North Korea in 2022 declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear power, seemingly ending the possibility of denuclearisation talks. Pyongyang would struggle to do satellite reconnaissance with its own technology and without technological help from Russia or China, analysts say. Still, “since North Korea’s reconnaissance satellites are an important factor in the event of a nuclear pre-emptive strike, they pose a significant threat to the South”, Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP last month. In an address to South Korea’s parliament on Wednesday, Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his country was ready to increase military engagement to mitigate threats to regional security, including from North Korea. Washington and Seoul have ramped up defence cooperation in response, staging joint military exercises with advanced stealth jets and high-profile US strategic assets. North Korea views such exercises as rehearsals for invasion and described them as “frantic” drills “simulating an all-out war” against Pyongyang.

Ten years and several prime ministers after developers first broke ground at a ceremony attended by David Cameron, One of Europe’s biggest brick buildings is set to open to the public on 14 October, with 254 apartments, as well as restaurants, bars, offices and a glass elevator that takes passengers to an eyrie on top of the north-west chimney. Immortalised on a Pink Floyd album cover that featured flying pigs, and on screen in The King’s Speech and Ian McKellen’s Richard III, the building is an enduring feature of the Thames skyline but until now its interior has been off limits to most visitors. A free “festival of power” will celebrate its latest incarnation, bringing to an end a long period of speculation during which developers variously proposed turning the derelict site into a giant theme park or a stadium for Chelsea football club. For half a century, the power station burnt coal to generate as much as a fifth of London’s electricity, keeping the lights on in Buckingham Palace (codenamed Carnaby Street 2 in the control room) and the Houses of Parliament, before puffing its last plumes of smoke in 1983. Now it is the centrepiece of a 42-acre site, nestled beside apartment blocks designed by the US architect Frank Gehry in his distinctive style with fragmented forms, and one large, bendy structure designed by Foster + Partners. The project is owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors led by SP Setia and Sime Darby Property, which bought the site in 2012 for £400m after its owner had gone into receivership. They embarked on a £9bn revamp, divided into eight phases. About 1,600 of the planned 4,000 homes have been built so far. The vast, cavernous spaces of the two turbine halls are now filled with restaurants and shops including Ralph Lauren, Mulberry and Reiss, as well as Uniqlo, Mango, Superdry and Swatch. A floor above Levi’s, the former control room B has been turned into a slick bar, which has the original stainless steel control panels and switch dials for managing the flow of electricity. Apple will relocate more than 1,500 employees from offices around London to its new UK base inside the boiler house, across six floors. Its chief executive, Tim Cook, who had a private tour of the building last week, said: “Once a source of energy for much of London, the transformation this building has undergone honours London’s past and celebrates its future. We’re so glad to be a part of it.” IWG, which operates the office rental brands Regus and Spaces, will welcome tenants on flexible lets from next April in the art deco-inspired Engine Room, with river views. It expects “high demand” from hybrid workers. Luxury apartments line both flanks of the main building, above the shops, and 90% have been sold. They start at £865,000 for a studio, while the 18 sky villas – three- and four-bed penthouses with private terraces arranged around a communal roof garden on top of the building – cost up to £7m. With only a handful of the villas taken so far, the marketing of these pricier homes is still at full pelt. The man in charge of bringing in the buyers is Simon Murphy, the chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, which was set up by the Malaysian consortium. “The ones that are left to sell are the bigger units, which always sell at the end,” he said. “In the past 18 months, we’ve sold over £600m of residential, largely to Brits.” The first residents moved in during May 2021, and the new Battersea Power Station tube stop, which sits on a spur of the Northern Line, opened in September last year. When the site is complete, it is expected to house 25,000 people and attract 25 million to 30 million of visitors every year. It is a big bet during a cost of living crisis. “We continue to be confident,” said Murphy. “We’re not blind to the fact that the world is in a difficult space at the moment and has been for a long time.” The Malaysian owners expect to receive £100m a year in commercial rent from the first three phases of the project. When architects WilkinsonEyre embarked on the redesign a decade ago, the power station had been reduced to a shell, without a roof. There was grass growing on the ground in the middle. Sebastien Ricard, the project director, said: “We were stunned by the scale of the building and wanted to retain it. We didn’t want to over-restore it.” While the four chimneys had to be replaced, with reinforced concrete replicas, many of the original features of the power station were retained – including the two control rooms, one with art deco flourishes and herringbone parquet floor, the other in more brutalist, 1950s style, as well as ceramic wall tiles, exposed steel girders, remnants of staircases and the former directors’ entrance. Cranes have been incorporated into the design, with one holding a footbridge spanning Turbine Hall A. Critics point out that there is little affordable housing, and none inside the power station. Aside from the luxury pads, the developer has built a block of 386 affordable homes, some distance from the power station on the other side of the main road. They make up less than a tenth of the total planned for the site. They range from studios to one- and two-bedroom flats, a mix of social rent and shared ownership, and are managed by Britain’s biggest housing association, Peabody. Not everyone is impressed. Keith Garner, an architect based in Battersea, said: “Forty years to create a shopping mall! Battersea power station should have taken its place alongside other great cultural institutions of London: British Museum, South Kensington museums, Tate Britain and Tate Modern. “But to achieve that they would have needed a different business model, a more hybrid solution involving trust ownership that would have made it eligible for lottery funding alongside commercial tenants.” Instead, alongside the shops and offices, there will be a boxing gym, cinema and private members’ club, and a glass elevator dubbed Lift 109 for the height of the chimney it serves. Passengers are meant to stay inside once it reaches the top, looking at the view for a few minutes, before descending again. However, when reporters were given a sneak preview, the lift rose and then shot straight back down (twice). Something to do with the wind, apparently. The developers will want to fix that before the grand opening. • This article was amended on 5 October 2022 to refer to Battersea Power Station as one of Europe’s biggest brick buildings, rather than its biggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/16/as-charles-is-bestowed-with-mystical-powers-so-much-for-a-secular-coronation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-16T06:31:03Z","webTitle":"As Charles is bestowed with mystical powers, so much for a secular coronation | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/as-charles-is-bestowed-with-mystical-powers-so-much-for-a-secular-coronation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/as-charles-is-bestowed-with-mystical-powers-so-much-for-a-secular-coronation","fields":{"bodyText":"‘God of love, we raise to you our Queen Consort”: for anyone who has longed to mention Camilla Parker Bowles to the most high but struggled to find the words, the Church of England is here, with a set of new prayers, to help. Will they work? Given the impressive pace of her ascent from dedicated fox-chaser to – after years of regular Anglican invocations – near deity, it seems almost blasphemous to ask. In 1996 more than half of England’s bishops thought Camilla and Charles should never marry. When, in 2005, they did, in a register office, 73% of those polled were opposed to her becoming queen. Although the late queen then denied Camilla the bespoke name checks in Anglican worship enjoyed (until their withdrawal in 1996) by Charles’s first wife, she did enjoy inclusion in regular state prayers for “all the royal family”, followed by her 2022 orison upgrade, one that can still shock unwary congregants out of a spiritual reverie: “Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless Camilla the Queen Consort.” Now, after a transformation that might in more primitive times have been considered miraculous, the Church of England invites us in its new booklet, Daily Prayers for the Coronation of King Charles III, to celebrate Camilla’s “calling to a life of public service”. Church of Ireland liturgists beseech – or challenge – God, in another Camilla prayer, to “make her an example of virtue and godliness”. If this dismays Diana loyalists unable to forget the rottweiler years, Camilla’s acolytes could reasonably argue that a similar delay in St Augustine’s calling only added to his appeal. There may be hope, yet, for Prince Andrew. Whatever the final shape of the coronation, traditionalists who fear – as recently reported – that Charles wants some all-faithsy sort of variations on the old template, should surely take heart from the conviction, as testified by feats of prayer-composition alone, with which the Church of England has assumed ownership of the rite. (Not forgetting the king’s probable awareness that a more modest or ecumenical coronation would likely come at considerable cost in Camilla homage.) While the palace states, vaguely, that the ceremony “will reflect the monarch’s role today”, a letter from the archbishops of Canterbury and York reminds clergy that the ornate enthronement is a religious event: “through it we receive from Jesus”. Though, in a more easily observable transaction, it also receives from the king, in visibly enhanced status, while his mystical authority is, in return, supplied by the clergy in a style that might have verged on the obsequious at the Restoration. In today’s new coronation prayer we are invited to pray, for example, on behalf of “thy chosen servant Charles our King and Governor”, “that we and all his subjects (duly considering whose authority he hath) may faithfully serve honour and humbly obey him”. A prayer for journalists, in particular, to remember, next time they are denied information on whatever finances he hath concealed. Repeated arguments for a much edited or secular coronation, citing dwindling Christian belief as well as protagonists less obviously creditable than was Elizabeth in 1953, appear to have dented neither the church’s coronation ambitions nor the palace’s matching enthusiasm for spiritual choreography and knick-knacks. Only the Koh-i-noor has been sacrificed, to be sensitively replaced at the religious ceremony by the largest diamond in the world, the South African Cullinan. With decorative crosses over them, such jewels “remind us”, the prayerbook explains to the untutored, “that Jesus Christ is king over all”. A royal guide to the “sacred regalia” confidently ignores the possibility that the non-religious, now outnumbering Christians in England and Wales, might find its inventory of treasures, if not absurd, roughly as meaningful as museum labels speculating on the importance of some prehistoric grave-good. Which is not to say that I wouldn’t like my own eagle-shaped chrism-dispenser with convenient removable head; “the oil is poured through an aperture in the beak”. Non-believers must simply accept that, say, Camilla’s 3ft ivory rod with a dove “symbolic of the Holy Ghost” is too critical to national reverence to allow substitution with a replica more suited to the same nation’s acquired aversion to ivory. That this rod was brand-new on its introduction in 1685 merely underlines, to the devout, the still greater sacredness of an older spoon used in the anointing process. And that this year’s olive oil is literally from the Mount of Olives demonstrates, says the archbishop of Canterbury, “the deep historic link between the Coronation, the Bible and the Holy Land”. If these links fail to convince younger, more secular, more republican-minded subjects, they may not automatically impress older ones whose presumed pro-Charles tendencies are potentially offset by long memories. Anyone who can recall him, aged 32, smirking “Whatever ‘in love’ means” at the 19-year-old Diana, may think there are worthier objects of prayer. And when did the virtuous Camilla, famously lazy and still a sucker for £735-a-night wellness retreats, start reminding clerics of King Solomon? Or is the deep religious message of the coronation one that the last queen’s conduct helped for so long to obscure: that with heredity in charge, the Church of England is never safe from supreme governance by a future version of Prince Andrew? Either way, even given the accepted difficulties of picking spiritual leaders, it might have been wise for a church dedicated to the poor to invite fellow professionals to share the responsibility of anointing an irascible billionaire, however docile Charles might currently appear. No wonder some of the coronation prayers read like a cry for help. Day 27, “Self-control”: “As we remember the important tasks set before our King, and the challenges he will face, we pray that the fruit of self-control, which informs all our actions and decisions, will give him patience and strength…” Amen. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Chinese Communist party is poised to formally hand Xi another five years as party boss, and therefore leader of the country, at a summit that will also move his allies into key roles and elevate the status of his writings on power and government. The 20th Party Congress will – barring unprecedented last-minute drama – confirm him as the most powerful man in China since Mao Zedong, and probably enshrine him and his personal ideology in the party’s constitution. It is an uneasy precedent. After Mao’s death, China’s elite vowed never again to allow such concentration of power, and set up an unofficial system of collective leadership, term limits and a retirement age for high office. It facilitated smooth transfers of power – until Xi took over and swept those norms away. The son of a vice-premier, one of the “red princeling” descendants of the communist elite, his gilded early childhood was upended by his father’s fall from grace, then the violent upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. As he manoeuvred his way towards ultimate power, many in China and beyond hoped he had inherited some of his father’s relatively liberal outlook, and the scarring experiences of his early years might have inoculated him against totalitarianism. Instead, early chaos seems to have instilled an overwhelming desire for stability and control above all else, along with an unshakable conviction that he is the best man to deliver it for all China. Over 10 years as leader he has tightened his personal grip on the Communist party, and the party’s grip on the country. He has weeded out rivals and enemies through anti-corruption purges, and cracked down on grassroots dissent by tightening censorship and surveillance. Hong Kong, once a base for Beijing’s critics, has lost its democratic freedoms of speech and assembly, after Xi ended its semi-autonomous status. In Xinjiang on his watch, authorities have created a vast network of internment camps, with indefinite detention, torture and other abuses which the UN says may amount to “crimes against humanity”. This week is the moment when he will cement his control over all of China. More than 2,000 delegates to the meeting will represent nearly 100 million party members, and formally make decisions about personnel and plans for the next half decade. In reality they have been hand-picked to rubber-stamp Xi’s new term, and endorse an agenda and a new senior leadership team largely settled in months of behind-the-scenes wrangling. The government has locked down Beijing and rounded up dissidents to try to prevent the carefully choreographed meetings from being even slightly disrupted, although a lone protester did briefly manage to defy security controls, set a bridge ablaze and hang a protest banner. Even if the outcome is all but a foregone conclusion, the show of power, and pretence at unity, are politically vital to Xi and the party he controls. “You could say the congress is mainly theatre but it’s not theatre alone, and it’s terribly important,” said Holly Snape, an expert in Chinese politics at the University of Glasgow. “It involves a massive amount of coordinated control. “Even a powerful leader needs to garner ‘consensus’ (be it performed or genuine agreement) within the party. This is the moment when that ‘consensus’ – and therefore the ‘legitimacy’ of the leader inside the party – is confirmed and announced publicly.” The week will not only be an endorsement of Xi’s continued rule, it is also moment when he will lay out his vision for China’s future. A speech at the opening of the congress, and a “work report” presented at the end – officially covering all Communist party efforts for the last five years and plans for the next half decade – will give vital insight into where he hopes to take the country he now controls so tightly. Chinese elite politics is opaque and rare speeches like this offer a vital glimpse of where Xi hopes his country is headed. One of his themes in recent years has been the “great rejuvenation” of China. As part of that he is likely to offer further efforts on the environment, particularly for balanced rural development, an economic shift away from real-estate development, and technology advancement. It has also meant a more aggressive approach on the international stage, including abruptly ending Hong Kong’s form of limited autonomy, militarising the South China Sea and overtly threatening Taiwan. On the democratically ruled island, fears are rising that Beijing may be considering stepping back from a long-term commitment to “peaceful reunification”. “It is all but certain. Xi Jinping will serve three full terms at least,” said Victor Shih, professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego. “[Great rejuvenation] could be the main theme in the party congress which would of course have repercussions on the economy – China will have to keep growing and militarily it has to get stronger, it has to be an increasingly influential power in the world. So then one does wonder if there will be a change of wording with regards to Taiwan.” Xi’s step into the history books with a third term comes at a challenging time. While his personal position has steadily strengthened over the last 10 years, China’s fortunes have not followed such a clear upward trajectory. His consolidation of power came with a serious risk to already battered national finances, said Sung Wen-Ti, a political scientist at the Australian National University. “Another five-year term of Xi will likely mean greater state control of China’s hybrid economy, and China’s continuation of [a] ‘scorched earth’-like approach to maintaining zero-Covid for significantly longer than other countries,” Sung said. The economy has been already damaged by the global pandemic, and the international isolation caused by Xi’s personal commitment to keeping Covid out, even as other countries get used to living with the new disease. It has also been snarled up by bureaucratic over-reach of a party seeking to bolster control, and undermined by the weakening of ties with a world once far more broadly dependent on Chinese factories and products. Human rights concerns have spilled over into some supply chains, pushing companies to explore manufacturing elsewhere. Climate change is badly affecting China already. And an over-stretched real estate sector appears to be heading towards a crash. Beijing has made clear that centralisation and control will remain at the heart of policy in Xi’s “new era”, political concerns about Covid come ahead of economic growth, and Xi’s new policy team are unlikely to challenge him as much as the outgoing officials. “At this juncture, the most likely new economic and finance policy-makers are going to be Xi’s proteges and often Xi’s former secretaries,” Sung said. “They have relatively little independent power base outside of Xi’s patronage, and are therefore strongly incentivised to exhibit loyalty over independence, leading to a closed feedback-loop and a policy-making apparatus with weaker capacity for course-correction before disastrous policy consequences manifest.” China is likely to remain sealed off from the world at the very least until next summer when it is scheduled to host the Asian Games. Some opening up would be needed for them to go ahead, with zero-Covid rules likely to put off coaches and athletes. Analysts will be watching to see if Xi moves away from the language of past work reports, which promised to seek a peaceful resolution to the “Taiwan issue”. Leaving out the reference to seeking a peaceful past would be a clear signal that Xi is seriously considering bellicose options. “The vocabulary deployed in the official speeches will be an important weather gauge on how Xi has hardened his stance on Taiwan,” said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King’s College London. Bringing Taiwan back under Beijing’s control is “absolutely a personal matter” for the Chinese leader. Fujian province, where he spent the best part of two decades, lies just across the straits from Taiwan. There are business and personal links, and it is the physical frontline. “His political background meant that as a national leader he approached reunification with Taiwan with confidence. Today that confidence is a source of vulnerability as the prospect of peaceful reunification grows into question.” Despite pouring huge amounts of money into modernising China’s military, foreign analysts believe it is not yet capable, in technical or strategic terms, of seizing Taiwan by force. An amphibious landing on a well-protected island is among the most ambitious of military manoeuvres, that requires close coordination between air, land and sea assets. But Beijing is approaching the moment when it may be possible. Earlier this year, the deputy director of the CIA, David Cohen, said that while China’s leaders – particularly Xi – would prefer a bloodless route to control of Taipei, they want the military to be capable of seizing Taiwan by 2027. “It’s not good news if Xi can stay in power because he will definitely be more ambitious,” said Admiral Lee Hsi-Ming, the former head of the armed forces for Taiwan and its former deputy defence minister. “He has already asserted his power, he will have a stronger intention to achieve the so-called great Chinese rejuvenation.” Taiwan’s military and intelligence will not only be listening to Xi’s speech for clues about his plans for their island, but also parsing new appointments to the Central Military Commission. Lee said those appointees’ “backgrounds and attitudes towards Taiwan” could signal Xi’s plans. Recent Chinese military drills targeting Taiwan after a visit by US speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi were concerning. “They’re more assertive and confident about doing that kind of thing. Especially with some threats which we probably hadn’t focused on, like long range rocket systems … You can see they’re more confident about the political mission,” he added. Not everyone in the elite was happy about Xi’s hawkish stance on Taiwan, or absolutist approach to party control, but discontent was unlikely to spill over into the public eye this week, said Glasgow University’s Snape. “The party regards ‘party discipline’ as paramount. Rules prevent any public expression of dissent or disagreement; the cost of even being perceived or painted as breaking the rules is too high.” That doesn’t mean that Xi is guaranteed to rule for life if he wins another term, but his rise has left the party weaker. “One thing that is troubling inside the party is not just control on dissent, but the relative impoverishment of discussion,” Snape said. “There had been a real move towards greater policy debate and discussion inside the ruling elite, even if it remained an opaque process to those outside. Now toeing the line has become paramount.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/02/in-the-pacific-review-the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-warrior-boat-makes-for-thrilling-urgent-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-02T21:45:13Z","webTitle":"Murder in the Pacific review – the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior boat makes for thrilling, urgent TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/02/in-the-pacific-review-the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-warrior-boat-makes-for-thrilling-urgent-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/02/in-the-pacific-review-the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-warrior-boat-makes-for-thrilling-urgent-tv","fields":{"bodyText":"In 1985, the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace ship involved in protests against nuclear testing in the Pacific, sank when it was docked in Auckland, New Zealand. Police and even some crew members initially suspected that something had gone wrong with the boat, but it soon became clear that this was no accident. Over three parts, the gripping Murder in the Pacific tells the story of what happened that night, and what came next. “We’d never had a case like that,” says detective Chris Martin, who was 25 when he received the call to work on the investigation. Despite much of the story taking place almost 40 years ago, this tangled tale of nuclear weapons, geopolitical coverups and attempts to take action against impending environmental collapse is about as current as it is possible to get. With the Doomsday Clock moving closer to midnight, the idea of watching politicians argue that nuclear weapons act as a peacekeeping deterrent may be galling. But alongside the tragedy, both individual and on an international scale, this is a fascinating, pacy history with all the markings of a thriller. It begins by setting up the world of Greenpeace in the 80s and describing its anti-nuclear mission. Bunny McDiarmid was a deck hand who joined Greenpeace while travelling around the US in her 20s. She describes how boats each have a personality, right down to the smells. “She was a really lovely ship,” she remembers of the Rainbow Warrior. Peter Willcox was the skipper. “You couldn’t find a better boat to send a bunch of crazy hippies out on the ocean,” he recalls. Both describe the legacy of decades of nuclear testing in the Pacific, by the Americans and later the French. There is surely some deliberate ambiguity to the documentary title, which refers to the death of the photographer Fernando Pereira on the ship, but arguably to those gravely affected by radioactive contamination in the region, too. Willcox and McDiarmid discuss their role in moving islanders, whose ancestral land on the coral atoll of Rongelap was contaminated by nuclear fallout, to another atoll, after years of suffering from the effects of US nuclear testing. Greenpeace agreed to move, and publicise the plight of, 350 people, along with their housing. “That’s a huge operation,” says Willcox, with some understatement. Pereira was there to photograph it and tell the world what was going on. Director Chloe Campbell has marshalled many of the key players in this saga. As well as those on the Rainbow Warrior, and the police investigating the attack on the ship, there are politicians who present other layers to the story. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, then a Foreign Office minister, argues that Greenpeace’s action could have benefited the Kremlin, suggesting that there could have been a Soviet stooge involved, though he does not know who. Pierre Joxe, the French minister of the interior, argues that nuclear weapons are good for peace. (This feels like a less steady-handed assertion today, as the conflict in Ukraine grinds on.) Lord Heseltine, secretary of state for defence at the time, talks of the “essential” nature of nuclear deterrents back then, due to threats from the USSR. He says that while there was some agreement that Greenpeace had legitimate concerns, its tactics were less palatable to those in power. After Rongelap, these tactics went up another level. According to McDiarmid, the activists’ plan was to stop France testing in French Polynesia by turning themselves into a human shield. They would go into territorial waters, without permission, and get so close to the testing site that the French wouldn’t dare drop bombs, all the while taking photographs of what was going on. This was a military site, but the activists were optimistic, holding a party on the Rainbow Warrior, certain they were ready to “go out and change the world”. History had other ideas. On the night of the party, the ship was rocked by two explosions and Willcox describes watching from the dock as the boat sank, in 40 seconds. This is the first episode of three, and it races through the lead-up to the attack, and the immediate aftermath. It ends on a cliffhanger, which is quite a feat in a film about relatively recent history that many will remember. But this is a very well-made series that taps into historical fears as well as present-day ones, and whenever documentaries are made about eco-activists in an earlier time, you can’t help but feel despair at the fact that these people were ringing the alarm when we were a little less close to the point of no return.

That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior NATO official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. It would “almost certainly be drawing a physical response from many allies, and potentially from Nato itself,” the official said. The official added that Moscow was using its nuclear threats mainly to deter the alliance and other countries from directly entering its war on Ukraine. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday as Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. After 48 hours of Ukrainian cities coming under heavy fire, the government in Kyiv could celebrate positive news from both the frontlines and its diplomatic efforts to secure ground-to-air systems. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Kherson was the first city to fall to Russia following the invasion on 24 February and it is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s southern counterattack. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” Read the full story here: Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine, which includes ammunition, communications equipment, winter clothing, armoured vehicles and artillery. Some $15m (£9.8m) in winter clothing and $15.2m (£9.9m) in howitzer ammunition make up the bulk of the latest military assistance package, Anand announced as she sat down with her Nato counterparts in Brussels. Canada also will provide another $15.3m (£10m) worth of the high-tech cameras the Ukrainians have been using on their drones, along with more satellite communication services. More than 50 countries gathered for a meeting at Nato headquarters to promise more weapons, including air defences, for Ukraine after Russia launched its most intense missile strikes across the country since the war began. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, opened the gathering by condemning the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s, deadly missile attacks against “targets with no military purpose”. Sitting beside his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, Austin said: The whole world has just seen yet again the malice and cruelty of Putin’s war of choice, rooted in aggression and waged with deep contempt for the rules of war. But Russia’s latest assaults have only deepened the determination of the Ukrainian people and further united countries of goodwill from every region on Earth. More than 90,000 Russian fighters have been listed as “irrecoverable” military losses since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the Russian media project iStories. “Irrecoverable losses” is a category that includes servicemen who were killed, went missing, died from their wounds or were disabled and cannot return to military service. The figure is close to US and UK estimates. In August, Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said the Russian army’s total losses, including deaths, injuries, and desertions, exceeded 80,000. Here’s more from Gazprom’s chief, Alexei Miller, who has warned that “whole towns” in Europe could freeze this winter despite the continent having almost filled its gas storage facilities. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, Miller said: Winter can be relatively warm, but one week or even five days will be abnormally cold and it’s possible that whole towns and lands, god forbid, will freeze. During days of peak winter demand, Europe could lack some 800m cubic metres of natural gas per day, or one third of its total consumption, Miller said. European gas inventories are currently about 91% full, with the most pessimistic estimates suggesting they will be at 5% capacity in March, he added. US president Joe Biden has said he has not seen any movement from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the release of the American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, was sentenced to nine years in prison in August after Russian police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow in February. On Monday, Griner’s defence team appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking. The US has said she was wrongfully detained and has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in America. Asked if he had seen any action on Griner’s case, Biden replied: Not from Putin. During his interview with CNN on Tuesday, Biden said he would be willing to meet Putin at the G20 meeting next month if the Russian leader wanted to discuss the detained WNBA star. He said: I have no intention of meeting with him. But for example, if he came to me at the G20 and said I want to talk about the release of Griner, I’d meet with him. I mean, it would depend. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has tweeted a photo of himself returning to Kyiv after meeting with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday. At Tuesday’s meeting shown on Russian state television, Putin told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “of concern”. The Russian leader also told Grossi that Moscow was open for dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the facility’s operations. Russian authorities are mobilising men from the country’s most vulnerable groups to fight in Ukraine, according to a report. Officials in Moscow have taken men from charity centres for the homeless and needy, as well as hostels where labour migrants live, the Moscow Times has cited a report by the independent Mediazona news website. Dozens of homeless men have been taken off the streets and brought to military enlistment offices in the weeks since President Vladimir Putin declared a “partial” mobilisation, according to a group that hands out food to the capital’s homeless community. One source told Mediazona: The police come here without anyone asking. They see a queue of people waiting for food — and then they grab them by the scruff of the neck, against their will. The men are then loaded onto buses and transported to military enlistment offices, the source said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. In a statement, Shmyhal said: We are grateful to all Ukrainians who deliberately reduced electricity consumption yesterday and the night before yesterday. The total saving was 10%. We also thank the heads of regions, heads of communities, who took a responsible approach and cut power consumption in communities. He also appealed to people to use gas and coal sparingly after turning on the heating: The minimum permissible indoor temperature this winter will be 16 degrees Celsius, while the average temperature will be 18 degrees. This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP, has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. The Vatican’s number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said the bombing of unarmed civilians “is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned”. President Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. President Joe Biden has said he believes Vladimir Putin is a “rational actor” who badly misjudged his prospects of occupying Ukraine. The US president told CNN on Tuesday that he believed his Russian counterpart had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion, but does not believe he would resort to using a tactical nuclear weapon. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has also denied the report. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior Nato official. Reuters quotes the official as saying that Moscow’s industry cannot produce all kinds of ammunition and weapon systems due to western sanctions. President Vladimir Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Speaking to reporters, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said: Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdoğan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstan’s capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has previously said the potential talks between Russia and the west could be discussed during the meeting. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Reuters reports the the defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament: “These attacks ... can only be met with unrelenting support for Ukraine and its people.” Earlier we reported that Pope Francis had condemned the recent wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities, saying: “My heart is always with the Ukrainian people, especially the residents of the places that have been hit by relentless bombings. May the Lord’s spirit transform the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that the hurricane of violence stops and peaceful coexistence in justice can be rebuilt.” Reuters has now reported an additional quote from the Vatican number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Asked if the attacks could be considered war crimes, he said he was not qualified to make such a technical, juridical judgment. “But certainly they are unacceptable acts that cry out vengeance before God and before humanity, because bombing unarmed civilians is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned,” Parolin said. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the aftermath of Russian attacks on central Kyiv earlier this week. Power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is surrounded by Russian troops, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi, director general of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, had warned earlier today that the nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, had lost all external power needed for vital safety systems for the second time in five days. Grossi has now tweeted that he has been informed by his team that the external power to the facility has been restored: Earlier today, Grossi, who met yesterday with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said IAEA monitors at the Zaporizhzhia plant reported the interruption in external power, and said backup diesel generators were keeping nuclear safety and security equipment operational. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas, saying there is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow, Alexei Miller said gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months. Miller also said repairs to the damaged Nord Stream pipelines would take at least a year, and that Russia had still not been granted access to the area of damage. Germany and the EU “should respond” if they are interested in restoring the pipeline, he said. Simon Smith, a former British ambassador to Ukraine, writes for us today about how Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days stem from Vladimir Putin’s desperation. In their vicious efforts to extinguish Ukraine, the Russians have reached an unprecedented state of weakness and cluelessness, he writes. Putin is signalling that he is paying no heed to any waning commitment to the war among the population at large, following his mobilisation decision. And that he’s listening more closely to those who have been vocally critical of the army’s poor performance, and who have called for a tougher, (even) more ruthless offensive approach. But it goes further than that. It’s also an intimidatory message to Russian citizens opposed to his needless war – or even those simply less convinced of its good sense or justice. Read the full piece here: Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the west to officially recognise Russia’s aggression and acts in Ukraine as genocide. Russian forces have committed attacks on civilian infrastructure, mass executions and rape, forced deportations, separated families and destroyed Ukrainian literature in schools, Podolyak said on Twitter. Here’s more from President Vladimir Putin’s address to the Russian Energy Week international forum earlier today, where he proposed that Moscow could redirect gas supplies for the Nord Stream pipelines to the Black Sea to create a major European gas hub in Turkey. Putin said it was possible to repair the damaged pipelines but that Russia and Europe should decide their fate. He said: We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey. He added: That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course. The Kremlin has denied a report that Elon Musk spoke with President Vladimir Putin before publishing his “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer said the Tesla CEO had told him that Putin was “prepared to negotiate”. Musk has since denied the report. Asked if Musk had spoken to Putin prior to publishing the Twitter poll, the Kremlin’s spokesperson said: No, this is not true. The pair had communicated over the phone “about a year and a half ago”, Peskov added without providing any details. In a reply to a tweet, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader “only once and that was about 18 months ago”. The subject matter of that conversation was “space”, he added. Bremmer subsequently reiterated his initial claims, and said Musk had told him he had spoken with Putin “directly about Ukraine”. We reported yesterday that children’s doctor Oksana Leontieva was among those killed by Russian missile strikes on Kyiv earlier this week. Leontieva was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. Now her father, Gregory, has told German newspaper Bild that her death has left her five-year-old son an orphan after his father recently died as well. He added: Oksana had called the hospital in the morning because the kindergarten couldn’t take her son due to warnings of a possible attack. In the end, they did take Grischa ... and she went to work. Gregory said the boy had not yet been told his mother had died. Gregory said: For now he thinks she is at work and working very hard. We will tell him today or tomorrow. The doctor’s funeral is due to be held later this week. The number of people wounded after a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region has risen to nine, according to a city official. At least seven people were killed after the Russian shelling on the market this morning, Vitalii Barabash, the head of the Avdiivka city military administration, said. In a statement on Telegram, Barabash said: Today is another black day for our Avdiivka. In the morning, the Russian evil spirits once again brought death to our land, sneakily, as always, shelling the central market with tanks and MLR systems during rush hour. Seven residents of Avdiivka were killed and nine were wounded. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The financial aid would most likely be in the form of cheap loans with long repayment deadlines. But it would require EU member states to find extra money to guarantee the loans and potentially pay the interest. According to the World Bank, Ukraine’s economy is on course to shrink by more than one third (35%) in 2022, as a result of the widespread destruction of factories, infrastructure, fertile land, as well as the displacement of 14 million people. EU sources fear that if Ukraine cannot afford to pay its bills it could print money, triggering inflation. EU officials are optimistic about an agreement on the new financial aid, despite long delays in releasing €9bn funding for Ukraine promised in May. Nearly five months since the commission proposed €9bn in “macro financial assistance” for Ukraine, only €1bn has been released. Earlier this month, Brussels and Kyiv signed an agreement on the next €5bn, paving the way for a €2bn tranche to be released this month. EU member states have been wrangling over whether aid to Ukraine should be offered as non-repayable grants, as favoured by Germany, or cheap loans, the option backed by most member states. The money would allow the Ukrainian government to pay salaries, fund humanitarian relief and make emergency repairs to some essential infrastructure. But it falls far short of the vast costs of rebuilding Ukraine, estimated by the World Bank to be $349bn (€359bn, £315bn). President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational, in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The Russian leader said gas could still be supplied by one remaining intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, he said. Putin says: Russia is ready to start such supplies. The ball is in the court of the EU. If they want, they can just open the tap. He went on to say that Russia has nothing to do with the sky-high energy prices that Europeans are facing this winter, instead blaming the west for stoking a global energy crisis. It was the poorest countries that would pay the highest price in terms of rising energy costs, Putin added. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is currently addressing the Russian Energy Week international forum’s plenary session. Large leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines running from Russia to Europe were an “act of international terrorism” that set a “dangerous precedent”. Putin says: There is no doubt it was an act of international terrorism, aiming to undermine the energy security of a whole continent. The calculation behind it was quite cynical, to block and destroy the cheap energy sources and deprive millions of people and industrial consumers of gas, heat, power and other resources. The “attack” against the Nord Stream pipelines was a “most dangerous precedent”, he continued: It shows that any piece of critical transport energy or communications infrastructure is at risk now. Putin goes on to blame Ukrainian special services for what he calls the “terrorist attack” against the Kerch bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region said. In a statement, Pavlo Kyrylenko said: The Russians struck the central market where many people were at that time. He added: There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others. More to follow. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The statement reads: At the end of August, the little ones were forcibly taken out of Kharkiv region to the Russian township of Kabardinka (near Gelendzhik), despite the fact that everyone has parents. The families had been reunited, it said. The ministry described the return process as difficult but successful. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Further munitions would be secured over the coming days, said Serhiy Prytula, who organised the initiative. He said: “They wanted to scare us but we united even more. Remember: never infuriate Ukrainians. Never. The people have donated for the revenge, so we will ensure the revenge happens.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told G7 leaders on Tuesday via video conference that Russia had used a variety of munitions to strike Ukrainian cities over the previous two days, killing 20 people. “The enemy has used more than 100 cruise missiles, dozens of different drones, including Iranian Shaheds,” he said. “And every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” Read the full story here: The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, Peskov said: We express our daily regret that Western heads of state – the US as well as European – engage in nuclear rhetoric every day. We consider this a pernicious and provocative practice. Russia does not want to take part in these exercises and does not take part in them. Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) countries yesterday warned of “severe consequences” if Russia decided to use nuclear weapons, in a statement after a call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The US president, Joe Biden, warned that threats from Russia could result in catastrophic “mistakes” and “miscalculation”, a week after he said the risk of “nuclear Armageddon” was at its highest level in 60 years. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin also denied reports from some regional officials that they were stepping up mobilisation efforts. “There is no new wave,” Peskov said, telling reporters to check with individual governors to see what they meant. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 on Tuesday condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. That is it from me Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Russia’s security forces have released what they claim is an X-ray image of the cargo that caused the explosion at the weekend on the Crimea bridge. The veracity of the image, and its source, has not been independently verified. It has been issued as part of their investigation which has led to the arrest of eight individuals today [see 7.13am]. Russia has claimed the plan was masterminded by Ukrainian officials, a suggestion which has been dismissed as “nonsense” by Ukraine’s interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov [see 9.08am]. Russia’s Dmitry Peskov has said that comments made by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg could be considered confirmation that Nato is fighting on Ukraine’s side in Kyiv’s conflict with Russia. Reuters remind us that yesterday Stoltenberg said that a Russian victory in Ukraine would be “a defeat for us all” During his regular morning media briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson also said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was harmful and provocative. “We express our daily regret that western heads of state engage in nuclear rhetoric every day,” Peskov said, adding that such a practice was “provocative”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators. It has been cut off from off-site power. In a statement posted to Telegram, Energoatom said: This morning, 12 October at 8.59am, as a result of rocket fire by Russian troops, the Dniprovska substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region was damaged. As a result, the 750-kV communication line of ZANP – Dniprovska was accidentally opened. As a result, the ZNPP was completely de-energized. Diesel generators turned on automatically. Energoatom prepared and sent another batch of diesel fuel to the ZNPP. However, as of 10am, the Russian side does not allow the company’s convoy of vehicles to pass. Russian shelling and damage to energy infrastructure related to the operation of nuclear power plants is the same manifestation of nuclear terrorism as direct shelling of the ZNPP, and leads to the same consequences and threats of a radiation accident. The occupiers continue to neglect the nuclear and radiation safety of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, threatening the world with a radiation disaster. The claims have not been independently verified. Both sides have previously accused the other of shelling the ZNPP directly, which sits in one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing.” The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. A senior Ukrainian official dismissed as “nonsense” on Wednesday Russia’s investigation into an explosion last weekend that badly damaged a bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has blamed Ukraine’s security forces for the explosion, and earlier today Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the blast. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited the interior minister spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, as saying when asked about Moscow’s allegations on the Crimea Bridge blast. Reuters reports Yusov described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. RIA Novosti, the Russian state-owned news agency, has a breaking news story quoting Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed leader of occupied Zaporizhzhia, saying that a nuclear safety zone cannot be established around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “until the frontline is pushed at least 100km, otherwise it is unsafe”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power, as “deeply worrying”. Rafael Grossi tweeted: Our team at the ZNPP informed me this morning that the plant has lost all of its external power for the second time in five days. Its back-up diesel generators are now providing electricity for its nuclear safety and security functions. This repeated loss of the ZNPP’s off-site power is a deeply worrying development and it underlines the urgent need for a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the site. The ZNPP has been occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff since early in Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Russia has claimed to have “annexed” Zaporizhzhia, and stated it intends to take the plant under its own operational framework. You can understand there being jitters about Europe’s power infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipeline incident, but Poland’s top official in charge of energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, has told Reuters by telephone that there are no grounds to believe the leak in the Polish section of the Druzhba oil pipeline was caused by sabotage. “Here we can talk about accidental damage,” he said. Reuters is carrying a report, citing the Russian Interfax news agency, that Russia’s Transneft state-owned pipeline monopoly said on Wednesday it had received notice from Polish operator Pern about a leak on the Druzhba oil pipeline. Transneft stated that oil continues to be pumped towards Poland, and that Pern had not yet said how long repairs would take. The pipeline was built by the Soviet Union in the 1960s to pump oil from eastern regions of Russia into the satellite states of the Soviet bloc, and it now carries oil to points in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to Telegram to say that “the night was quiet” in his region, but that in the morning Russians resumed shelling at the border. As of 10am local time he had no information on casualties. Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko has been interviewed from Strasbourg by Sky News in the UK, and has said that delays in delivering assistance to Ukraine were “incredibly frustrating”, and that she felt little comfort from suggestions that there were no signs Russia was about to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine. She told viewers: I know that sometimes, some western countries, they’re just far and they don’t feel the urgency, which is incredibly frustrating for us. Because you know, we don’t have time for discussion. So we are screaming, we are trying to to do everything possible to defend with our weapons, our people, every second. Asked about the head of British GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, talking down the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, she said: I don’t think it can offer me a comfort, because the threat of nuclear war is very, very high. We understand that Putin doesn’t have any logic anymore. It’s not possible to justify Putin anymore. We understand that he is in the final battle of his life, where he wants to prove to all the world that he can do whatever he wants, including taking lands, killing thousands of people, destroying infrastructure, and we understand that nuclear threats and a strike is very possible. Yesterday Fleming said “I would hope that we would see indicators if they started to go down that path,” and suggested that “The way in which the Russian military machine and President Putin are conducting this war, they are staying within the doctrine that we understand for their use, including for nuclear weapons.” Here is a video clip from Joe Biden’s CNN TV interview, where he says that he believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had underestimated the ferocity of Ukrainian defiance in the face of invasion. ‘I think … he thought he was going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was the home of Mother Russia in Kyiv, and that he was going to be welcomed, and I think he just totally miscalculated,’ Biden said. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some more details of the plot to damage the Crimea bridge which Russian security forces claim to have revealed today. It reports: In early August, the cargo was sent from the seaport of Odesa to the Bulgarian Ruse [port] … From Bulgaria it proceeded to the Georgian port of Poti , and then to Armenia. From 29 September to 3 October, at the Transalliance terminal in Yerevan, the cargo was cleared … On a DAF truck registered in Georgia, the cargo crossed the Russian-Georgian border on 4 October at the Upper Lars checkpoint, two days later it was delivered and unloaded at a wholesale base in Armavir. On 7 October … the documents for the cargo were again changed. TEK-34 LLC from Ulyanovsk was indicated as the sender , and a non-existent company in the Crimea was indicated as the recipient. The movement of cargo along the entire route was controlled by an employee of the main intelligence directorate of the ministry of defence of Ukraine, who introduced himself to the participants in the scheme as “Ivan Ivanovich”. To coordinate actions, he used a virtual anonymous number, as well as a phone registered to a resident of Kremenchug. RIA reminds us that the explosion occurred on 8 October, and that the official account is “a truck exploded on the Crimean bridge after which seven tanks with fuel of a passing train caught fire. Two car spans partially collapsed, but the bridge arch supports were not damaged. Four people were killed, including a judge from Moscow.” Polish pipeline operator Pern detected a leak on Tuesday evening in one line of the Druzhba pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, it said on Wednesday. Pern said at this point the causes of the leak are unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70km from the central Polish city of Plock. The second line of the pipeline, and other elements of Pern’s infrastructure, were working as normal, Pern said. “At this point, all Pern services (technical, operational, in-house fire brigade and environmental protection) are taking action in accordance with the algorithms provided for this type of situation,” Reuters reports the operator said. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has claimed that five people were injured and 17 houses were damaged by fire from Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours. Donetsk is one of the occupied regions that Russia has claimed to annex. The Donetsk People’s Republic was declared in 2014, and Russia, Syria and North Korea are the only UN member states to recognise it as a legitimate authority. The claims have not been independently verified. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update on Telegram on Ukraine’s military progress in the occupied Luhansk region. He writes: The armed forces of Ukraine are moving forward little by little. The Russians are shelling our positions mainly with rocket and barrel artillery. The occupiers are building a multi-layer defence line in Luhansk region, the entire first section of the front line is mined by them. Our military has already encountered the first wave of partially mobilised Russians. Luhansk is one of the region of occupied Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex following a widely-derided “referendum”. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them, according to reports from the state-owned Tass news agency. It quotes a statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) saying: The Federal Security Service, together with the Investigative Committee, established that the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case. The FSB claims that the explosives which caused a section of the bridge to collapse were sent from Odessa through Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia. Tass reports that the cargo carrying the explosives was being sent to a non-existent company in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Most have reportedly been refused entry. There has been an exodus of conscription-age men from Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation on 21 September, but most fled by road, rail and air to Europe, and neighbouring former Soviet Union countries, like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. On Tuesday, South Korean broadcaster KBS reported that at least 21 Russians had arrived aboard yachts at ports in the south of the country, but only two had been granted entry, while others were refused as authorities deemed their purpose “ambiguous”. KBS reported that three yachts had docked in the southeastern port city of Pohang over the past several days, mostly carrying Russian men in their 20-30s. An official at Pohang’s coast guard declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A justice ministry official said he did not have details about the yacht cases, but Russians are in general allowed to enter the country without a visa as long as they obtain prior approval via South Korea’s electronic travel authorisation system. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its latest update on the situation in Ukraine, in which it reports that 60% of the “Shahed” drones launched by Russia on 10 October were destroyed in the air. The drones are manufactured in Iran. “These UAVs are slow and fly at low altitudes making lone aircraft easy to target using conventional air defences. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has achieved some success by attacking with several UAVs at the same time,” according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bangkok next month, according to a report in the Bangkok Post, which cites an unnamed security source. Both the G20 and Apec summits will be held in Southeast Asia in November, with gatherings overshadowed by the war in Ukraine. Ministerial meetings held over the past year have been marred by confrontation and walkouts. Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden are reportedly expected to attend the G20 summit in Bali between 15 and 15th November, while Indonesia has also invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to attend. Apec will be held on 18 and 19 November. On Tuesday, Lavrov said that Putin would not turn down a meeting with Biden in Bali. Talking on Russian state TV, he said that Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. “This is a lie”, he added. Biden is not expected to be at Apec and will instead return home to attend his granddaughter’s wedding ceremony, according to Thai media. It is not known whether Xi will attend Apec. Would Lukashenko really throw Belarus into a war Russia is losing? Andrew Roth and Daniel Boffey tackle the question in a new analysis piece. Alexander Lukashenko, the dictatorial leader of Belarus, has executed a careful balancing act during the war in Ukraine. On 24 February, Russian troops that had massed on Belarusian territory surged across the border into Ukraine, using his country as a staging ground in the largest invasion in Europe since the second world war. But the Belarusian leader has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times saying that he felt the invasion was “dragging on”. Now, meetings between Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin have once again raised fears he is about to enter the fray. Lukashenko has said that Belarus and Russia are to deploy a joint military group and that thousands of Russian troops will be arriving in his country in the coming days for drills. “We emphasise once again that the tasks of the regional force group are purely defensive. And all activities carried out at the moment are aimed at providing a sufficient response to actions near our borders,” the Belarusian defence minister, Viktor Khrenin, said in a statement on Tuesday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sounded the alarm during a meeting of the G7 on Tuesday, proposing to send UN peacekeepers to the border between Ukraine and Belarus to prevent Lukashenko from launching a “provocation”. Despite the warning signs, there is considerable doubt that Lukashenko is ready to throw his own forces into a war that Russia is losing in Ukraine, even if he is under pressure from Putin. Energy exports appear to be helping Russia ride out Western sanctions, AFP reports. Moscow says inflation is easing and employment is virtually full, contradicting the predictions of a catastrophe from many financial experts. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday offered some support to Russia’s view, saying recession will be less severe than expected due to oil exports and relatively stable domestic demand. The IMF forecast the Russian economy to contract just 3.4% over the whole year, after contracting 21.8% during the second quarter at a quarterly annualised rate. It was only in June that the IMF forecast an annual drop of 6%. When US President Joe Biden was asked in a Tuesday evening interview on CNN whether he thinks Putin will use nuclear weapons, he said, “I don’t think he will.” Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. “The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome,” he told Tapper. “And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war or anything, but just once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the miscalculations, who knows what would happen.” Russian troops have sustained equipment and personnel losses in Ukraine’s south, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing Ukraine’s Operational Command. “Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that they completed over 300 fire missions, targeting and damaging two Russian Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers and an APC,” the Kyiv Independent said in a tweet. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest developments for the next while. Russian troops have sustained losses in Ukraine’s south following 300 fire missions, Ukraine’s Operational Command reported overnight. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN on Tuesday evening, US President Joe Biden said he doesn’t think Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon. Biden was speaking after warning last week that the world faced the most acute nuclear threat for 60 years –since the Cuban missile crisis. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments in the conflict: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described Russia’s attacks as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. During Russia’s strikes in recent days, cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday they exhumed the bodies of dozens of people, including civilians and a one-year-old baby, to determine the cause of death after the retreat of Russian troops from Lyman and Sviatohirsk, two recently liberated towns in the eastern Donetsk region. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. The Kremlin has confirmed that Putin will meet Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between Putin and Biden at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile the deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Valeriy Martynyuk was taken on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. Russian strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites, Zelenskiy said as he urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/xi-jinping-poised-to-further-consolidate-power-at-party-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T11:28:29Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping poised to further consolidate power at party congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/xi-jinping-poised-to-further-consolidate-power-at-party-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/xi-jinping-poised-to-further-consolidate-power-at-party-congress","fields":{"bodyText":"The announcement of a Communist party meeting that is expected to cement Xi Jinping’s agenda for the coming years shows the strength of Xi’s “ultimate authority”, analysts have said. The CCP’s twice-a-decade meeting will begin on 16 October and is likely to run for several days. Xi, considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, is expected to further consolidate his political power, which he has wielded with increasing authoritarianism since taking charge of the party in late 2012. Recent domestic and global challenges had prompted some doubts among observers but Xi is expected to maintain power for some years to come after he abolished the two-term presidential limit in 2018. The meeting will bring together more than 2,000 party members in a process of selecting new officials for the elite 200-member central committee. Some will be promoted to the 25-member politburo, and some to the powerful seven-member standing committee. The event will also announce future policy directions. Very little detail has been released, but analysts have said the date – roughly in line with when previous meetings have been held – suggests that any in-party disputes have been reined in, and the new committee members are likely to have been finalised. Dr Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at Chatham House, an international affairs thinktank in London, said the announcement was a “sure sign of strength [of Xi’s] ultimate authority within the party”. She said it was a sign Xi had “managed to conclude an agreement with other senior colleagues within the party on key personnel appointments as well as a nearly final approval of the draft political report, which will be read by him on 16 October. “It also means if there were disagreements on China’s domestic economic planning or on diplomacy, those differences have been reconciled.” The meeting will be watched closely by Chinese politics analysts at home and abroad. Ryan Manuel, founder of Bilby, an AI research company specialising in predicting Chinese regulations, said: “The past has been decided, so to speak, and the next five years is mostly determined in terms of positions of the top party leaders.” He likened the process to a multinational company announcing a mass of senior retirements and the elevation of junior employees to replace them, but with the reshuffle of job titles held off until the annual National People’s Congress (NPC) in March 2023. Many of those departing from the central committee will be retiring under age limit policies. In recent decades there has been a tacit understanding within the party that only leaders aged 67 or younger can be promoted to or remain in top posts, while those 68 or older at the time of the next congress must retire. In China it is commonly called qi shang ba xia (“seven up, eight down”). Xi, 69, is not retiring. Other members have retired, died or been “purged” from the party by Xi’s controversial anti-corruption drives. Xi centralised political power around himself during his first two terms, including through military restructures, and there was a deepening official reverence for his leadership, according to analysts. Analysts expect Xi to retain two of his three titles at the meeting: general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the central military commission. He will hang on to the title of president until the NPC next year, when he is expected to be formally reappointed to that role. “The five-year term is important because, first, it provides renewed legitimation for the collective central party leadership as a whole,” said Dr Ling Li, an expert in Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna. “Meanwhile, it facilitates a regenerative mechanism to replace ageing leaders with younger ones and prevents the party to fall in gerontocracy.” Crackdowns on dissent and increasing control over Chinese society mean there is little public challenge to Xi. The CCP has made concerted efforts to maintain stability in the lead-up to the meeting but it has faced challenges including a faltering economy worsened by a housing market crisis, a population chafing at continued zero-Covid policies, environmental disasters, and disputes with the west and its allies, most notably over Taiwan. At home, Xi has claimed his party has eradicated extreme poverty in his goal for “common prosperity”, and has made major climate crisis commitments. Manuel said Xi had a “big focus on rural rejuvenation” as well as green policy. “He needs to solve issues of water and soil, which is harder than issues of air pollution, and he did very well on that,” he said. “The next challenge is tough: he needs to deal with a faltering economy and zero Covid. Part of the way to do that is rebalance towards more green growth, to shift away from real estate development. There’s going to need to be a new [economic] model to put forward.” On the international front, Beijing has grown increasingly isolated from the west under Xi. Relations with the US and its allies are at historic lows. China largely closed itself off during the pandemic and vociferously pushed back against accusations that it was responsible for the outbreak. Early this year, Xi’s “no limits” partnership with Vladimir Putin sparked further alarm. Under Xi’s rule, Beijing has continued its expansionist activities in the South China Sea and, most visibly, increased pressure and military intimidation on Taiwan, which it sees as its own and has vowed to retake by force if necessary. Xi has not left China since the pandemic began in 2020, but there are widespread reports of plans to attend bilateral or multilateral meetings after the congress, including the G20 in Indonesia in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/23/cargo-ships-powered-by-wind-could-help-tackle-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Cargo ships powered by wind could help tackle climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/23/cargo-ships-powered-by-wind-could-help-tackle-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/23/cargo-ships-powered-by-wind-could-help-tackle-climate-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"Cars, trucks and planes get plenty of blame for helping drive the climate crisis, but shipping produces a significant portion of the world’s greenhouse gases, as well as nitrogen oxides and sulphur pollution because ships largely use cheap heavy fuel oil. It’s been a struggle to clean up the shipping industry but one solution is to use wind-powered ships. That may seem like going back to the days of the Cutty Sark, but new hi-tech wind-propulsion can be fitted to existing ships to cut fuel use, supplying between 10% and 90% of a ship’s power needs, depending on where on the ocean they are and which weather patterns they harness. Wind is free, blows harder at sea than on land and weather-routing software uses sophisticated algorithms to plot the fastest and most fuel-efficient voyage. A wide range of wind-powered devices for ships have been designed, using sails, kites or rotors that look like vertical cylinders. These are mounted on a ship’s deck and many can be retrofitted to existing vessels. Already more than 20 commercial cargo ships use wind power to cut their fuel use, and more are being launched, but it is taking a long time for wind power to become widely accepted in the industry. • The text and subheading of this article were amended on 2 April 2023.

Conservative party members, of course. Who are they? Disproportionately rich, white, older men living in the south of England. But there are some members whose profile we have no means of knowing. They don’t live in the UK, have never been residents or citizens here and have no right to vote in our elections. Astonishingly, since 2018 these foreign members have been permitted to determine who the UK prime minister should be. The Conservative party’s rules of association are an open invitation to anyone who wants to mess with our politics. There seems to be nothing to stop agents of another government from registering as members with Conservatives Abroad. Nor, it seems, is there anything to stop one person (or one botswarm) applying for multiple memberships. So much for the party of patriotism, sovereignty and national security. This open invitation, to judge from the little information we can glean, has yet to be fully exploited. Perhaps foreign governments haven’t yet realised what a golden opportunity they’ve been given. Perhaps they simply can’t believe how irresponsible the Tories are. But we don’t need to suggest a campaign by another state to see Truss as a kind of Manchurian Candidate, subverting what remains of our democracy on behalf of undemocratic interests. As a rule, the more loudly a politician proclaims their patriotism, the more likely they are to act on behalf of foreign money. Every recent Conservative prime minister has placed the interests of transnational capital above the interests of the nation. But, to a greater extent than any previous leader, Truss’s politics have been shaped by organisations that call themselves thinktanks, but would be better described as lobbyists who refuse to reveal who funds them. Now she has brought them into the heart of government. Her senior special adviser, Ruth Porter, was communications director at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), an extreme neoliberal lobby group. An investigation by the democracy campaign Transparify listed the IEA as “highly opaque” about its funding sources. We know from a combination of leaks and US filings that it has a history of taking money from tobacco companies and since 1967 from the oil company BP, and has also received large disbursements from foundations funded by US billionaires, some of which have been among the major sponsors of climate science denial. When she worked at the IEA, Porter called for reducing housing benefit and child benefit, charging patients to use the NHS, cutting overseas aid and scrapping green funds. She then became head of economic and social policy at Policy Exchange, which was also listed by Transparify as “highly opaque”. Policy Exchange is the group that (after Porter left) called for a new law against Extinction Rebellion, which became, in former home secretary Priti Patel’s hands, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. We later discovered it had received $30,000 from the US oil company Exxon. Liz Truss, according to the head of the IEA, has spoken at more of its events than “any other politician over the past 12 years”. Two of Truss’s meetings with the organisation were deleted from the official record, then reinstated after the deletions caused a scandal. More importantly, Truss was the ostensible founder, in 2011, of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs. The group’s webpage was registered by Ruth Porter, who at the time worked for the IEA. The IEA organised events for the group and supplied it with media briefings. Twelve members of the current cabinet, including several of its most senior figures, belonged to the group. Today, if you try to open its webpage, you are redirected to the Free Market Forum, which calls itself “a project of the Institute of Economic Affairs”. Truss’s chief economic adviser is Matthew Sinclair, formerly chief executive of a similar lobbying group, the Taxpayers’ Alliance. It is also funded obscurely by foreign donors. Sinclair wrote a book called Let Them Eat Carbon, arguing against action to prevent climate breakdown. It claimed that: “Equatorial regions might suffer, but it is entirely possible that this will be balanced out by areas like Greenland.” In other words, we can trade the lives of billions of people against the prospects of some of the least inhabited places on Earth. It’s among the most callous and ignorant statements I’ve ever seen. Truss’s interim press secretary, Alex Wild, was research director at the same organisation. Her health adviser, Caroline Elsom, was senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies, which was listed by Transparify as – you guessed it – “highly opaque”. Her political secretary, Sophie Jarvis, was head of government affairs at the Adam Smith Institute (also “highly opaque”), and funded, among others, by tobacco companies and US foundations. These groups represent the extreme fringe of neoliberalism. This maintains that human relationships are entirely transactional: we’re motivated above all by the pursuit of money, which shapes our behaviour. Yet, hilariously, when you challenge them about their funding, they deny that the money they receive influences the positions they take. For decades, policy development on the right was shaped as follows. Oligarchs and corporations funded the thinktanks. The thinktanks proposed policies that, by sheer coincidence, suited the interests of oligarchs and corporations. The billionaire press – also owned by oligarchs – reported these policy proposals as brilliant insights by independent organisations. Conservative frontbenchers then cited the press coverage as evidence of public demand: the voice of the oligarchs was treated as the voice of the people. In his autobiography Think Tank, Madsen Pirie, founder of the Adam Smith Institute, explained how it worked. Every Saturday, in a wine bar in Leicester Square, staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs would sit down with Conservative researchers and leader writers and columnists from the Times and Telegraph to plan “strategy for the week ahead” and “co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively”. The Daily Mail weighed in to help the lobbyists refine their arguments and ensure there was a supportive article on its leader page every time they published a report. But now the thinktanks don’t need a roundabout route. They are no longer lobbying government. They are the government. Liz Truss is their candidate. To defend the interests of global capital, she will wage war against any common endeavour to improve our lives or protect the living planet. If Labour is looking for a three-word slogan with which to fight the next election, it could do worse than “Mend This Country”.

Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday It feels impossible. The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising. However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here. The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates. So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems. “What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.” Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy – burning wood or crops for electricity. It’s no wonder that the UK’s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind. After wind and solar, the biggest prize is stopping the destruction of forests and other wild places, the IPCC scientists found. That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne – half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today. Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer – 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 – as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes. There are some interesting details too. A shift to “sustainable diets” – ie eating much less red meat in rich nations – could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option – burying charcoal in fields (biochar) – is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year. The IPCC chart is a map of climate optimism. It shows we can cut emissions by half by 2030 with options costing at most $100 per tonne, which is a bargain when set against the further damages that climate inaction will inevitably bring. The solutions – wind, solar, trees, energy saving and methane cuts – require no new technology. But what they do require is a resource heavily lacking so far: the political will to push aside vested interests and rapidly pursue the policies that will work. “The chart is a very useful hitlist,” says Blok. “I think every country can take it and see in which areas they could do more. If we don’t achieve [a 50% cut in emissions by 2030], it will not be because of a lack of options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/oct/27/lpo-manze-review-vaughan-williams-royal-festival-hall","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T15:43:01Z","webTitle":"LPO/Manze review – Vaughan Williams’s beauty, and disturbing power, to the fore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/27/lpo-manze-review-vaughan-williams-royal-festival-hall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/oct/27/lpo-manze-review-vaughan-williams-royal-festival-hall","fields":{"bodyText":"The London Philharmonic is marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of Ralph Vaughan Williams in three concerts this autumn. Andrew Manze conducted the first of them, allowing a London audience a sample of the outstanding VW performances he has been producing in recent seasons both in concert and on disc with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. The main work here was the Ninth Symphony, but there was also space for two very well known works, the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis and The Lark Ascending. The antiseptic acoustic of the Festival Hall is hardly ideal for the Tallis Fantasia, whose carefully terraced textures were conceived for the warm expanses of Gloucester Cathedral. But with all three string choirs – quartet, ensemble and orchestral strings – obliged to occupy the same platform space, Manze’s performance concentrated instead on revealing inner detail, all of it, like the solo viola line that’s woven around one of the final statements of the main theme, lovingly shaped. There was the same care over orchestral detail in The Lark Ascending too, though the centre of attention was naturally the violin playing of Daniel Pioro, who led the solo line on an ever more ecstatic spiral, full of expressive nudges and nuances. Earlier Pioro had also been the soloist in the London premiere of Tom Coult’s violin concerto Pleasure Garden, which he had introduced with the BBC Philharmonic in Manchester a year ago. Here it seemed a lucidly shaped work, a treasure trove of luscious orchestral colours and effects, that is convincing enough even without the detailed extra-musical explanations that Coult provides for each of the four movements; his music rarely lapses into anything obviously illustrative or anecdotal. The account of Vaughan Williams’s final symphony – “possibly his greatest masterpiece”, Manze suggested in a brief podium introduction – was fierce, and suitably enigmatic.

A four-point plan will cap, for 12 months, the price of black coal at $125 a tonne and the price of gas at $12 a gigajoule, within about a week. The commonwealth will transfer $1.5bn to the states and territories to cut energy bills for eligible households and small businesses. Federal parliament will be recalled next week to pass legislation, particularly to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission more powers. New South Wales’ parliament will amend laws for the coal industry, most likely early in 2023. How soon will energy costs fall? The direct benefits are expected to flow to households and businesses by the June quarter of 2023. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will work with state and territory counterparts to determine how the $1.5bn in commonwealth support will be shared. Those receiving welfare payments such as pensions, jobseeker or family tax benefits, will have their energy bills reduced. Small businesses will also be in line for rebates with eligibility yet to be settled. The other relief will come via the projected fall in wholesale electricity prices because coal- and gas-fired power plants won’t have to pay as much for their fuel. While most of their fuel is on cheaper long-term contracts, the portion exposed to spot prices – for example, about 20% for Origin Energy’s Eraring coal plant in NSW – does fluctuate. Clare Savage, the Australian Energy Regulator chair, told Friday’s meeting that even the federal government talking about restrictions had put “downward pressure” on wholesale power prices. Treasury modelling indicates that instead of retail power prices rising 36% in the 2023-24 fiscal year, the increase will be trimmed to 23%. Gas prices, instead of rising 20% this year and next as forecast in the federal budget, are instead expected to increase 18% and 4%. The saving for the average household will be $230 next financial year compared to no interventions. NSW, Victoria and Queensland at this stage may not add to their existing energy support programs, the Guardian understands, while the ACT is expected to boost its assistance. Will it work? All else being equal, bills should be smaller at least for the year-long period of the price caps. The governments will be hoping Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – the main driver of soaring global energy prices – will be over then too. Concerns that the transfer of $1.5bn will be inflationary are alleviated because recipients won’t get the money as cash. Lower wholesale energy prices should also help, resulting in an estimated 0.5 percentage trimming of next year’s inflation rate. Prices caps imply producers could get more for their gas and coal if they exported it. To make sure they don’t, the ACCC will get those beefed-up powers for gas and NSW for coal. Queensland can use existing laws. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, insisted on Friday the intervention won’t raise concerns about Australia’s sovereign risk, saying it would “have no effect” on existing export contracts. What has the reaction been? Mixed, as you might imagine, with so many interests at stake. The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the announcement demonstrated that Labor’s pre-election promise that average household power prices would be on average $275 lower by 2025 was “dead and buried”. As such, it marked “a significant broken promise” by the Albanese government, about six months into its term, Dutton said. Lynne Gallagher, the CEO of Energy Consumers Australia, said the plan would bring relief for millions of households and businesses and help curtail further price increases. More detail, though, was needed before “every Australian could clearly understand what it would mean for their budget”, she said. Innes Willox, the CEO of Ai Group, an employer association, said that price caps would be “messy to implement and it would be better if we were not still so vulnerable to gyrations in these global fuel markets”. “But they look likely to be very helpful in dampening the immediate economic pain of this global energy crisis,” Willox said, adding his organisation was relieved governments were “working together to respond effectively”. However, the gas industry group Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the package was “radical”. The price cap and mandatory code of conduct would smash investor confidence, curbing future supplies. “Less gas will ultimately mean higher prices while threatening Australia’s energy security, our emissions reductions goals and the enormous economic benefits that the industry delivers for Australians,” the chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said. “With this decision the government has not given the heads of agreement with east coast exporters and the Australian gas industry code of conduct – both announced only 71 days ago – a chance to work,” she said, adding there had been no consultation. Tim Buckley, the director of Climate Energy Finance, said the rebates were important as “energy poverty affected the poorest hardest”. He said the fossil fuel industry should be grateful they weren’t being slapped with a special profit tax. He estimates the companies will book a gross profit in 2022 alone of $120bn. “These multinationals are using Australian public assets to make war-time profits,” Buckley said. “It’s time we shared some of these windfall gains.” Why was intervention needed? Despite Australia’s enviable resources – from fossil fuels to solar and wind – energy prices are mostly at the mercy of global markets. Western Australia, with its 2006 decision to reserve 15% of its gas for local use, is the exception, with among the lowest prices anywhere for energy, EnergyQuest says. Coal and gas often set the wholesale power price in eastern states, so electricity prices have soared, adding to inflationary pressure and the budgets of households and businesses. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, the average wholesale spot price in the national electricity market in the September quarter was $216/megawatt-hour. That was down on the June quarter’s record $264/MWh price but more than triple the $58/MWh of a year earlier. Wholesale prices make up about a third of total power bills. For eastern states, September-quarter gas prices averaged $26/gj, a 142% increase from a year earlier and only slightly below the $28.40/gj price in the April-June period. Historically, prices were about $3/gj before opening up to global markets. The ACCC said as of August this year, the majority of offers to commercial and industrial gas users for supply next year were above $30/gj “which is the highest we have seen”. A $12/gj would offer “a reasonable return on capital for a 12-month period”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T17:17:27Z","webTitle":" Russia launches six hypersonic missiles in massive barrage against Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia launched six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences in the early hours of Thursday morning as it unleashed its largest missile barrage against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. At least six people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 440 miles (700km) from the frontline, according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. In the capital, Kyiv, the seven-hour alert through the night was the longest of Russia’s five-month air campaign. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. For much of Thursday the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – was forced to rely on diesel-powered generators after Ukrainian authorities said missile attacks had damaged power lines. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the frontline and both sides have warned of a potential for nuclear accidents there caused by fighting. The power grid operator Ukrenergo said in the afternoon that the power supply had been restored and the plant was switching away from generators. Russian-installed officials called the temporary cutoff a Ukrainian provocation. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, urged again for a protection zone around the plant. “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,” he told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation board of governors. Ukraine’s air force said the attack comprised, in total, “81 missiles of various types”, launched from Russian aircraft and carriers in the Black Sea. Defence forces destroyed 34 cruise missiles and four drones, it added. “Unfortunately, a missile of the Kinzhal type hit an infrastructure object,” said Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv region’s military administration. The military administration said 40% of people in the capital were without heating on Thursday morning. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the Holosiivskyi district, and two people were wounded in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Smoke could be seen rising from a facility in Holosiivskyi and police cordoned off all roads leading to it. The governor of Odesa region said a mass missile attack hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also struck. Kharkiv was left without electricity as a result of the overnight attack, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn and an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. Multiple settlements were shelled on Wednesday, damaging houses and commercial buildings, he added. Other blasts were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said the strikes were in response to what Moscow called a terrorist attack in Bryansk region last week, when members of a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps staged an incursion from Ukraine. Russia said two civilians were killed in the incident, which Ukraine accused Moscow of staging as a false “provocation”. The missile barrage came after Ukraine’s military said late on Wednesday it had managed to push back intense Russian attacks on the city of Bakhmut, despite a Russian claim of control over its eastern half. As one of the bloodiest battles of the year-long war ground on in the small city’s ruins, Ukrainian defenders – who last week appeared to be preparing for a tactical retreat – remained defiant. “The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a letup in storming the city of Bakhmut,” the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. “Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.” The battle for Bakhmut, which is still under Kyiv’s control, has raged for seven months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of buildings collapsed or charred. The few remaining civilians have been confined to basements for months with no running water, electricity or gas. Ukrainian military and political leaders now speak of hanging on to positions and inflicting as many casualties as possible on the Russians to grind down their fighting capability. Despite rumours of an imminent retreat of his troops, Zelenskiy said during an address on Wednesday evening that he had instructed the Ukrainian army to find forces to bolster the defence of the city. “I told the chief of staff to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said the battle for Bakhmut and the surrounding Donbas region was “our first priority”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/31/golden-shares-to-safeguard-sustainability-at-tonys-chocolonely","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T19:07:26Z","webTitle":"‘Golden shares’ to safeguard sustainability at Tony’s Chocolonely","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/31/golden-shares-to-safeguard-sustainability-at-tonys-chocolonely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/31/golden-shares-to-safeguard-sustainability-at-tonys-chocolonely","fields":{"bodyText":"The ethical confectionery company Tony’s Chocolonely has introduced a “golden share” mechanism to prevent shareholders from weakening its sustainability commitments in future. In an unusual move, the Dutch company, which makes colourfully wrapped chunky chocolate bars stocked in UK supermarkets, has created a new governance structure with golden shares that carry the power to veto changes to its ethical strategy. The shares will be safeguarded by independent “mission guardians” who have the power to prevent legal changes to its sourcing principles and “mission” to eradicate inequality and exploitation in the chocolate industry. Tony’s, which advertises its goods as “100% exploitation free”, sources from Ghana and Ivory Coast. The group is owned by co-founder Maurice Dekkers and five other shareholders, including: two former directors, current employees and JamJar Investments, the investment firm backed by the founders of Innocent Drinks. Verlinvest – an investment company backed by two of the families behind Belgian brewing giant AB InBev which also has stakes in the oat drink maker Oatly – is also an investor in Tony’s. The guardian roles will be filled by the sustainable entrepreneur Seth Goldman, the former boss of Honest Tea who is chair of the vegan brand Beyond Meat; the British-Nigerian lawyer and TV presenter Ikenna Azuike; and the former Tony’s board member Anne-Wil Dijkstra. They will be given several methods besides the golden shares to publicly or legally hold Tony’s leadership to account. Any stakeholder – employees, cocoa farmers, business partners or consumers – can anonymously raise concerns with the guardians. The guardians can then work with senior management to resolve any concern. If that fails, the trio have the right to publish their concerns in the company’s annual report and through full-page newspaper adverts, or refer the matter for legal investigation and arbitration at the enterprise chamber of the court of appeal in Amsterdam. The Tony’s chief executive, Douglas Lamont, said he hoped the move would inspire other brands to follow suit. “A growing number of purpose-driven companies are looking for ways to secure their impact models at the core of their business permanently and irrevocably, independent of shareholder structure,” he said. “With this model, we hope to role-model what we believe to be a powerful mechanism to protect our mission and sourcing principles forever and act as an inspiration for others to look more closely at what they can do to secure their mission too.” Goldman said: “I’ve learnt from my own experience that, even when we create companies with the highest aspirations in mission, times change, people change, new people come in, and organisations change too. So, no mission is guaranteed.” “Like anything new and unproven, I’m sure we will learn along the way. But I also hope our approach can become a model for other purpose-driven brands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2022/dec/08/beethoven-piano-sonatas-op-101-op-106-hammerklavier-review-maurizio-pollini","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T15:30:05Z","webTitle":"Beethoven: Piano Sonatas Op 101 & Op 106, ‘Hammerklavier’ review – the power of Pollini | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/08/beethoven-piano-sonatas-op-101-op-106-hammerklavier-review-maurizio-pollini","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/dec/08/beethoven-piano-sonatas-op-101-op-106-hammerklavier-review-maurizio-pollini","fields":{"bodyText":"It took Maurizio Pollini more than 30 years to complete his recordings of the Beethoven piano sonatas for Deutsche Grammophon. The first instalment of that series, which appeared in 1977, was devoted to the last five sonatas, including magisterial performances of the two paired on this new release, which was recorded in Munich’s Herkulessaal in June 2021 and April this year. In the 1970s Pollini was at the height of his powers, a level that he maintained well into this century, and which has assured him a place among the greatest pianists of our time. But in the past 10 years or so his live appearances have become more erratic, with nondescript, uninvolved performances outweighing those evenings when he recaptured his old mastery. The relatively few studio recordings Pollini has made over the past decade have proved much more consistent. His approach, whether to Beethoven or Chopin, Debussy or Schoenberg, always tended towards the analytical, and he has never been a great keyboard colourist. In his later years his playing has become even more severe, but his intellectual grip on the music has remained as secure as ever. His discs of Chopin, with the pieces grouped chronologically, for instance, were often revelatory. All of which makes his return, in the year he turned 80, to two of the most intellectually and technically challenging works in the piano repertoire compelling listening. There’s no doubt his muscular authority in late Beethoven is as commanding as ever, even if technically the performances may not be quite as pristine and brilliant as they would have been half a century ago: there are moments in the fugal finale of Op 106 that seem congested, though that may also be because of the sheer speed at which Pollini launches into this fearsome movement. For what’s extraordinary is that, when compared with the 1977 recordings, every single movement in both sonatas is faster this time, yet there are few moments when those speeds seem excessive. There is something slightly chilly about this pianist’s approach, and many may prefer a warmer, more human touch to these sonatas, especially in the wonderfully intimate Op 101. Yet one is always aware of the wealth of experience and understanding that is informing every bar of his playing. Throughout his long career Pollini has divided opinion, and this fine disc is a reminder that he continues to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/06/anthony-albanese-says-postponing-energy-market-meeting-with-premiers-wont-delay-power-price-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T00:50:19Z","webTitle":"Anthony Albanese says postponing energy market meeting with premiers won’t delay power price relief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/06/anthony-albanese-says-postponing-energy-market-meeting-with-premiers-wont-delay-power-price-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/06/anthony-albanese-says-postponing-energy-market-meeting-with-premiers-wont-delay-power-price-relief","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese says postponing this week’s national cabinet meeting with the premiers will not delay power price relief for Australians, because the proposed changes will not take effect until next February. The prime minister was due to dine with premiers and chief ministers on Tuesday evening to try to broker a cooperative regulatory intervention in the energy market. Wednesday’s national cabinet discussion has now been delayed until Friday. The prime minister returned a positive test for Covid-19 on Monday night, and went into isolation at his Sydney residence, Kirribilli House. Albanese said Friday’s meeting with his state and territory counterparts would now be virtual, and he would remain in isolation until he was asymptomatic. After the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, criticised the delay, saying households and businesses battling exponential price increases had no time to wait, Albanese told the ABC on Tuesday delaying the conversation would have no material impact on the timing of the regulatory intervention. “National cabinet will be on Friday, but the idea that you make a decision and it has an impact immediately on prices is not right of course,” the prime minister said. He said a new default market offer for electricity users would probably be in place in February “so what we are looking at is trying to act before Christmas, which is what we said we would do”. “There’s no actual delay in anything except the formal meeting that will take place now on Friday,” he said. “We had to make a call pretty quickly because the positive test came through at five o’clock [Monday] night.” Albanese was asked why he didn’t persist with national cabinet on Wednesday as a virtual meeting given he was well enough to do a “proof of life” radio interview by telephone on Tuesday. Albanese said the circumstances called for a snap decision on Monday night and the prime minister insisted it made no material difference. “The impact, apart from people who want to speculate in the media, is zero.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Albanese was asked when he would share key details with the premiers about how the proposed intervention would work. The prime minister suggested his state and territory counterparts had those details to hand, and some of the public positioning in recent days was about maximising their own bargaining position. “You’ve got to draw a distinction between what premiers … say in public in order to promote their own position and what is actually happening, and what’s happening is very constructive dialogue,” the prime minister said. “People have been given a whole lot of detail about what is proposed. People have also been given the legal advice, and bureaucrats have been working this through for weeks, and I’ve had discussions with the premiers over the weekend and again [on Monday] and last week.” “These things are being worked through constructively and I will continue to work this through with them in constructive fashion”. Guardian Australia revealed last week the Albanese government may struggle to provide comprehensive energy price relief unless NSW and Queensland were prepared to cooperate with a plan to temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal. During a briefing in a federal cabinet meeting last Monday, ministers heard the commonwealth has the regulatory levers to reduce gas prices for industrial users, but there was concern a replica intervention in the coal market might be more complex for Canberra to execute and could open the possibility of legal challenges, given producers will resist. The NSW government has rejected this, saying it has a legal opinion that suggests Canberra can impose a cap on coal prices. The state energy minister, Matt Kean, has urged quick action. Last week the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, declared the Albanese government needed to keep its “hands off our generators”. Palaszczuk then doubled down on Monday. She told reporters in Brisbane there would “have to be adequate compensation” if she were to agree to Albanese’s price cap proposal. “As I said in the parliament last week, and I’ve stuck to my guns in relation to this, we would have to be very, very convinced that no Queenslander would be worse off,” the premier said. The Albanese government has been indicating it will intervene significantly in the energy market since budget week in October, when Treasury forecasts predicted power prices would increase by 56% by the end of next year. The government has been pursuing price caps for coal and gas, and the intervention will also include making the gas industry code of conduct mandatory. Albanese said every political leader in the country had an interest in landing the regulatory intervention because the alternative was more pain for households and existential pressure on manufacturing businesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/07/vladimir-putin-says-russias-war-on-ukraine-could-be-long-term-process","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T17:31:55Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin says Russia’s war in Ukraine could be ‘long-term process’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/vladimir-putin-says-russias-war-on-ukraine-could-be-long-term-process","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/07/vladimir-putin-says-russias-war-on-ukraine-could-be-long-term-process","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. But mainly the Russian president defended the “special military operation” – his preferred term for what he openly admitted was a Russian war of conquest that he compared with the territorial ambitions of former Russian tsars. “As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. “But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.” Russia has been forced to abandon some of those “annexed” territories, notably fleeing the city of Kherson last month due to a sweeping Ukrainian counterattack. Russia now shells the city of Kherson regularly from the other side of the Dnipro River, in effect attacking what it considers its own territory. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, defended that tactic last week by saying the Russians had also shelled Stalingrad during the second world war. In his remarks on Wednesday, Putin denied his administration was planning for another round of mass mobilisation. He claimed that of 300,000 mobilised Russians, just half had been sent into the conflict zone, while the others were still at training ranges. “In these conditions, any talk about additional mobilisation proceedings simply doesn’t make sense. The state and the defence ministries simply don’t need this at present,” he said. The previous round of mobilisation, announced in mid-September, had been preceded by official denials as well. Putin also denied the Russian army had suffered from mass desertions in Ukraine fuelled by poor conditions and low morale. That followed reports from independent Russian media about secret prison camps in Russian-occupied Donbas where dozens of soldiers who had refused to fight were being held in abysmal conditions. “Are there guys who deserted their combat posts? Yes, it happened … less and less now,” he said. “I repeat once again that no cases of such nature [desertions] have a mass character.” Putin dedicated some of his remarks to questions about the potential for nuclear war, which he said was growing more likely due to the conflict with the west. “This threat is increasing, I can’t deny it,” Putin said in response to a question, adding that Russia would not use those weapons first. “We have not gone crazy, we are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are more advanced and more modern than those of any other nuclear country. As of today, this is an obvious fact. “We are not going to wave these weapons around like a razor, running around the world, but of course we act with the understanding that they exist.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/13/labour-vows-to-treble-solar-power-use-during-first-term-if-elected","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T21:30:18Z","webTitle":"Labour vows to treble solar power use during first term if elected","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/labour-vows-to-treble-solar-power-use-during-first-term-if-elected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/13/labour-vows-to-treble-solar-power-use-during-first-term-if-elected","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour has criticised prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland and vowed to treble the renewable energy source in its first term. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, will visit a solar farm on Friday. He is to lay out his opposition to plans by Truss and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, who the Guardian revealed earlier this week are hoping to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land. “This government cannot deliver when you have a prime minister who is a longstanding opponent of solar, and an environment secretary doing her bidding,” Miliband told the Guardian. Labour is hoping to make the most of a cabinet rift over energy strategy. On Thursday, the business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, came out in opposition to plans to ban solar. In a piece for the Guardian, Rees-Mogg insisted he was persuaded of the need to boost renewable energy. He also revealed new policies including loosening regulations for businesses to put solar power in place and giving homeowners grants to install panels on their houses. Miliband said: “The problem for Liz Truss is that her anti-clean-power dogma is now catching up with her.” Labour is to say that blocking solar would “rob the UK of potential for cheap power that could bring down bills for households” and tell voters that even before the Ukraine crisis, new solar was a quarter of the price of gas. Miliband will accuse Truss of trying to “destroy the solar industry” and argue this will “make the UK energy sector even more insecure”. Labour’s calculations show each 5GW of additional solar would cut UK gas imports by 2%, and that solar power could supply 17% of the UK’s annual electricity needs by 2035, supporting 60,000 jobs. He will also declare Labour’s plans to block fracking, saying that this and an expansion of solar would make the UK a “world-leading clean energy superpower” by 2030. At their party conference, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, announced plans to deliver a zero-carbon electricity system by 2030 as well as to create a publicly owned clean energy company. The Liberal Democrats have also criticised Truss’s plans. Their chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain, the MP for North East Fife, said: “People are facing higher energy bills, and the UK urgently needs more renewable, reliable energy … solar power is clean, cheap and popular.

Iranian and US officials, with the EU acting as mediators, held two days of talks in Doha in a bid to break a months-long impasse, but no progress was made on Iran’s central demand that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from US sanctions and its list of foreign terrorist organisations. “Not only has Iran not taken up the offer on the table, but it also added yet more issues which fall outside the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] with maximalist and unrealistic demands,” the French ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivière, said on Thursday. The broader talks have been stalled since March, but the recent fresh restrictions placed on UN weapons inspectors – as well as Iran’s speeding up of uranium enrichment – has injected a sudden urgency into the crisis. Western leaders will have to take decisive steps including reimposing UN sanctions in weeks if the nuclear inspectorate continues to be unable to carry out its monitoring duties. During the special session of the UN security council, Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy, warned Iran that no better deal was going to be offered. Olof Skoog, the EU’s ambassador to the UN, said: “I am concerned that we might not make it over the finishing line. My message is: seize this opportunity to conclude the deal, based on the text that is on the table. The time to overcome the last outstanding issues, conclude the deal and fully restore the [agreement] is now.” The context of the impasse – growing Iranian enrichment and ballistic missile activity – is also concerning European leaders. Woodward warned: “Iran’s nuclear programme has never been more advanced than it is today and Iran’s nuclear escalation is a threat to international peace and security.” “At the current enrichment rate, by the end of this year, Iran is likely to have enough enriched material to rapidly produce highly enriched uranium at 90% enrichment for several nuclear devices,” she said. “Iran also continues to develop ballistic missiles in a way that is inconsistent with UN resolutions.” In a joint statement, Germany, France and the UK claimed that Iran was testing ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. The statement said: “Only a few days ago, Iran conducted another test of a space launch vehicle, which contains dual-use technology that can be used to construct long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.” The Iranian ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said an agreement was “not out of reach” but that success required significant changes in US policy, specifically regarding the imposition of sanctions. He also said guarantees were needed that the US would not leave the deal again as they had under Donald Trump in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/13/carbon-free-energy-fusion-reaction-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T16:10:12Z","webTitle":"The carbon-free energy of the future: this fusion breakthrough changes everything | Arthur Turrell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/13/carbon-free-energy-fusion-reaction-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/13/carbon-free-energy-fusion-reaction-scientists","fields":{"bodyText":"This is a moment that scientists have dreamed of for well over half a century. The US’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) has smashed the longest-standing goal in the quest for carbon-free energy from fusion, the nuclear process that powers stars. Researchers from NIF used the world’s most energetic laser to fire 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy into a millimetre-sized capsule of hydrogen fuel. Reaching temperatures many times those found in the sun’s core and pressures 300bn times those normally experienced on Earth, a wave of nuclear reactions ripped through the fusion fuel, releasing 3.15 MJ of fusion energy – 1.1 MJ more than was put in – over a few tens of nanoseconds. Now this is not exciting because of the absolute energy released — that was small, only enough to boil two or three kettles. And it’s not even exciting because of any new physics: fusion experts have long argued that you just need a hammer of a certain size to make the thing “go”, and NIF has obliged by upping the input laser energy considerably. (That said, the physical precision behind this machine is astonishing: as little as a 0.1% error in the timing of the laser energy can degrade the conditions needed for fusion by as much as 50%.) No, this is exciting because it’s the first scientific proof that fusion can produce more energy out than is put in, also known as “net energy gain”. If the numbers check out, the experiment generated 54% more energy than was put into it. Releasing energy through fusion reactions isn’t unusual in the wider universe: the sun produces 4bn kilograms’ worth of pure energy from fusion reactions every single second. But, despite decades of hopes pinned on fusion as a clean and plentiful energy source on Earth, no one has ever shown it can release more energy than is needed to set it off – pretty fundamental for a power source. That is, until now. What does it all mean? As ice and snow grip the UK, I hardly need say why energy is a good thing. It makes our lives better in a million and one ways. As a planet, we need a lot more of it. Nuclear fission and renewables are absolutely part of that story, but if the technology can be perfected, fusion offers carbon-free energy for everyone on the planet for thousands, probably millions, of years. It doesn’t create long-lived radioactive waste, and there’s no chance of meltdowns such as those at Chornobyl and Fukushima. Fusion would complement renewables by providing baseload energy, rain or shine, while taking up little precious land. So the prize is big – which is why scientists and engineers have stuck with it for decades. This nuclear breakthrough is, in many ways, what every fusion scientist has been waiting for. Before this, they couldn’t even claim the scientific principle was empirical fact. That made it hard to build momentum behind turning fusion into a power source. Now, they can say “it works!”. Producing star power on Earth is no longer a dream. Of course, that doesn’t mean fusion power that we can use is a reality yet. This is a single result on a single experiment. A commercially viable plant would need to produce 30 times energy out for energy in (30x), rather than the 1.54x seen in this experiment. Even with that magnitude of energy release, there would be engineering and economic challenges to overcome, such as firing the laser 10 times a second, rather than once a day. Gigantic lasers may not even be the best route to economical fusion power: promising alternative approaches are being explored that use magnetic fields to trap the 150mC fuel. And when fusion pessimists say NIF hasn’t produced more energy than it took to charge the laser batteries, they’re right – but this facility was only ever meant to demonstrate scientific feasibility; no government would fund a prototype power plant without hitting this milestone first, and there’s still a long road between this experimental result and a power plant. So this stunning achievement may not appear to bring us much closer to fusion power being available on the grid … at least, not directly. Indirectly, psychologically, the effect is akin to a trumpet to the ear: we now know fusion for energy is possible. Knowledge that fusion can work changes everything, including how willing everyone from governments to entrepreneurs will be to invest. With more resources, higher gains in energy can be pursued, and a virtuous cycle of development is now likely to be set in motion. Nature has seen fit to make the science of nuclear fusion such that it can produce energy. Whether we now turn that fusion energy into a power source – well, that’s down to us.

Speaking to a committee of MEPs in the European parliament, Mark MacGann, who was Uber’s top lobbyist in Europe, said the cab-hailing company’s practices were “borderline immoral” as he recalled the “almost unlimited finance” executives had to lobby and silence drivers with legal disputes. MacGann said he hoped his testimony would help the lawmakers understand why “giving disproportionate power in legislation to huge tech platforms risks shattering the social justice” MEPs had sought to defend. The former Uber lobbyist also urged European lawmakers to ensure that drivers were better protected as a result of draft legislation being thrashed out by MEPs and EU ministers. The EU is debating proposals that would require gig-economy companies to ensure workers get the minimum wage, access to sick pay and holidays. It would also shift the burden of proof on employment status to companies, rather than the individuals who work for them. Speaking alongside MacGann, Nicolas Schmit, the EU commissioner for jobs and social rights, said he was concerned his proposals were being watered down by EU ministers, by weakening the presumption of employee status. MacGann said it would be unfair for drivers to be required to hire expensive lawyers and go to labour courts to prove they were employees. “The financial burden has to be on those who can afford it, which means the platform companies and not the drivers,” he said. “Companies like Uber have so much money to drown you in legal fees,” he said. Speaking to the Guardian after the hearing, MacGann said he would like to help other whistleblowers speak out about wrongdoing whether in government or private companies. He added: “I have a platform, I have a voice to help out as much as I can the workers in Europe, who are trying to get their voices heard … I don’t know what the shelf life of that job is, whether it is weeks or months, so I am taking it day by day.” In 2015-16 when MacGann worked at the company, Uber spent $90m (£48m) on lobbying and communication and had “tens, if not hundreds of millions” available globally for expensive lawyers, he said. “I am not qualified to talk about the legality of Uber’s lobbying practices, I just think that some of it for me is borderline immoral.” While he said “well-organised transparent lobbying” was fundamental to parliamentary democracy, he told MEPs it should concern any democrat when the balance of power was so skewed. “When tech companies have disproportionate financial resources to push their message, at the expense of the far less powerful workers upon whom their model is built – there is something truly undemocratic happening.” Turning the spotlight broader, he said the EU had been “complicit” in Uber’s practices, by allowing member states “to fight against each other”, ie by competing to lure the company to set up operations in their country. He also urged governments to show more “intellectual honesty” about their treatment of companies such as Uber, recalling that it was “quite surreal” that Uber was raided by Amsterdam police, while in The Hague others “were quite happy” to have the company, which was seen as creating jobs. Asked about corruption, MacGann, who was involved in Uber’s lobbying in 22 countries, said he did not believe “anyone was bribed or there was any active corruption” but that the company had “unequal unprecedented access to the very highest levels” in every European member state and the European Commission. He recalled that governments were swayed by the perception that “all these cool kids from Silicon Valley” were going to generate much-needed economic growth, which meant some ministers turned a blind eye to the company’s “highly unorthodox” methods. Giving testimony, he said his experience of being a whistleblower had been “very difficult” and lonely. He had tried twice to share his experiences with elected officials, he said, naming the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the European parliament’s employment and social affairs committee – the very MEPs he addressed on Tuesday. When neither took him up, he handed 124,000 company files to the Guardian, which were shared with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. MEPs and staffers in the packed committee room responded with two standing ovations, while chair Dragoş Pîslaru described MacGann’s testimony as “amazing” and a “historical moment for the parliament”. MacGann was Uber’s head of public policy between 2014 and 2016, a post that led him to the highest echelons of power in the UK, France and Russia. He oversaw Uber’s attempts to persuade governments to change taxi regulations and create a favourable business environment for the Silicon Valley company. The trove of company documents revealed how Uber flouted the law, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments across the world. The files received the extraordinary lengths Emmanuel Macron went to as economy minister to support Uber’s campaign to disrupt France’s closed-shop taxi industry. It also revealed how Uber used a “kill switch” to prevent police and regulators from accessing company data during raids on its offices in six countries. MEPs also asked about revelations that former EU commissioner Neelie Kroes secretly helped Uber to lobby a string of Dutch politicians, including the prime minister Mark Rutte. Last month the EU’s anti-fraud office announced it had opened an investigation into Kroes, saying it intended to gather evidence in order to “in order to confirm or deny the allegations”. Schmit declined to comment on the case, citing the ongoing anti-fraud operation, as did MacGann, who said he had “admiration and respect” for the Dutch politician who led the EU’s internet policy. MacGann had refused to appear on the same panel as a current Uber employee, so MEPs heard separately from Uber’s director of EU public policy, Zuzana Púčiková, who said Uber had changed since his departure. “Everyone knows that Uber made mistakes in its early days,” she said, adding that the company did not defend past practices. “But everyone knows that Uber has changed. “The Uber I know is built on strong values. Today our values are about doing the right thing,” she said referring to the company’s support for Ukrainian refugees. “The Uber I know has robust ethics and compliance policies that all employees must comply with.” She said Uber welcomed the EU’s draft directive on platform workers, but wanted “to caution against an approach that would classify them as employees”, claiming that most drivers did not want this status."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T13:14:03Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s energy security strategy won’t bring down our eye-watering heating bills | Eleanor Salter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","fields":{"bodyText":"At last, the energy security strategy has been published, after weeks of hedging, briefing and delays. The original aims of the strategy, which was initially promised on 7 March, were worthy: to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from Russian fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine. There was also hope in the climate world that the strategy would go further and faster in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The cost of renewables has tumbled, and the UK’s leaky housing stock is crying out for retrofitting. This was an opportunity for an urgent response both to the climate and cost of living crises. But for something that was motivated by a war and an energy crisis, the headline policies of the resulting document strikingly fail to address either. One of the cornerstone issues is timescale: the strategy is big on infrastructure commitments such as new nuclear power plants and offshore wind farms, which won’t be fully operational for years, if not decades. Radical reform of the planning system to allow more onshore wind, one of the quickest and cheapest short-term salves to high energy bills, is absent. In its place there is a milquetoast commitment to “consulting on developing partnerships for a limited number of supportive communities”. Months after Cop26, the strategy has committed to licensing and drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. Its climate ambitions are therefore deeply questionable. The majority of this oil is tagged for export; as Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, pointed out, domestic production won’t address energy bills but will only help fossil fuel executives get richer. Without nationalisation, new oil and gas will be sold at the market rate. Shell made a profit of $19.3bn (£14.7bn) last year. Other energy companies have also been raking it in, benefiting from the extortionate price of gas. Instead of imposing a windfall tax on these oil and gas companies that could help fund energy saving measures, the government’s strategy does the precise opposite. New oil and gas could blow a gigantic hole in the UK’s carbon budget. Licensing new exploration is a brazen move even for the Johnson government, committing to oil and gas in the same week as the devastating IPCC report confirmed existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will far exceed the 1.5C limit. This rushed energy security strategy, which is likely to be incompatible with the government’s other stated climate targets of net zero by 2050, is what happens when you push policies through the weird prism of the Tory party. Although the Johnson administration is no stranger to disorder, producing the energy security strategy has been chaos on a new scale. Over the past few weeks, the prime minister has been attempting to put out multiple fires across his party. Headlines have been peppered with briefings and counter-briefings. On 23 March, the Guardian trailed that Johnson would champion onshore wind in defiance of his Nimby backbenchers. A mere fortnight later, he apparently backed away from onshore wind after over 100 backbenchers lobbied against the policy. As a result, the new strategy has something for everyone, but pleases no one. A new survey into fracking has been ordered as bait to the Tory right, with Kwarteng claiming the government will be “guided by the science on shale gas”. But little has changed in the UK’s geology since the moratorium on fracking was enforced in 2019. Another problem with this strategy is deeply familiar. While it presents a bundle of promises, there is no money to back these up. The key phrase to look out for is “up to”. Nuclear power could provide “up to 24GW by 2050”. The government will “look to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to 5 times by 2035”. Even “we would like to see up to 5GW from floating offshore wind”. These are not targets, they are vague intimations. The energy strategy is silent on one fundamental issue – reducing energy demand. Widely reported wrangling between the Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Number 10 is to blame. Energy efficiency measures are the quickest and cheapest way to lower energy bills and end reliance on Russian fossil fuels. They are also necessary for decarbonisation. But the Treasury blocked a proposal to expand the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which provides insulation measures to low-income households. This spat seemed petty to the point of ridicule: departments are bickering over a £200m top-up to an existing policy when an enormous, nationwide retrofit campaign will be both necessary and inevitable as our planet warms. The problem is not only of ideological difference, but also ideological vacuum. Most civil servants had no idea a strategy was even in the pipeline when Johnson promised it four weeks ago. But a frenzy in Whitehall to make up policy on the hoof has become a common trait of this government, whose manifesto was slender and whose party consensus is messy on almost every issue. Coordination across the cabinet is beyond Johnson’s reach, partly because he is weak and partly because he doesn’t know what he stands for. In 2012, he called wind turbines “white satanic mills” whose “collective oomph wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. Now, he’s blowing hard for offshore wind. Johnson finds himself up against a popular, anti-spend chancellor and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. Despite his 80-seat majority, he is unable to convince his backbenchers of the need for swift commitments to the cost-of-living and climate crises, whilst we career towards 3.2C warming. He has to squeeze everything past a reticent chancellor and a party whose backbenchers are a decade behind public opinion. The result is a mash of promised policies which don’t tackle the issue of energy security. Without seriously contemplating a reduction in our energy demand or fast-tracking renewables, the strategy simply does not address what it was created for in the first place – ending dependence on a belligerent Russia, and bringing down eye-watering bills. Instead, the ragged Tory consensus is to deliver high-intensity infrastructure at some indefinite point in the future, and a failure to rise to the urgency required on energy for both people and planet.

When violence erupted in Pakistan last week, after the arrest of the former prime minister on corruption charges, the government and the military vowed stringent action against all those who took part in the attacks on dozens of government buildings and military leaders’ homes and headquarters. At least nine people were killed in the violence and hundreds injured. The prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, described those who carried out the violence as “terrorists” and the powerful military establishment said that those responsible for the “heinous crimes” would be tried under military laws. On Friday, Sharif said he had directed law enforcement to leave no stone unturned in finding those responsible. But Khan alleged that it was a thinly veiled excuse to launch a “reign of terror” upon members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) who were being rounded up across the country. “Under the garb of identifying arsonists, fascist tactics have been employed by these criminals in power to silence and oppress PTI workers and supporters,” he said. The government has accused Khan of sheltering “30 to 40 terrorists” involved in the violence in his Lahore home. On Friday evening, a four-member delegation of the Punjab police arrived at Khan’s home with a warrant, and began carrying out a search in front of the media. PTI said police were given “full cooperation” and that the officers had left empty-handed. Khan has alleged that the violence of 9 May was carried out by those working for the state and military agencies as a means of tarnishing PTI. Speaking briefly to reporters during a court appearance on Friday, he said: “It seems as if all civil liberties and all fundamental rights are finished. Only the courts are protecting human rights now.” On Friday, Khan was granted bail in several more of the cases filed against him – totalling more than 100 – but alleged the state intended on re-arresting him as soon as it legally could. Amir Mir, the information minister, said Khan was the “prime accused” in the violence. He refuted Khan’s account that 7,000 people had been arrested in the operation and confirmed that 3,428 had been arrested so far. Mir said: “No one innocent has been arrested.” Using video and CCTV footage, as well as information gathered from WhatsApp groups, police had compiled a list of 25,000 people responsible and intended to arrest about 5,000 who were directly involved in attacks on government and military property, he said. “There are 800 people we have arrested who will be tried in military courts and anti-terrorism courts,” said Mir. “Those who broke into buildings and attacked or set sensitive places on fire will be tried in the military courts.” Senior PTI leaders also continued to be detained en masse, accused of being involved in orchestrating the violence. Among them was PTI’s former human rights minister Shireen Mazari, who was re-arrested this week even though the Islamabad court had given her protection from arrest. Haider Ali Butt, a political activist and lawyer in Lahore, said across the city there was a police crackdown on anyone associated with Khan’s party. “State machinery is doing nothing else except raiding PTI workers and their supporters’ homes,” said Butt. “They are even arresting workers who were not involved in the protests. Those accused of being involved in arson or vandalism or attacks on government building are being handed over to anti-terrorism police.” Among those picked up in Lahore was Ayaan Ali, 22, a Khan supporter accused of taking part in an arson attack on the house of a senior military leader. “My father in law is still in a state of shock that his son was arrested and taken away. He can’t believe it,” said Babar Awan, his brother-in-law. “He was in the police station the entire day yesterday, he could not meet him. We are really concerned about him.” Several lawyers and politicians raised concerns over the plans to try the arrested civilians in military courts, which Amnesty condemned as a “violation of international law”. Though a law was passed in 2015 allowing terrorists to be tried under army law, such action against civilian protesters on a large scale would be unprecedented in Pakistan. “This has social, political and legal problems and consequences,” said Asad Jamal, a lawyer opposing the edict, stating that it risked violating the constitution. Raza Rabbani, a senator with the Pakistan People’s party, a coalition partner in the ruling government, also spoke out against the plans. “If civilians are tried in military courts, it would be the violation of civil liberties and a grave violation of the fundamental right to a fair and transparent trial,” he said. “The attackers should be tried under the criminal justice system.” Some names have been changed to protect individuals’ identities"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/revealed-the-secret-british-plan-to-keep-italys-communists-from-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"Revealed: the secret British plan to keep Italy’s communists from power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/revealed-the-secret-british-plan-to-keep-italys-communists-from-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/revealed-the-secret-british-plan-to-keep-italys-communists-from-power","fields":{"bodyText":"On 7 June 1976, the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Panorama reported on the forthcoming Italian general election. Two weeks before the poll, the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI) – the largest communist party in Europe – stood “on the threshold of power”. Introducing the first foreign television interview with the then PCI leader, Enrico Berlinguer, David Dimbleby stood in front of a picture of Berlinguer captioned “Would you trust this man?” Highlighting the consequences of a PCI victory, Dimbleby informed BBC viewers that if Italy voted the party in, “the ripples will spread far beyond Italy itself”. The interview had been secured by one of Panorama’s leading correspondents, Richard Lindley. As Berlinguer sat with cigarettes and a drink to hand, Lindley interrogated him on his party’s attitude towards political repression in the Soviet Union, its commitment to Nato and, “if the cold war came again … where your loyalties would lie?” Lindley also pressed him on the strength of the PCI’s declared independence from the Soviet communist party, quoting a previous PCI leader’s reference to a “bond of steel” between the two parties. “Our independence is simply a fact,” Berlinguer said. The exchange caused satisfaction in Whitehall. “We were interested to note the ‘bond of steel’ quotation used by Lindley,” wrote a Foreign Office official, Peter Joy, to a colleague in Rome. “I assume you may have had the chance to talk to Lindley before the interview?” he wrote. “If so, well done!” Joy’s interest was not academic. He oversaw a top-secret unit of the Information Research Department (IRD), the covert cold war propaganda arm of the Foreign Office. The IRD’s Special Editorial Unit (SEU) was responsible for the department’s most sensitive operations, running propaganda missions around the world against communists and others deemed to threaten British interests. The unit worked closely with MI6. Recent investigations by the Observer have revealed how the IRD incited mass murder in Indonesia in the 1960s and ran a secret campaign to smear Oginga Odinga, the leftwing vice-president of Kenya. Now, newly declassified documents reveal that the IRD ran a campaign with MI6 to “undermine the credibility” of the Italian communist party and influence the 1976 election. According to Prof Scott Lucas of the University of Birmingham, the IRD appears to have crossed a line “that democracies don’t interfere in other countries’ democratic processes”, and Italy was “a fellow member of Nato, a fellow member of the European Economic Community and a democracy.” The declassified files reveal that embassy officials in Rome briefed Lindley, handing him an unattributed IRD memorandum on the PCI. It contained the quote attributed to former party leader Palmiro Togliatti about the “bonds of steel” which IRD claimed still characterised the PCI’s relationship with the Soviets. Heulyn Dunlop, an SEU official seconded to Rome for the campaign, reported that the correspondent planned to ask Berlinguer “a number of awkward questions”. Joy was later pleased to note: “Lindley succeed in getting under Berlinguer’s guard – especially on the Nato issue”. According to the then head of the IRD, Ray Whitney, the unattributable briefing paper was “a quarry of basic information on the party for the use of trusted contacts”. Journalists would be told it had been produced for diplomats, “but we are allowed to show them on a personal basis to people who may find them useful”. It provided Lindley with painstaking research on the PCI, including quotes from disparate sources that could be deployed against Berlinguer. The documents suggest that Lindley was unknown to the propagandists and unaware who was behind the briefing. The same brief was handed to foreign correspondents working for the Financial Times and Washington Post. Just as many observers now fear Italy’s new right-wing government might go soft on Putin’s Russia and disrupt the EU, in the mid-1970s British officials feared a similar outcome if the PCI joined a coalition. In local elections in 1975, the PCI won 33% of the vote, just behind the governing Christian Democrats, attracting support by attacking corruption, distancing itself from Moscow and committing to democracy, freedom and private enterprise. Berlinguer promised an accommodation with Nato and the EEC. The Foreign Office was divided on how genuine this was. Some believed Berlinguer’s leadership offered a chance of a “glittering prize” – detaching a western European communist party from Moscow – but others saw the PCI as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. In fact, KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin would later tell British intelligence that while Moscow continued to fund the PCI, the Soviets were dismayed by Berlinguer and, like the IRD, tried to discredit him. But the cold war warriors prevailed. Alarmed by Italy’s slide to the left, in November 1975 Foreign Office officials asked the IRD to target Berlinguer and his party and expose the contradiction between the PCI’s new democratic image and its official commitment to Marxism-Leninism. “We do not want the communist parties of western Europe to come to power in any form,” a senior British diplomat noted. They “must continue to be opposed by every possible means”. Britain’s ambassador in Rome argued it would be “catastrophic” if the PCI entered government. In April 1976, Britain’s new Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, appointed Anthony Crosland to replace him as foreign secretary. The declassified files show that the Foreign Office’s top mandarin, Sir Michael Palliser, told the incoming foreign secretary it was “not too late” to “prevent a communist accession to power in Italy” and promised him proposals. There was good reason for the Foreign Office to expect Crosland’s blessing. A dedicated social democrat, he opposed Soviet communism and had written critically about Eurocommunism. Four days after the date of the Italian election was announced, officials put forward their “options for action” in a paper sent to Crosland. It warned that PCI participation in government was “a very dangerous prospect” and that if the party achieved “majority participation … leading on to full power, the situation would probably have to be regarded as irretrievable by the Nato allies and Community partners”. A “clean surgical coup” was rejected as “unrealistic”, although “in the right circumstances”, officials mused, they could encourage the Italian government to repress the PCI, and suggested “it might be worth” arranging pretexts for this. But officials advised they could “orchestrate a campaign” against Berlinguer and the PCI, recommending “increased action in the propaganda field, both overt and covert, to undermine the credibility of the PCI”. While officials awaited Crosland’s approval, the documents reveal, the IRD was already starting covert operations. Dunlop of the SEU was seconded to the embassy in Rome to discover ways “to influence Italian opinion” to support “the middle ground in the run-up to the election”. Discussions began as to possible tactics. One IRD official suggested that “it might be rumour-mongered” that Alto Adige, a northern region transferred to Italy after the first world war, planned to declare independence or rejoin Austria if the PCI won. IRD wanted the BBC to broadcast western comment on “Italian political developments” to listeners to its Italian Service and reported they “seem very ready to be cooperative”. But in Rome, embassy diplomats feared “the direct surfacing of material” would reveal “HMG’s hand”, Dunlop wrote. These sensitivities guaranteed MI6’s involvement in the IRD operations, which were planned in collaboration with Britain’s spies. A secret memorandum reveals how the IRD and MI6 proposed to collaborate. Joy asked Britain’s spies to provide secret intelligence on the PCI leaders, their relations with Moscow and Soviet funding, and which media outlets were most used by swing voters. Others show a longstanding agent handled by MI6’s Swiss station chief, Terry O’Bryan-Tear, recruited rightwing Swiss politician Franco Masoni to print anti-Communist material in the Gazzetta Ticinese. Masoni offered to circulate 60,000 copies across the Swiss border, giving IRD a covert media outlet in Italy. O’Bryan-Tear’s “agent” also agreed to print a booklet showing how Communists exploited the democratic process of Czechoslovakia to seize power in 1948. The British operation could not have been more sensitive. A few months earlier, the CIA’s funding of Italian political parties had been revealed in the US press. David Lipsey, then Crosland’s political adviser, warned Britain “could hardly expect the [communist party] to play to democratic rules if we resorted to dirty tricks”. “If we give the communists enough rope, they may prove themselves innocent; or they may hang themselves.” A “lynching operation” threatened to damage “our democratic credibility … not theirs”, he wrote. “This was potentially incendiary with the British Labour party,” David, now Lord, Lipsey, told the Observer. “Here was this party, putting forward its credentials to be a democratic socialist party opposing a right-wing Italian government.” Going against it “would be like backing the US in Vietnam. I don’t think we would have minded if we thought … they [the PCI] were just Moscow’s tools in Italy.” Just over a month before the election, at a meeting to discuss Foreign Office “options for action” in Italy, Palliser and senior colleagues failed to convince Crosland to accept their recommendations, and no decision was made one way or the other. Lipsey advised the IRD’s head, Whitney, not to send the department’s paper on the PCI outside the diplomatic service. The following day, Crosland met his ministerial colleagues and agreed that Britain should issue “no public statements or private warnings to affect the election result”. Nevertheless, IRD operations in Italy went ahead, seemingly circumventing Crosland’s apparent reluctance. An internal IRD minute dated 3 June 1976 reveals that at a meeting held by Richard Sykes, then deputy undersecretary for Europe at the Foreign Office, it was agreed that “continuing unattributable information activity” did not require “ministerial sanction”. Lipsey said: “Nobody could think that that shouldn’t have been brought to [Crosland’s] attention”. IRD “should be working to the instructions of the foreign secretary of the day”. He is convinced Crosland did not give “the go-ahead for a campaign of this kind”. David, now Lord, Owen, who succeeded Crosland as foreign secretary in 1977, told the Observer: “Needless to say, democratic politicians should not interfere clandestinely in other democracies holding elections.” The IRD paper on the PCI was distributed for “interested contacts” at the “discretion” of each embassy. The Rome embassy issued a bulletin of UK press comment on the election slanted against the PCI. From Rome, Dunlop sent Joy suggestions for articles, including comparing the PCI’s surge to the rise of Benito Mussolini. Joy sent covert press contacts anti-communist articles written by the IRD, highlighting the insincerity of Berlinguer and the communists, and other anti-communist themes. Following an article by the former Labour minister Lord Chalfont in the Times about the communist threat to democracy and how their victory would lead to Italy’s expulsion from Nato, Dunlop called for another article to refute “arguments adduced by the PCI”. In an interview two days later, Lord Chalfont rebutted the PCI arguments using lines provided by Joy. Dunlop reported that the IRD paper on the PCI had been passed “to the Christian Democrat party, which intends some of it for circulation to candidates before the elections”. A week before the election, two forged pamphlets purporting to have been issued by Soviet news agency Novosti were circulated. Dunlop reported that they appeared to be “evidence of Soviet attempted manipulation of the elections” and “probably contributed to some degree to strengthening the vote for the Christian Democrats”. Although the origin of the forgeries is unclear, the IRD had previously produced at least 11 Novosti forgeries. Joy said they were “clearly very successful and provide important lessons for the future”. On election day, there was a swing to the left, but the Christian Democrats emerged as the largest party. Dunlop, reporting afterwards, identified the key development as “a largely spontaneous and effective campaign” by the Italian press, alerting Italians “to the dangers of voting the PCI into power”. The IRD’s operations against the PCI were, she wrote, “last minute” and “could only have had a limited impact”. Joy said the elections had “won us a short breathing space in which to prepare for the second round in Italy”. But the secret operation was the last major “black job” mounted by the IRD and its SEU: the following year, the new foreign secretary, David Owen, shut down the IRD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/01/chinas-president-xi-battles-to-save-face-as-covid-u-turn-weakens-his-grip-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-01T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"China’s President Xi battles to save face as Covid U-turn weakens his grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/chinas-president-xi-battles-to-save-face-as-covid-u-turn-weakens-his-grip-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/01/chinas-president-xi-battles-to-save-face-as-covid-u-turn-weakens-his-grip-on-power","fields":{"bodyText":"China’s leader Xi Jinping told his country it stands on “the right side of history” in a new year address on Saturday, but experts have warned that the president starts 2023 diminished by his chaotic U-turn on Covid strategy. He may struggle to deflect blame for the human and economic costs of zero-Covid’s failure, and control the national narrative, even if public signs of dissent are crushed. Officially, China has registered just over 5,200 deaths from Covid, but there is a yawning gap between the picture presented by the usually efficient communist propaganda apparatus and the reality reflected in social media posts and anecdotes from across China. Hospital emergency wards are overflowing with desperate patients. Medical supplies are running low, with pharmacies selling out of drugs ranging from anti-viral to basic painkillers. Police patrolled one Beijing crematorium where Reuters reported long queues of hearses last week. In his first public comments to the Chinese people on Covid since his government changed course three weeks ago, Xi used his speech on Saturday to claim the government and Chinese Communist party (CCP) had “put the people first and put life first all along”. For many in China, that phrase will ring hollow, particularly those fighting for medical care for loved ones newly struck down by the disease. Questions about why the country clung so long to zero-Covid, at such heavy cost, and did so little to prepare for opening up are likely to undermine Xi, even if the damage to his authority isn’t visible beyond the walls of the secretive leadership compounds. “The fact that the CCP’s posture towards the pandemic has now completely reversed after a popular uprising can only mar Xi Jinping’s carefully cultivated air of infallibility,” said Orville Schell, director of the centre on US-China relations at the Asia Society in New York. “Xi is virtually immune from public expressions of criticism within China,” he added. “But my Chinese friends are all shaking their heads in incredulity at the contrariness of Xi’s policies.” Foreign analysts, scouring the internet and official pronouncements for clues, estimate there are already thousands of deaths a day, with more to come. A first wave in urban areas is expected to peak in January, but a second, bigger wave will race through rural areas – where health systems are even weaker – in February and peak in early March, according to British health analytics firm Airfinity. There may also be an economic cost to giving Covid free rein. Some analysts said they expect a small exodus of elites, alongside renewed efforts to move money out of the country. That could heap further pressure on a quickly decelerating economy. Xi previously linked his personal prestige to draconian Covid-zero policies, vowing to stick with the harsh strictures as he cemented his personal authority and claimed a third term in power at a key Communist party summit in October. But by November the country was roiled by mass public demonstrations against the controls. Thousands defied heavy penalties for political activity in a surveillance state to join the most widespread protests China had seen in decades. In their wake, Beijing abruptly shifted course, abandoning controls almost overnight. Since then, spiralling deaths have caused alarm beyond China, particularly over fears that a huge number of new cases could create conditions for the emergence of a dangerous new variant. The World Health Organization has urged more transparency from Beijing, requesting more data on genetic sequencing, hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths and on vaccinations delivered and vaccination status. Britain last week joined other countries, including the US Japan and Italy, in requiring negative Covid tests for passengers flying in from China. Authorities have cited the lack of reliable data from China, although many experts have criticised the controls as kneejerk responses aimed more at assuaging public opinion than protecting public health. “The de facto abandonment of the zero-Covid policy without preparation is now a political mission of the Communist party and therefore of the Chinese government,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. “This being the case, statistics will need to be ‘patriotic’ and must uphold the official line.” The official position may meet with as much scepticism domestically as it does overseas. But there is little chance of a challenge to Xi, after he removed potential challengers and packed the top of the party with allies at the October meeting. “There are dissenting views within the government, such as on the best timing for opening up and the best preparation the government could have made. But they are silenced effectively,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. In a sign that his authority remains absolute even in the midst of his government’s struggles to contain the pandemic, Xi presided over a two-day meeting last week at which every politburo member was made to publicly self-examine their inadequacies over the past year. Xi has also turned to a time-honoured tradition within Chinese leadership, which pre-dates communist rule, blaming problems on failures in local government implementation, rather than central government policy. Xi’s call for more central leadership “seems to attribute blame to the local governments for inertia and generally failing to observe Beijing’s directives”, said Wen-Ti Sung, a lecturer at Australia National University’s Centre on China in the World. For years, the government defended the costs of the zero-Covid policy on the grounds that it saved Chinese lives. They could point for validation to the terrible suffering in countries like the UK where the pandemic raged out of control, and argue convincingly that Beijing was doing a better job than most other governments. That helped temper popular anger in the earliest days of the pandemic, when Wuhan was overwhelmed, many people died and China launched the global experiment with lockdowns. “People would like to believe the propaganda narrative, but when they see real things happening in their own circles, particularly relatives and family members, they will have less faith in the Chinese government,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. “Because people can see family members suffering and passing away, government cannot use propaganda to divert attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/dec/23/us-winter-storm-bomb-cyclone-snow-freezing-temperatures-wind-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T22:03:31Z","webTitle":"Heavy snow and frigid winds leaves millions without power across the US – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/dec/23/us-winter-storm-bomb-cyclone-snow-freezing-temperatures-wind-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/dec/23/us-winter-storm-bomb-cyclone-snow-freezing-temperatures-wind-latest-updates","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s slightly past 5pm in New York.

In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/oct/07/biden-warns-world-would-face-armageddon-if-putin-uses-a-tactical-nuclear-weapon-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T02:08:41Z","webTitle":"Biden warns world would face ‘Armageddon’ if Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/biden-warns-world-would-face-armageddon-if-putin-uses-a-tactical-nuclear-weapon-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/biden-warns-world-would-face-armageddon-if-putin-uses-a-tactical-nuclear-weapon-in-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden has warned the world could face “Armageddon” if Vladimir Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon to try to win the war in Ukraine. The US president made his most outspoken remarks to date about the threat of nuclear war, at a Democratic fundraiser in New York, saying it was the closest the world had come to nuclear catastrophe for sixty years. “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,” he said. “We’ve got a guy I know fairly well,” Biden said, referring to the Russian president. “He’s not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.” Putin and his officials have repeatedly threatened to use Russia’s nuclear arsenal in an effort to deter the US and its allies from supporting Ukraine and helping it resist the all-out Russian invasion launched in February. One fear is that he could use a short range “tactical” nuclear weapon to try to stop Ukraine’s counter-offensive in its tracks and force Kyiv to negotiate and cede territory. If Russia did use a nuclear weapon, it would leave the US and its allies with the dilemma of how to respond, with most experts and former officials predicting that if Washington struck back militarily, it would most likely be with conventional weapons, to try to avert rapid escalation to an all-out nuclear war. But Biden said on Thursday night: “I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.” “First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have the threat of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” the president said. “We are trying to figure out what is Putin’s off-ramp? Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself where he does not only lose face but significant power?” US intelligence agencies believe that Putin has come to see defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, which he associates with an existential threat to Russia, potentially justifying, according to his worldview, the use of nuclear weapons. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Putin understood that the “world will never forgive” a Russian nuclear strike. “He understands that after the use of nuclear weapons he would be unable any more to preserve, so to speak, his life, and I’m confident of that,” Zelenskiy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/03/right-to-be-scared-brittany-higgins-and-the-harsh-realities-about-justice-and-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T14:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘Right to be scared’: Brittany Higgins and the harsh realities about justice and power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/03/right-to-be-scared-brittany-higgins-and-the-harsh-realities-about-justice-and-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/03/right-to-be-scared-brittany-higgins-and-the-harsh-realities-about-justice-and-power","fields":{"bodyText":"On the third day of the trial of Bruce Lehrmann, Brittany Higgins wept. In full view of a packed courtroom, Higgins was watching the last recorded moments before she was allegedly raped on a couch in the office of the defence industry minister at the time, Linda Reynolds. The CCTV system at one of parliament’s many checkpoints showed a young woman, intoxicated, struggling to put her shoes back on after passing through the security gate about 1.30am on 23 March 2019. On the screen, Higgins appeared to offer an almost apologetic smile, seemingly embarrassed for the delay she was causing as Lehrmann, a fellow political staffer, waited ahead of her. The camera appears to capture a hint of what her friends and family say they all remembered of Higgins from that time – a young woman full of life who, having found herself in the heart of the nation’s power at just 25, now had the world at her feet. In the witness box, the contrast was stark. Higgins, in obvious distress, fought back tears as she watched those fleeting moments, which were played to the ACT supreme court over and over again. On Friday, as he announced he would not seek a retrial of Lehrmann, who has consistently maintained his innocence, the director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, gave some insight into what Higgins had faced throughout the justice process. “During the investigation and trial, as a sexual assault complainant, Ms Higgins has faced a level of personal attack that I have not seen in over 20 years of doing this work,” he said. “She’s done so with bravery, grace and dignity, and it is my hope that this will now stop.” The strain was such that independent medical evidence suggested there was a “significant and unacceptable risk to the life of the complainant” if a second trial was pursued. “While the pursuit of justice is essential for my office and for the community in general, the safety of a complainant in a sexual assault matter must be paramount.” The decision means Lehrmann, who pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, retains the presumption of innocence. With no prospect of a retrial, he remains innocent of any alleged rape of Higgins. On Friday Higgins was in hospital, receiving treatment and support. Her close friend Emma Webster said Higgins had faced a “difficult and unrelenting” two years. “While it’s disappointing the trial has ended this way, Brittany’s health and safety must always come first,” she said. Suppression orders were also lifted allowing media to report that Higgins had suffered a mental health crisis during her evidence, prompting a lengthy absence while she received treatment. Lehrmann is understood to be taking some time to process the latest developments. He has not made an official statement, but a friend told the Guardian he would be seeking advice on “legal remedies” in coming days. Unique insight into power The proximity to power of Higgins’ allegation guaranteed the trial would garner attention. In the words of the trial judge, Lucy McCallum, journalists were “practically hanging off the rafters” in the public gallery. While the nation was transfixed on the Lehrmann case, three unrelated trials were running in neighbouring courtrooms of the ACT supreme court. All involved sexual offences against women. In one, a young woman was found to have been sexually assaulted in a local nightclub. In another, a sex worker was found to have been raped at her workplace in the industrial suburb of Mitchell. Another man faced court next door to plead guilty to raping a sex worker after robbing her at knifepoint in a Canberra unit. Such cases now account for the bulk of the workload for local prosecutors. The ACT’s chief crown prosecutor, Anthony Williamson SC, told the Guardian that more and more cases were now proceeding to trial, a factor his office attributes to recent royal commissions and inquiries examining law enforcement’s handling of sexual crimes. “On average, about 60% of the trials listed in the ACT during a criminal trial listing period involved allegations of sexual offending,” he said. The Lehrmann case, with its high public profile, has made two things clear. It has clearly shown the impact the justice system can have on complainants. It has also provided – perhaps more than any other trial in recent memory – a window into how powerful institutions react when confronted with such allegations. It gave insight into the experience of those who challenge them – like the young woman captured on parliament’s CCTV system – who say they are chewed up and spat out in the process. The court had heard that Higgins felt she faced an invidious choice, something Drumgold had told the jury was a “fork in the road”. She said she could make a complaint, risk catastrophic media coverage for her minister and party in the lead-up to an election and put her career in jeopardy. Or she could stay silent, compartmentalise her trauma and carry on as if everything was fine, the court heard. Drumgold spoke of the “strong political forces” swirling around her as she considered her options. “We say she was right to be scared,” he told the jury in his closing submissions. Lehrmann’s defence said there was no evidence of any political forces working to suppress the complaint. It suggested Higgins had fabricated the allegations, fearing she would lose her job after being discovered naked in the minister’s office, and highlighted inconsistencies and flaws in her evidence. But Higgins said she was put under pressure from the start, during early meetings with her superiors, including one with Reynolds and her chief of staff, Fiona Brown, in the office where Higgins’ alleged rape occurred. “My interpretation of that was that if I raised it with police, there were going to be problems and they wanted to be involved or informed,” she told the court. “But just by having the meeting in the room, it all seemed really off and my interpretation of that was a bit of a scare tactic or an intimidation tactic, whether it was intentional or not.” Drumgold asked: “And what problems did you – was it your perception that they were communicating to you?” Higgins: “That this could theoretically be perceived in the broader public sense as a political problem for the Liberal party with women.” Both Brown and Reynolds denied putting any pressure on Higgins not to pursue the complaint. They also disputed the timing Higgins gave of when they were made aware of her rape. In the background, after an initial discussion with Higgins on 1 April 2019, police were preparing for a potential investigation. One of their first actions was to attempt to obtain CCTV recordings from Parliament House. They say they met resistance. The government refused to hand over the vision until a formal complaint had been made. Police were forced to make requests every six months to ensure that the footage was not wiped. Higgins, meanwhile, was disclosing her allegation that she had been raped to colleagues, friends and family. Prosecutors told the court she gave a consistent and unfaltering account of what she said had happened. The defence said she began complaining only after she realised her job was on the line. Even then, she said, the politics at play gave her pause during her conversations, including to those she deemed close, such as Ben Dillaway. The pair had dated and continued to speak often, including during the day after her alleged rape. But he was also a Liberal staffer, she said, with connections to the office of Scott Morrison. “I didn’t entirely trust him, that it wouldn’t get back to one of his best friends, which is Julian Leembruggen, who was in the prime minister’s office,” she said. The court heard Dillaway, concerned at Higgins’ mental state, eventually sought out Leembruggen, 11 days after the alleged rape. Leembruggen was not called to give evidence. ‘Systemic culture’ When Higgins decided to speak to the media, she said she did so for one reason. “[It] was about this culture, the systemic culture in Parliament House that was so rife, is so rife and continues to be rife,” she told the court. There are a dozen stories like mine.” Drumgold asked: “So you wanted to bring out the issues of behaviour in Parliament House?” Higgins: “And how they keep these sorts of things silent. That’s what I really was fundamentally going to the media for.” In that vein, Higgins said she had to record conversations with two powerful people within Parliament House – her new minister, Michaelia Cash, and Cash’s chief of staff, Daniel Try, to try to prove they knew about the allegation as early as October 2019. Both have disputed any such knowledge. “I was trying to give [the recordings] to as many people as possible, to have them just so that they existed, because it’s my word against a cabinet minister’s and it’s – the disparity between those two powers is ridiculous,” she said. Higgins resigned in early 2021 and decided to reinstate her complaint with police. Even then, having removed herself from Parliament House, she said she was still terrified about whether political figures would be able to access details of her complaint. This, Higgins said, caused her to take a cautious approach to dealing with police, including wiping material from her phone before handing it over. “I was pretty terrified on the basis that that week I found out the moment I had re-engaged with police … that politically sensitive matters that are within the remit of police gets reported to the home affairs minister,” she said. “Peter Dutton [the home affairs minister at the time] came out and said that he had the baseline information of my complaint before I even gave an evidence-in-chief interview. “I know how information flows within the ministerial wing … I was very, very scared.” In his closing address, Drumgold said the trial had made it “abundantly clear” that the political forces swirling around Higgins were still at play, more than three years after that night at Parliament House. Reynolds, the court heard, had been texting the defence barrister for Lehrmann, Steven Whybrow, asking him for transcripts and pointing him towards texts between Higgins and another of her former staffers that she said would be revealing. Reynolds denied allegations she was “politically invested” in the outcome and was trying to inject herself into proceedings, that she had discussed the evidence with her partner, or that she was attempting to “coach” the defence during their cross-examination of Higgins. Cash also denied political motives while claiming she had no knowledge of the rape complaint in October 2019. “Absolutely not ... I don’t know how it could be politically embarrassing,” she said. Well before the events of Friday, Higgins had told the court that she had wanted to avoid the kind of media attention that had been attached to her trial. “I didn’t want it to turn into a media frenzy,” she said, speaking of her caution in dealing with police in 2019. “I didn’t want it to turn into this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:02:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Zaporizhzhia attacks ‘playing with fire’, UN warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","fields":{"bodyText":"As the time approaches 8pm in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, here is the summary of today’s news from the war. Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But its boss, Rafael Grossi, said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom had earlier accused Ukraine of shelling at the plant, which is under Russian occupation. Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops Moscow has said the videos, which are circulating on social media, show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but it was “very unlikely” that the clips showed what Russia claims. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday said 47 places have been discovered where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainian. They include in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. That’s all for today, thanks for following along. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Sébastien Lecornu told the Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that Paris was considering a request for radars. According to the minister, since the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, France has provided Ukraine with €550m of military aid and is among the five largest donor countries to the war effort. The French military have also trained Ukrainian soldiers. “Our task is to train 2,000 people out of the 15,000 proposed by the European Union. Some 400 Ukrainian military personnel have already been trained on operating equipment and weapons systems that we are providing to Ukraine,” Lecornu said, Ukrinform reports. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights has denied that Kyiv’s forces have killed Russian prisoners of war, claiming that Ukraine’s soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. Videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian service personnel killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops, Agency France-Presse (AFP) reports. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture … committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, Lubinets argued. “Those who want to use the protection of international law to kill must be punished,” he added. AFP has not independently confirmed the videos. The Russian defence ministry said on Friday the videos showed the “deliberate and methodical murder of more than 10 restrained Russian soldiers”. It called for an investigation into “war crimes”. A United Nations spokesperson told AFP on Friday it was “aware of the videos” and “looking into them”. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. Anton Gerashchenko, a government adviser and former minister, said people were crying when they went back into the store for the first time. The supermarket opened a phone-charging service because of continuing issues with the city’s electricity supply. About 5 million people have lost their jobs in Ukraine owing to Russia’s invasion, according to Ukraine’s deputy economy minister. Tetyana Berezhna said fighting continued in the regions where 10 million people were once employed. She said the war, which led 7 million people to flee, had “significantly” affected the unemployment rate. “The war is destroying the Ukrainian labour market,” she said, according to the Kyiv Independent. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday morning said investigators had launched 44,662 proceedings. It added that to date, 47 places where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainian citizens had been discovered in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. Investigators from the national police had inspected specified places of imprisonment and torture, it added. Here’s a short summary of key events so far during day 270 of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But Rafael Grossi said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops Moscow has said the videos, which are circulating on social media, show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender.

Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. The Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant says Russian forces were behind Saturday night and Sunday morning’s shelling, contradicting Moscow’s claim that the attack came from Ukraine. The nuclear energy company Energoatom said there had been at least 12 hits on the plant’s infrastructure facilities, Reuters reports. The company posted on Telegram that the list of damaged equipment indicated that the attackers “targeted and disabled exactly the infrastructure that was necessary for the restart of 5th and 6th power units” and the restoration of power production for the country’s needs. AP reports that Ukraine is saying it will investigate controversial video footage circulating on social media that Moscow claims shows Ukrainian forces killing Russian troops while they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister in charge of the country’s push to join the European Union, told the agency: “Of course Ukrainian authorities will investigate this video.” Speaking at a security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she said it was “very unlikely” that the short clips show what Moscow claims. Russia said on Friday it had opened a criminal investigation based on the clips circulating on Russian social media, and its foreign ministry claims the footage shows an “execution”. Russia wants an international investigation but Stefanishyna said Ukrainian forces were “absolutely not interested in the execution of anybody” and were under direct orders to take “as many prisoners of war as we can” so they could be swapped in prisoner exchanges with Russia. The UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has called for further investigation, which Stefanishyna said Ukraine had “no problem” with. Ukraine’s defence ministry has shared a daily update on Russian losses, reporting that 330 more soldiers were “eliminated” in the last 24 hours. The total number of Russian soldiers killed during the invasion now stands at 84,210, according to the ministry. Nearly 3,000 tanks have been destroyed since February, it said. The figures, yet to be independently verified, were posted alongside a quote from the American author Helen Keller. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has condemned an attack on the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Its director general said that those responsible for “powerful explosions” in the area on Saturday night and Sunday morning were “playing with fire”. Managers told IAEA experts at the plant there had been damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none of them so far” critical for safety and security. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the IAEA said: “The news from our team yesterday and this morning is extremely disturbing. Explosions occurred at the site of this major nuclear power plant, which is completely unacceptable. “Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire!” Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is being shelled, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Reuters reports. It added that “Ukraine-fired” shells had landed near a dry storage site and no radioactive emissions were being detected. Renat Karchaa, an adviser from the Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, said 15 shells were fired at the plant’s facilities, according to Tass. The plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear station, has been under Russian occupation since March but continues to be operated by Ukrainian staff. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for previous shelling at the site that has caused damage to buildings and threatened a nuclear accident. Prior to Russia’s invasion, the facility provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. It has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times since being occupied by Russian forces. Russia has reached agreement with Iran to begin manufacturing hundreds of unmanned weaponised aircraft on Russian soil, the Washington Post reports. Citing intelligence seen by US and other western security agencies, the newspaper said officials from Moscow and Tehran finalised the deal during a meeting in Iran earlier this month. Russia and Iran are moving rapidly to transfer designs and key components that could allow production to begin within months, three officials familiar with the matter are reported to have said. Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment from the Post. As what is expected to be Ukraine’s toughest winter begins, much of its energy system has been crippled by targeted Russian strikes. It means that in recently liberated Kherson, those who live in houses have started to gather wood to burn. But Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens that Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells in the woods. At the same time, those living in flats with old Soviet centralised heating systems have even fewer options. In their latest dispatch from the city, my colleagues Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw speak to residents facing more devastation after eight months of occupation. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence update on the war in Ukraine. It says that Russia’s withdrawal from the Ukrainian port city of Kherson was “conducted in relatively good order” compared with previous major retreats from occupied areas. It is likely Russia lost only tens, rather than hundreds, of vehicles during the retreat. Meanwhile, it “successfully” destroyed most of the kit that was left behind to prevent it from falling into Ukrainian hands. This apparent improvement is likely due to a “more effective” single operational command under Gen Sergei Surovikin, the update says. Surovikin was appointed by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as overall commander of Russia’s “special military operation” in October. A key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has told the AFP news agency that the west’s attempts to persuade Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow, after a series of major military victories by Kyiv, are “bizarre” and amount to asking for capitulation. “When you have the initiative on the battlefield, it’s slightly bizarre to receive proposals like: ‘you will not be able to do everything by military means anyway, you need to negotiate,” said Mykhaylo Podolyak. US media recently reported that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks, which Zelenskiy has so far rejected without a prior withdrawal of Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory. According to Podolyak, Moscow has not made “any direct proposal” to Kyiv for peace talks, preferring to transmit them through intermediaries and even raising the possibility of a ceasefire. Kyiv sees such talk as mere manoeuvring by the Kremlin to win some respite on the ground and prepare a new offensive. New Zealand said on Sunday that its defence minister, Peeni Henare, had visited Kyiv to reaffirm support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invasion. “We discussed New Zealand’s recent extension of the infantry training support mission in the UK for Ukrainian troops out to July 2023,” Henare said in a statement after holding bilateral talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov. New Zealand last week said it would send a further 66 defence personnel to Britain to help train Ukrainian soldiers. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a brief look at the latest developments as it approaches 9.15am in Kyiv. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Five people were injured in a Russian strike on a humanitarian station in southern Ukraine, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Around 60 Russian soldiers were killed this week in a long-range Ukrainian artillery attack on their positions in the town of Mykhailkva, 40km to the south of Kherson, Ukraine’s military said on Saturday. Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday to meet Zelenskiy – Sunak’s first visit to the country since taking office. Sunak announced that Britain will provide a £50m air defence package for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Ukrainian electricity supplies are under control despite Russian attacks on power-generating infrastructure and there is no need to panic, the energy ministry said a day after the government stated that almost half of Ukraine’s energy system had been crippled, and authorities in Kyiv warned that the capital could face a “complete shutdown” of the power grid as winter sets in. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the supply problems were worst in and around Kyiv as well as in six other regions. “We are working throughout the country to stabilise the situation,” he said in a video address. Ukrainian forces could be in Crimea by the end of December, the country’s deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has said. Jubilant Ukrainians rolled into Kherson by train for the first time in more than eight months as residents of the newly liberated southern city greeted them on the platform with flowers and national flags. Citing damage done by Russian forces, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced evacuations of people who want to leave Kherson and the surrounding areas would soon begin. The funeral took place on Saturday of a Polish man who was one of two victims killed when a missile crashed into a grain storage facility in the Polish village of Przewodow. Asia-Pacific leaders added their voices on Saturday to international pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, issuing a summit statement saying “most” of them condemned the war. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin said China and Russia were seeking a world where force is used to resolve disputes and he vowed the United States would continue to defend humanitarian principles and international law. Peace in Ukraine will only be possible if the country’s 1991 borders are restored, a senior aide to Zelenskiy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/16/chinas-sound-and-fury-over-aukus-will-mean-little-for-ties-with-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T21:34:19Z","webTitle":"China’s sound and fury over Aukus will mean little for ties with Australia | Benjamin Herscovitch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/chinas-sound-and-fury-over-aukus-will-mean-little-for-ties-with-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/chinas-sound-and-fury-over-aukus-will-mean-little-for-ties-with-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"Leaving aside the former prime minister Paul Keating’s anti-Aukus spray at the National Press Club on Wednesday, perhaps the strongest criticism about this week’s trilateral submarine deal between Australia, the US and the UK has come from Beijing. Rehearsing now-familiar talking points, the Chinese government on Tuesday decried Aukus as an example of a “typical cold war mentality” and a threat to both “regional peace and stability” and the “international nuclear non-proliferation regime”. This stream of Chinese government objections is likely to grow to a flood as Aukus takes shape. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Yet this rhetorical sound and fury signifies little for Australia-China ties. Although Beijing will continue to oppose Aukus, China is unlikely to reverse the bilateral relationship repair of recent months. Canberra’s decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines was priced into Australia-China ties long before the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his US and UK counterparts took to the podium in San Diego this week. Beijing started courting Canberra with softer messaging as early as December 2021 – mere months after the news of Aukus broke in September that year. China’s shift to softer diplomacy towards Australia became more pronounced in the first half of 2022, culminating in a series of increasingly warm engagements between Australian and Chinese ministers and leaders from June 2022 onwards. The Chinese government has been keen to re-engage with Canberra knowing full well that Australia had embraced Aukus on a bipartisan basis. China is now also letting previously excluded Australian exports into its market, including what were once multibillion-dollar coal exports. As with Aukus, Beijing has blinked on a wide range of other complaints against Canberra. Australia continues its efforts to minimise China’s security role in the Pacific, maintain Australian military presence in the disputed South China Sea, and incrementally restrict market access for Chinese technology companies. Neither these nor many other areas of dispute have stopped Beijing from repairing ties with Canberra. China has decided that it wants to get the relationship with Australia “back on the right track” regardless of these and other enduring points of deep disagreement. Joint Aukus press conferences and submarine capability details are therefore unlikely to prompt Beijing to put Canberra back in the diplomatic and trade freezer. Notwithstanding China’s harsh anti-Aukus rhetoric, Australia will probably be able to steam ahead with its nuclear-powered submarine plan without upsetting the overall positive trajectory of the bilateral relationship. Of course, this does not mean that China will abandon its opposition to Aukus. Since Aukus was revealed, the Chinese government has made clear its deep suspicion of Australia’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. Beijing’s hostility towards Aukus is unsurprising, especially given China’s goals of eventually taking Taiwan and building a “world-class military” capable of prevailing in military contingencies in its near-region and beyond. Unlike Australia’s previously planned diesel-electric submarines, the Aukus boats will be able to project power far into north Asia for extended periods. This does not mean that Australia would be locked into supporting US forces in the event of a military clash with China to defend Taiwan. But Beijing understands that these new submarines will eventually give Australian governments the option of contributing significant additional forces to US-led military actions as far afield as the Taiwan Strait and the East China Sea. To be sure, China would still prefer to annex Taiwan without fighting. As Avril Haines, US director of national intelligence, told the House Intelligence Committee last week: “It’s not our assessment that China wants to go to war.” But Beijing aims to ensure that, if necessary, it has the capability to prevail in military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait and surrounds. If Australia chooses to deploy its nuclear-powered submarines in support of a US-led effort to defend Taiwan, then Aukus will have made China’s military goals harder to achieve. With Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines potentially impinging on China’s pursuit of what it considers to be its “core interests” in Taiwan, Beijing will ramp up its efforts to discredit Aukus. The Chinese government will seek to stoke fears about nuclear proliferation and spread questionable claims that Australia and its Aukus partners have abrogated their international legal obligations. Yet Aukus adds just one extra item to the already long list of China’s complaints against Australia. These include everything from Australia’s cautious approach to approving Chinese investments to Canberra’s forceful and public criticisms of the Chinese government’s systematic human rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Like these other points of bilateral tension, the latest Aukus announcements are unlikely to prompt Beijing to rethink its decision to re-engage with Canberra. So, to paraphrase Keating, China’s criticisms of Aukus are likely to be all tip and no iceberg when it comes to the broader Australia-China relationship. • Dr Benjamin Herscovitch is a research fellow at Australian National University and author of Beijing to Canberra and Back, a newsletter chronicling Australia-China relations"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/03/us-weather-latest-storms-midwest-north-east","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T21:21:18Z","webTitle":"Midwest and north-east US brace for powerful storm and possible tornadoes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/03/us-weather-latest-storms-midwest-north-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/03/us-weather-latest-storms-midwest-north-east","fields":{"bodyText":"A relatively powerful storm system headed east on Friday threatened the midwest and north-east US with heavy snow after spawning likely tornadoes in Texas and Louisiana which damaged homes, businesses, a university campus and left thousands without power. The Tennessee and Ohio valleys are bracing for high winds and potential tornadoes as the storms roll on toward New England, according to officials. Officials at Indiana Michigan Power said areas in south-western Michigan and northern Indiana saw rain (some of it frozen), sleet, snow and strong wind gusts on Friday. Meanwhile, Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, warned residents that there could be tornadoes and wind gusts of 55 to 65mph (88 to 104km/h) in the state after the forecasted rains move through. Officials in several school districts canceled classes in preparation. “The wind will really kick in after the storm moves through,” Beshear said on Friday. “I don’t want people to have confidence that it’s going to be safe.” Early Friday evening, Beshear said one person had died in Simpson county, Kentucky, as a result of the weather. No other details were immediately available. Though New England was mostly sunny on Friday morning, once the storm system swirls through, parts of New Hampshire and Maine could get as much as 18in (45cm) of snow and winds gusts as high as 40mph (64km/h). The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning from 10pm Friday until 7pm on Saturday and alerted New England to a mix of snow and sleet. Meanwhile, the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island could also see flooding. No deaths or injuries have been reported from the storms that struck Texas and Louisiana on Thursday night after leaving parts of California earlier in the week with as much as 7ft (2.1 meters) of snow. The weather service surveyed damage on Friday near Pickton, about 80 miles (130km) east of Dallas, where it confirmed a tornado struck, according to meteorologist Daniel Huckaby. In that area, winds of nearly 80mph (130km/h) were recorded near the Fort Worth suburb of Blue Mound. The roof of an apartment building in the suburb of Hurst was blown away, resident Michael Roberts told KDFW-TV. “The whole building started shaking,” Roberts said. “The whole ceiling is gone. It got really crazy.” Officials in Richardson, a Dallas suburb, asked residents to stop using water after the storm knocked out power to pumping stations. By Friday, electricity and water had been restored, but city officials said they were investigating why a backup system meant to provide power after widespread outages failed during the storm. Minor injuries were reported north of Dallas, where winds brought down trees, ripped the roof off a grocery store and overturned four 18-wheelers. Buildings at Louisiana State University Shreveport were damaged, and trees were toppled, school spokesperson Erin Smith said. But, after an overnight closure, the campus was reopening on Friday. More than 72,000 Texas customers and more than 42,000 in Louisiana were without electricity about midday on Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. There was flooding in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri as the result of heavy rain. Police in Hardy, Arkansas, about 115 miles (185km) north of Little Rock, asked residents along the Spring River to temporarily leave their homes because of flooding. Meanwhile, Oklahoma dealt with hail and strong winds. Parts of south-eastern Missouri were under a flash flood warning on Friday after heavy rain swelled streams and flooded low-lying highways with runoff, according to the state’s transportation department.

It was not just any pair of shoes, obviously. The website listing for Julien’s Auctions said: “The cork-and-jute footbed retains the imprint of Steve Jobs’ feet, which had been shaped after years of use.” “The sandals were part of his simple side,” Chrisann Brennan, Jobs’s former girlfriend and the mother of his child, told Vogue Germany in 2018. “They were his uniform.” Jobs is famous for having co-founded Apple in 1976, but it could be argued that he was just as well regarded for his strict approach to fashion. Black Issey Miyake turtleneck jumpers (Jobs was said to own more than 100 of them) worn with Levi’s 501 jeans plus New Balance trainers or Birkenstocks didn’t just form the cornerstone of his wardrobe, they were its entirety. Just as Vogue’s Anna Wintour has become instantly identifiable by her sharp bob haircut, and Kim Kardashian by her body shape, Jobs’s trademark was his uniform. It’s an approach that many successful people have since tried to emulate. The uniform of Karl Lagerfeld, the late creative director of Chanel, consisted of a starched white shirt, a black blazer and trousers and a pair of fingerless gloves. Both Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are known for their colourful trouser suits. Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is said to have honed her signature look of a black roll neck jumper (and red lipstick) after reading about Jobs’s approach while Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg opts for a grey T-shirt and jeans. “The great thing about a uniform is that you don’t have to give any thought to what to wear in the morning,” Brennan told Vogue Germany. “He would never have done or bought anything just to make himself stand out. He just believed in the intelligence and practicality of the design … And in Birkenstocks he didn’t feel like a businessman, so he had the freedom to be creative and think creatively.” It is this freedom of thought hypothesis that also appeals to people such as Zuckerberg. In 2014, at a Facebook public Q&amp;A session, he was asked why he wore the same T-shirt every day. Dressed in said grey T-shirt, he replied: “I’m in this really lucky position where I get to wake up every day and help serve more than a billion people. I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything, except how to best serve this community.” This idea of streamlining decision-making dates back to the 1800s. In his 1892 book Psychology: The Briefer Course, American philosopher William James wrote: “The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation.” In 1998 the social psychologist Roy F Baumeister coined the term “decision fatigue”. Based on Sigmund Freud’s theory of ego depletion, it essentially describes the way a person’s choices become poorer the more decisions they are forced to make. It’s estimated that the average adult makes 35,000 decisions every day. If you’ve ever stood in front of your wardrobe at 7am debating whether to wear trousers or jeans, or struggled to reply when a barista asks if you want a regular or medium latte, you’ll know that even little decisions can cause stress. Automating how you get dressed means saving energy to focus on more complex questions. Since the war in Ukraine started, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has swapped a statesmanlike shirt and tie for a green hoodie, cargo pants and sneakers. Even after accusations of being out of touch during the cost of living crisis, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, continues to appear in his signature £3,500 suits, with £450 loafers from Prada. His uniform is the norm among the one percenters he mingles with. It’s the same type of “quiet luxury” the hit TV series Succession brilliantly captured. Tom wears a logoed Moncler gilet while Kendall wears more inconspicuous brands such as Brunello Cucinelli. They probably cost more but aren’t instantly identifiable. This type of identity politics lies behind the Gen Z obsession with creating “starter packs’’ to share on social media. These are visual guides to the clothing, accessories and other items (oat milk, say) that capture the essence of a particular cohort. A “geography teacher” collection, for example, features beige corduroy trousers and a green cardigan while a “Rich Mom” set includes a pair of Lululemon leggings, a Birkin handbag and a green juice. The architecture world is another industry that has an almost implicit uniform. In an interview, Swiss architect Jacques Herzog said: “Everybody creates his or her own architecture, which then becomes part of the city. Clothes are a kind of link between the public and the private, just like a house.” Luke Matone, a London-based architect in his 30s, says a “baker’s jacket” and matching trousers from Universal Works are in the wardrobe of every architect he knows. “It’s smart but casual… It’s a way of wearing a suit without wearing an actual suit.” Uniforms make fertile ground for satirists. Through black-and-white cartoons he posts on Instagram, Welsh artist Bedwyr Williams regularly pokes fun at creative types and their unofficial uniforms. Carolyn Mair, a fashion psychologist, says uniform dressing isn’t lazy – in fact, it’s “cognitively smart”. As for how long it takes for others to notice a uniform, Mair says it depends how much someone exhibits themselves. “It’s easier for people in the public eye as we see images of them all the time. It’s a repetition effect: it’s all about exposure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2022/dec/10/few-in-the-media-grasped-the-power-of-keatings-redfern-speech-that-day-in-1992","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T14:00:37Z","webTitle":"Few in the media grasped the power of Keating’s Redfern speech that day in 1992 | Amanda Meade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/10/few-in-the-media-grasped-the-power-of-keatings-redfern-speech-that-day-in-1992","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/dec/10/few-in-the-media-grasped-the-power-of-keatings-redfern-speech-that-day-in-1992","fields":{"bodyText":"When Paul Keating stood up in Sydney’s Redfern Park in 1992 and said “we committed the murders; we took the children from their mothers”, the media did not entirely grasp the significance of his words. Only the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times ran the then-prime minister’s landmark Redfern speech on page one. The Australian newspaper relegated its report the next day to page four with the headline “PM blames whites for black malaise”. The Herald Sun ran it on page 11 with the headline “PM ‘a hero’ for blast on racism”. For a junior Herald reporter that day, it was to be an assignment where I truly got to write the “first rough draft of history”. Only I had no idea of that as I headed down to inner-city Redfern on the morning of 10 December 1992. There was no sense that a landmark event was about to happen as the press waited in the sun for Keating to start his 17-minute speech, written the night before by legendary speechwriter Don Watson. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It was a vastly different media landscape 30 years ago. Print was king and there were no digital newspapers, no social media, no 24-hour news channels. The Herald and the Age were owned by Fairfax and did not share copy. They had separate reports of the speech written by different reporters. The Canberra Times was owned by Kerry Stokes, the chairman of Seven West Media. It would be another four years before Sky News Australia was available on Foxtel and 18 until the ABC started up its rolling news channel. The Herald, still a broadsheet and funded by the rivers of gold from classified print advertising, only began to dabble in online news in 1995 when it launched Computers Online, an internet version of its weekly computer section. Apart from radio and nightly TV news bulletins, the news was delivered the next day when the newspapers hit the streets. Without social media, the news that a sitting prime minister had admitted it was the colonisers who “did the dispossessing” did not spread as fast as it might in today’s climate. Keating’s office had not backgrounded journalists about the contents of the speech. It was a Thursday when the 24th prime minister of Australia addressed the largely Aboriginal crowd at a community event to launch the international year of the world’s Indigenous peoples. The crowd, filled with local Aboriginal kids and their carers, was a little noisy when Keating began to speak but fell silent, eventually cheering when he reached the key points. “We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life,” Keating said. “We brought the diseases, the alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion.” Back in the Herald office, the news desk was briefed and they recognised it was the strongest statement ever made by an Australian leader about the dispossession of the Indigenous population and put the story on page one. The Australian followed up its first report on Friday with comprehensive coverage in the Weekend Australian and an editorial on Monday. In 2020 researchers who looked into 45 years of print coverage of Aboriginal initiatives for self-determination, were critical of the Australian’s coverage of the Redfern speech for referring to Indigenous people as “stoneagers” who could not survive “the age of discovery” unchanged. “The Australian argues that this [Redfern] statement really refers to the past, that contemporary Australians should not feel guilty,” they wrote.

In a speech to the UN general assembly, Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons. The new federal water minister has been forced into a tricky situation after a declaration from the New South Wales government set the stage for a water-saving showdown with other states. And Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack have said they are unsure if meetings they attended were of Scott Morrison’s secretive cabinet committee or not. Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons, with the US pledging to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s partial mobilisation. Appearing before the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called “reckless” threats and “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that his country had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. NSW will seek an exemption from its obligations to deliver the final stage of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, a move that could leave the environment short-changed millions of litres of water. NSW will not meet a June 2024 deadline to deliver the last 25% of water savings of the plan, to be achieved through water-saving projects. The declaration sets the stage for a showdown with the other basin states and poses a test for the new federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek. She must decide whether to give NSW the concessions it is seeking at the expense of the environment, or use the tough penalties that are built into the plan. Former deputy prime ministers Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack did not always know if the “deep dive” policy meetings they attended were actually meetings of Scott Morrison’s secretive cabinet subcommittee. McCormack said he was “definitely” a member of the cabinet office policy committee, but he was “not sure” if meetings attended by external stakeholders were cabinet office policy committee meetings. Joyce said there was “nothing distinctly different” about the meetings he attended compared with the processes of former Liberal prime ministers, but he knew them only as “deep dives”, not as policy committee meetings.

The final curtain on supporters’ unconditional love for a pouting superstar who as an unused replacement could not stomach sticking around to celebrate a scintillating win over Tottenham. It is also the death knell of this 37-year-old being of relevance – to Erik ten Hag and the United side he seeks to build – as underlined by the manager dropping him from the squad for Saturday’s game at Chelsea. The two are connected. Fans witnessed the finest display of their team in recent memory and saw a man who draws about £500,000 a week sulk because Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen and Anthony Elanga were preferred when Ten Hag made changes. They watched a footballer who enjoys unadulterated hero status due to his brilliance hurl it back in their faces by acting as if he can and should overshadow their club. More material is how performing a second stomp-out in less than three months underlines Ronaldo’s waning power. In July, at half- time during a friendly against Rayo Vallecano, Ten Hag had the temerity to replace a player who was not close to match fit after missing most of pre-season (because of a family issue). Ronaldo’s reaction was to depart Old Trafford before the final whistle in a first challenge to the new manager’s authority. This, too, was a squad member who at the start of the summer had sent out smoke signals that he wished to leave. Cut to Sunday and United’s show of class in honouring Ronaldo’s remarkable feat of 700 club goals with an on-pitch presentation from Sir Alex Ferguson, which was followed with a disgruntlement (by now hardly news) at being taken off during the goalless draw with Newcastle. Three days later, Ten Hag restored Marcus Rashford to the starting XI at Ronaldo’s expense. The 52-year-old, whose management blends people skills, intelligence, tactical acumen and a hard edge, was pithy in explaining why. Ronaldo’s legs were simply not up to the “good press” needed to combat the visitors. Cue Tottenham being smothered expertly as the tactical ploy worked a dream, with Fred and Bruno Fernandes goals handing United a handsome triumph. All without Ronaldo, whose eschewing by Ten Hag even as a substitute showed his retreat into further insignificance, having previously been a replacement only in the wins against Liverpool (2-1) and Arsenal (3-1). An equally damning Ten Hag verdict on Ronaldo’s import was found in the manager ignoring him when the team took a serious beating at Manchester City (6-3). Instead, Rashford and Jadon Sancho started while Anthony Martial was the cavalry Ten Hag sent for. It is hardly Ronaldo’s fault he is in the winter of a sparkling career. But what he could do is accept this while continuing to fight – in the correct way – for a starting berth. The next episode in the Ronaldo soap opera will be intriguing, though observing Ten Hag suggests the manager will play a shrewd hand. He may also have fined Ronaldo for Wednesday’s strop and there is the material question of how the teammates he deserted view this moody superstar. Respect may be evaporating – not for the talent, hard work, serial silverware, personal honours and the 817 career goals – but for a character who continues to suggest being the antithesis of the all-for-one spirit Ten Hag knows is vital to achieve success. The manager will be conscious Ronaldo can still be a potent weapon – predominantly from the bench – so expect him to offer calm dispatches at Friday’s media briefing when being quizzed on the affair, the player’s worth and his future. Any and all answers will be parsed for subtext because an inescapable truth is that the ideal scenario – for Ten Hag, his group and Ronaldo – would be for the player to leave as soon as possible –, which is in the January window. Few clubs are able to afford a player with Ronaldo’s salary, which was the prevailing reason why he did not depart in the summer. But if this same issue seems to remain regarding the winter market, it feels increasingly irrelevant as the side evolves. In exiting on Wednesday Ronaldo bolstered Ten Hag’s assessment that he is peripheral to United – there to be deployed when and if required but in no way a shoo-in for the XI on the grounds of former glories and a glittering CV. As a metaphor, too, for his second coming at United (after the 2003 to 2009 spell) Ronaldo striding off is apt: it points to the sense of him as a cipher, a garlanded perfectionist who, despite being one of the greats, remains unknowable, whose profile beyond the pitch is via image-conscious, choreographed social media posts, with the true persona fiercely guarded. On Thursday evening, Ronaldo issued a statement on Instagram that accepted responsibility but stopped short of an apology. “I’ve always tried to set the example myself for the youngsters that grew in all the teams that I’ve represented,” he wrote. “Unfortunately that’s not always possible and sometimes the heat of the moment get’s the best of us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","fields":{"bodyText":"Even for an executive in the eye of the gathering storm that is the energy crisis, Chris O’Shea seems remarkably busy. The chief executive of Centrica bustles on to our videocall from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, after battling traffic on his way from a hydrogen project in the Humber. Afterwards he’s off to the coast, to check progress on reopening the massive Rough undersea gas storage facility – a key part of ensuring the UK will be able to keep the lights on as Russia throttles gas supplies. He has also found time to watch Liz Truss announce her energy bills bailout on the TV. Her plan involves reworking power supply contracts, a measure O’Shea, along with other industry leaders, has been pushing for. Tomorrow brings an early morning trip to Brigg power station in north Lincolnshire, where the company is building a 50-megawatt battery storage plant. He’s not complaining, though. “Having to work two jobs to make ends meet, that’s a struggle,” says O’Shea, crunching on a bag of salt- and-vinegar crisps as he hurries his lunch. “It’s a massive privilege to be in the position I’m in.” *** CV Age 48 Family Married with three children. Education Accountancy degree, University of Glasgow; MBA, Duke University, North Carolina. Pay £875k last year (waived a £1.1m bonus). Last holiday Florida. Best advice he’s been given “You’ve two eyes, two ears and one mouth: try to use them in proportion.” Phrase he overuses “Do you have five minutes?” How he relaxes Spending time with friends and family; running. *** Centrica is the largest UK company supplying power into its home market, with 8 million domestic and retail customers. It owns British Gas, the former state monopoly, and is valued at more than £5bn. Its stock has risen more than 70% over the past year, thanks to surging gas prices, and half-year profits were a thumping £1.3bn. Its assets span gasfields in the North and Irish seas, solar projects and a stake in UK nuclear power. O’Shea shrugs off public anger that has seen him vilified for high pay (potentially £4.26m this year), for still working some of the time from home and for cutting jobs – he even had faeces sent to his home near Reading: “It would be very self-indulgent to feel sorry for myself. I’m in a very fortunate position.” Later, he adds: “My brother took his life when he was 25 – that is the toughest challenge I have overcome. A personal tragedy puts everything else into perspective.” O’Shea joined the British Gas owner as finance chief in 2018, moving to the top job in April 2020. Since then, he’s navigated Covid, slashed 5,000 jobs at the former state monopoly, and taken on 800,000 customers from suppliers put out of business by surging gas prices. Now, he’s in talks with government over a voluntary profits cap and is eyeing a push into more nuclear power. Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s ageing nuclear facilities through a joint venture with France’s EDF. Having flirted with selling that stake, the British firm dropped that plan last year. Despite pulling out of the project to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset with EDF a decade ago, Centrica has been linked with investing in its sister site in Suffolk, Sizewell C. O’Shea confirms this interest for the first time, saying he is seriously considering investing in the project. In one of his final acts as prime minister, Boris Johnson said that Britain was “putting up to £700m” into the project, which could cost £30bn to build. The government and EDF are understood to be finalising a deal that would see each take a 50% stake in a new vehicle while external investors are sought, pushing out China’s CGN in the process. “I’m very interested in understanding the terms of the agreement between EDF and the government,” says O’Shea. “If those terms are attractive, I would very much like to be involved in Sizewell C, but I need to see the terms and have a conversation, obviously, with my colleagues on the board. But it’s fully aligned with our strategy.” He says “some of our fears have come to pass in terms of cost overruns and delays” at Hinkley Point C, but backs EDF. “I’ve been in large capital projects myself. Things go wrong. But at good companies, when they go wrong, you learn from them.” O’Shea says he is “committed to delivering decarbonisation” by the government net zero target date of 2050 or earlier. He says: “The reality is, I believe in a decarbonised UK: that requires more wind power, more solar power, more nuclear power, and decarbonised gas.” He is even tempted by a project to build a fleet of mini nuclear plants in the UK. “I am interested in understanding a bit more about the small modular reactors that Rolls-Royce is developing. So that’s something that we would potentially look at as well.” A push into costly nuclear projects would be a bold new frontier for a self-confessed “disciplined” numbers man. Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, O’Shea studied accountancy in Glasgow, where he had moved after his parents’ business hit hard times. He has rattled through a series of finance roles with corporate big beasts including Ernst &amp; Young, Shell, BG Group and Smiths Group, and done stints in the US and Nigeria, where his uncle was once a priest. The Scotsman’s diverse wardrobe ranges from pinstripes to sloganed hoodies. Today it’s a blue shirt and a black blazer with coral-coloured chinos. A few sprigs of white run through his dark beard. He’s not too downcast after Celtic FC, whose matches he still watches with schoolmates, lost to Real Madrid. Not content just to be a spectator, he’s preparing to run the Berlin marathon this month. Despite Truss’s intervention, this winter remains uncertain for many. O’Shea urges customers to wait until they receive their bills before inundating call centres. He says Downing Street should be “applauded” for the support, adding: “This is a two-year temporary programme, and it gives us time to fix the underlying causes of the issue.” His solution is to voluntarily give the government a slice of the outsize profits Centrica has made from its nuclear stake and its North Sea gas operations, to pay for lower bills. He is in negotiations with civil servants now about how to do that. Isn’t this merely a strategy to avoid being slapped with a more punitive windfall tax? “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off,” he says. “It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” In one of her first acts as prime minister, Truss reopened the door to fracking. O’Shea welcomes the new policy, which will allow companies to drill – if they win approval from local residents. “It’s absolutely right: you should look at it because, again, it helps with energy security.” But would he oppose fracking near his own home? “If I was publicly in support of fracking, I couldn’t find it in my conscience to object.” • This article was amended on 11 &amp; 12 September: to correct details about O’Shea’s pay and to note that he was speaking from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, not Easington, County Durham as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"State-owned electricity generation firm ‘could save Britons nearly £21bn a year’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","fields":{"bodyText":"A publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year, according to new analysis that bolsters Labour’s case to launch a national energy company if the party gains power. Thinktank Common Wealth has calculated that the cost of generating electricity to power homes and businesses could be reduced by £20.8bn or £252 per household a year under state ownership, according to a report seen by the Guardian. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has committed to creating “a publicly owned national champion in clean energy” named Great British Energy. Starmer is yet to lay out the exact structure of the mooted company, although he has said it would not involve nationalising existing assets, or become involved in the transmission or retail supply of energy. Starmer instead hopes to create a state-backed entity that would invest in clean energy – wind, solar, tidal, nuclear and other emerging technologies – creating jobs and ensuring windfalls from the growth in low carbon power feed back to the government. The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. MPs and campaigners have argued that Britain’s energy companies should be nationalised since the energy crisis, which has resulted in North Sea oil and gas producers and electricity generators making windfall profits, and a string of retail suppliers collapsing, costing taxpayers billions. Detractors of nationalisation in energy argue it can stifle innovation and expose taxpayers to huge financial risks. Common Wealth pointed out that more than 40% of the UK’s offshore wind generation capacity was publicly owned by overseas national entities, meaning the benefits of high electricity prices linked to the war in Ukraine had flowed back to other governments. The study found the publicly owned generator model would create more savings than other options, including a drive for voluntary CfDs; splitting the generation market between low carbon and fossil fuel sources and a “single buyer model” with nationalised retail suppliers. The Common Wealth director, Mathew Lawrence, said: “The energy system faces two acute challenges: the staggering profits being made by generators, and the need to rapidly decarbonise generation. “A publicly owned generator can address both these pressing issues, rebuilding out energy system around the public interest. That is the fastest, fairest, most effective way to build a clean, secure, affordable power system.” Starmer has cited the success of European energy firms with state backing including Sweden’s Vattenfall and Ørsted, which is part owned by the Danish state. The authors of the Common Wealth report argued that Great British Energy could be a “powerful tool” in decarbonising Britain, but said ambition akin to the creation of the NHS was needed to make a serious difference. “An approach to reform that does not go to the root of the upstream problems in our energy system, that does not build out at scale and instead remains a marginal actor in the transition, will be unable to deliver on its potential or, in the case of Great British Energy, its stated goals. In this context, timidity and incrementalism are the greatest risks, and ambition the safest path forward,” they wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/sep/26/a-church-with-open-doors-the-ecstatic-power-of-pharoah-sanders","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-26T12:34:27Z","webTitle":"A church with open doors: the ecstatic power of Pharoah Sanders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/26/a-church-with-open-doors-the-ecstatic-power-of-pharoah-sanders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/sep/26/a-church-with-open-doors-the-ecstatic-power-of-pharoah-sanders","fields":{"bodyText":"John Coltrane, speaking to jazz musician Albert Ayler, once described himself, Pharoah Sanders and Ayler as “the father, the son and [the] holy ghost”. Sanders played sideman to Coltrane on many crucial recordings, and, like Coltrane, Sanders could cut it both ways: roll out a spiritual groove that landed like breakers on the shore, or splice the air itself into a trigonometry of fire and aether. He leant into a broadly multicultural spiritualism in his music, but could take flight in ferocious exaltations on his saxophone. His music spoke volumes, while he himself preferred not to, and is at the core of any spiritual jazz discography. As Ben Ratliff wrote in the New York Times in 1999, Sanders was “one of the holy monsters of American music”. With the passing of the son, the last member of Coltrane’s last band is gone, and a crucial connection to the potent and now legendary New York jazz scene of the 1960s and 70s is severed. Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Farrell Sanders began by playing a clarinet he bought from a recently deceased member of the congregation at his church for $17. He moved briefly to Oakland, California, then in 1962 hitch-hiked to New York without a plan. He arrived homeless, essentially, and took to donating blood to earn money to eat. He listened to jazz being played in the clubs from outside, lived off cheap pizza and worked odd jobs, sometimes sleeping in cinemas in the day. He was not alone in this deprivation – in a review of reissues in The Wire 343, music journalist Philip Clark reminds us that: “learning the vicissitudes of the jazz life, you’re reminded of how thoroughly these musicians were marginalised, socially and culturally”. In a 2020 New Yorker interview he was described as still seeming like just another musician trying to make a living – which has much to say about the lack of provision for towering cultural figures of American jazz such as Sanders. In New York, he carried his horn everywhere in its lumber box. He sat in on sessions where he could, and occasionally assembled bands from musicians roaming the city like him. It’s regularly reported that Farrell was re-christened Pharoah by Sun Ra, but the truth was more prosaic – it was in fact a name Sanders chose for himself on a whim when he signed union papers. He did meet and play with the Arkestra in 1964 and there are recordings of his sessions with this group from December of that year. Around this time, he also played with Don Cherry and Paul Bley, and recorded his debut as bandleader for Bernard Stollman’s ESP-Disk label. Stollman described Sanders as brusque in that brief meeting: he came in, recorded an album, and left without saying much at all. In September 1965, when he was still relatively green, Sanders joined Coltrane’s band (Coltrane was 14 years older than him). He played with him on now iconic jazz albums including Ascension, Meditations and Om. Coltrane died two years later, after which Sanders played with Alice Coltrane, including on her classic Journey in Satchidananda and Ptah, The El Daoud. Sanders recorded around 40 releases as a bandleader, and continued to play John Coltrane’s pieces, even as he insisted on cutting his own path. The core of his sound is found in the dense strata of albums made for Impulse in the late 60s and early 70s, which he recorded at a rate of two or three a year, ignoring the label’s instructions about tracks and timings. Sanders, as he often said in interviews, just played. A case in point is the essential Karma from 1969, which includes two expansive long pieces and whose influences and intent are manifest in every element: On the cover Pharoah sits in a seated yoga pose, lit by a pale aura under dancing pink and orange psychedelic lettering. From the first moments of side one, his saxophone enters like robes on regal carpets, trailed by a lush forest of shakers, bells and flutes, and followed by vocal exaltations. His playing was once described as being “like midnight riptides” – deep and fluid, possessed of powerful force and intent. His singing contains an intensity of feeling – it is devotional in passion and intuitive in delivery. In Love Will Find a Way, for example, the vocals are a lyrical motif that drive the playing itself through emotion, not form. His singing though, stood in stark contrast to his speaking – in interviews across the decades, journalists despaired at his terseness or apparent lack of interest in answering questions. In most, he spoke in frustratingly general terms. Many of his interviews are from the last 20 years, a time at which he was already a living legend, but in the short answers he does give he is straightforward and unaware of his status. In one he outlines doubts about whether he had been ready to play with John Coltrane; or whether Alice Coltrane liked the way he played. However, despite being by his own admission a person who didn’t speak much, he impresses upon his interlocutors a sense of what some called majesty, and repeatedly speaks of ambitions to make “beautiful” sounds. “I play one note, maybe that one note might mean love. And then another note might mean something else. Keep on going like that until it develops into – maybe something beautiful,” he told the New Yorker. There is an unambiguity to Sanders’ music – it is simple in its mission towards beauty, and it is this intent that perhaps endears listeners to Sanders’ early 70s work more than other avant-garde spiritual jazz players that emerged from his milieu. He evokes an open-armed, non-specific spiritualism. When there is a softness to Phraoah’s tone – as on Thembi’s Astral Travelling, or even the modernist looping of the exquisitely paused moment of Harvest Time – there remains an intensity generated by his expansive flights, that has the power to evoke the illumination of painterly shapes, like weather over landscapes. Balancing his melodic motifs was a ferocious and transcendent playing style: knotted to a groove, he would tack upwards with a fiery intensity, heard in the screaming insistence with which he re-enters the fracas on Black Unity, alongside Marvin Peterson’s trumpet. Like former collaborator Don Cherry, Sanders’ music contained references to a multicultural spiritualism – although unlike Cherry’s utopian communality, the nature of Sanders’ spiritual vision remained fairly elusive – “I look at all religions and just put them all into one,” he said. There were regular references to Egypt, and to karma and tawhid. He wore robes and also incorporated instruments into his music that were more commonly associated with folk and traditional music, from African percussion such as balafon and congas to thumb pianos and wooden flutes. (His collaboration with gnawa musician Maleem Mahmoud Ghania is an essential stop in his discography – an ecstatic fusion produced by the prodigious Bill Laswell.) After around two decades without a recording as leader, Sanders’ 2021 return with Floating Points (AKA Sam Shepherd) and the London Symphony Orchestra was received rapturously. It paired his playing with ambient electronics and orchestra, in a single-track, nine-movement piece that became his most widely recognised album outside the jazz world – it was described as “breathtaking”, “hauntingly beautiful”, and “enchanting” by both mainstream and specialist jazz reviewers. Crucially, Promises reiterated Pharoah’s living legend status, and brought his music to a younger generation of listeners. Until very recently, he was appearing live, where audience members were equally awed and troubled by his presence and frailness. Sanders’ spiritual jazz was a church with open doors, and it’s his sound’s luminous, open-armed welcome that made him the son and that endeared him to a broad audience. Like his peers, he glorified a higher spiritual power accessed through the vibrations of music, and if he never quite verbally articulated the nature of that power or spirituality, it is because he was saying everything with his playing. As Clark wrote of Sanders’ early sessions: “his group are playing music, but he’s found the thing itself”. • This article was amended on 26 and 27 September 2022. Albert Ayler did not play with John Coltrane as an earlier version said, and Coltrane’s “the father, the son and [the] holy ghost” quote was mistakenly attributed to Ayler. This has been corrected. It was further amended to reflect that Sanders never appeared live with Floating Points."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/06/national-grid-warns-households-could-face-three-hour-power-cuts-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"National Grid warns households could face three-hour power cuts this winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/06/national-grid-warns-households-could-face-three-hour-power-cuts-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/06/national-grid-warns-households-could-face-three-hour-power-cuts-this-winter","fields":{"bodyText":"Households could experience a series of three-hour power cuts this winter if Vladimir Putin shuts off gas supplies from Russia and Britain experiences a cold snap, National Grid has warned. Such an event would mean consumers in different parts of the country being notified a day in advance of three-hour blocks of time during which their power would be cut off, in an effort to reduce total consumption by 5%. The emergency plan would need to be approved by King Charles on the recommendation of the business secretary. National Grid said that in the “unlikely event” of a shortage of gas supplies that some consumers would be without power for “pre-defined periods” during a day to “ensure the overall security and integrity of the electricity system across Great Britain”. It said there would have to be reduced electricity imports from Europe and insufficient gas supply to power stations for the planned power cuts to happen. National Grid has published a range of scenarios that could occur this winter as it assesses a highly uncertain period for power supplies, amid the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A senior industry source said: “We’re heading into winter in an unprecedented situation. Even during the cold war, the Soviet Union kept the gas flowing so it’s very unpredictable.” National Grid has worked on a series of initiatives to attempt to manage supply and demand this winter. It is ready to call into action five coal-fired power plants, which can generate up to 2 gigawatts of power – after signing deals with Drax, EDF and Uniper at a cost of £340m to £395m. It will also launch a “demand flexibility service” on 1 November that will encourage businesses and consumers to use power outside peak demand periods, including early evenings on weekdays. Consumers with smart meters will be notified the day before and will be paid for using power outside these time periods. The initiative was trialled by Octopus Energy earlier this year. National Grid hopes this service will free up an extra 2GW, enough to power about 600,000 homes, if enough companies and households participate. The network operator stressed it was “cautiously confident” that there would be enough electricity to meet the demands of businesses and consumers this winter. In its “base case” scenario, National Grid’s electricity system operator believes there will be about 3.7GW more of electricity generated than the country needs. It forecast a “sufficient operational surplus throughout winter” although it expects tight margins from early December through to mid-January, excluding Christmas. However, National Grid mapped out two alternate scenarios in which a shortage of gas in Europe, which could be caused by Russia cutting supplies, or outages in another country’s generation fleet, interrupted energy supplies. Under the first scenario, electricity imports from France, Belgium and the Netherlands are cut for the whole winter. This would put the coal-fired stations into action and trigger the demand flexibility service. Under the more drastic vision, a shortage of gas would knock out around 10GW of gas-fired power generation and “temporary rota load shedding”, where consumers are disconnected, would be employed. A reduction in Russian gas supplied into Europe, including the cut off of the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline, has caused a rush for gas supplies in Europe. A European Commission target of filling gas storage facilities by 80% by 1 November looks likely to be hit, however a period of colder weather could push up demand. Although Britain is not reliant on Russian gas, importers are exposed to the knock on effects. The majority of Great Britain’s gas supplies come from the North Sea and Norway, with the bulk of the remainder from liquified natural gas imports from across the globe. Imports from Europe, notably during winter, typically account for about 6% of gas supplies. However, if a squeeze in Europe puts pressure on these supplies, Britain may be forced to seek gas from different sources, including increased LNG imports where there is competition from countries around the world. National Grid said it expected gas and electricity prices to remain high through the winter. Any potential for power cuts will also be highly dependent on the weather. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts this week said Europe could suffer a colder winter with less rain and wind than average. It predicted a period of high pressure over western Europe in November and December that could reduce the amount of renewable power generated. Fintan Slye, the executive director of National Grid ESO, said: “Under our base case, as set out in the winter outlook, we are cautiously confident that there will be adequate margins through the winter period. “As an expert and responsible operator of Great Britain’s electricity system it is incumbent on us to also factor in external factors and risks beyond our control like the unprecedented turmoil and volatility in energy markets in Europe and beyond.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/03/ireland-condemns-russian-tv-for-nuclear-attack-simulation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-03T21:56:18Z","webTitle":"Ireland condemns Russian TV for nuclear attack simulation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/ireland-condemns-russian-tv-for-nuclear-attack-simulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/03/ireland-condemns-russian-tv-for-nuclear-attack-simulation","fields":{"bodyText":"A Russian state TV report that simulated a nuclear attack launched off the coast of County Donegal has caused consternation in Ireland. Dmitry Kiselyov, a pro-Kremlin presenter on Channel One known as “Vladimir Putin’s mouthpiece”, on Monday showed a video of an underwater missile wreaking apocalypse on Ireland and the UK. Russia could “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea” using an unmanned underwater vehicle called Poseidon, he said. “The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo by Britain’s coastline will cause a gigantic tsunami wave up to 500 metres high. Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation. Having passed over the British Isles, it will turn what might be left of them into a radioactive desert.” The report did not name Ireland but the simulation showed its destruction along with Britain, which has angered the Kremlin by supplying weapons to Ukraine. Irish politicians condemned the report. Neale Richmond, a legislator with the ruling Fine Gael party, called for the expulsion of Russia’s ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. Billy Kelleher, an MEP, tweeted: “Time to tell Russian government that this wild language is simply unacceptable to us.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and naval exercises off Ireland’s coast have stirred debate in Ireland about the state’s military neutrality and feeble defence forces. The TV report made the front pages of several Irish newspapers on Tuesday, including the Irish edition of the Sun. “Mad Vlad’s off his rocket – Russia threat to nuke Ireland,” said the print headline. The Russian embassy in Dublin said in a statement: “The views and presentations in the TV show are that of the editors. The official position of Russia has always been that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and that it must never be unleashed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/28/all-in-how-we-build-country-that-works-by-lisa-nandy-review-why-labour-must-give-power-to-the-people","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"All In by Lisa Nandy review – why Labour must give power to the people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/28/all-in-how-we-build-country-that-works-by-lisa-nandy-review-why-labour-must-give-power-to-the-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/28/all-in-how-we-build-country-that-works-by-lisa-nandy-review-why-labour-must-give-power-to-the-people","fields":{"bodyText":"Two-thirds of the way through this timely book, Lisa Nandy relays a gem of a quote from Clement Attlee, Labour prime minister in the 1945-51 postwar government. “Socialists,” Attlee wrote, “are not concerned solely with material things. They do not think of human beings as a herd to be fed and watered… They think of them as individuals cooperating together to make a fine collective life.” All In: How We Build a Country That Works is an attempt to revive that ethos for 21st-century Britain, making the case for a democratic revolution to address a seemingly endless political crisis. Amid signs that a top-down managerialist approach is back in fashion in Downing Street, after Johnsonian chaos and the wild follies of Trussonomics, it feels like a much-needed intervention. Nandy begins at Wigan Athletic’s DW football stadium, remembering the first match she attended as the town’s MP. Ten years later, she found herself part of a battle to save the club, after a new owner based in Hong Kong put it into administration at the first opportunity. Recalling the fire sale of assets that took place before weeping, baffled employees, she writes: “Fans and a community that should have been at the heart of the process were shut out, treated as a nuisance by wealthy and powerful people with no connection to the club… the wrong people held all the power.” A town with one of the highest proportion of low earners in the country fundraised a remarkable £615,000 and Wigan were eventually rescued. But the episode inspired Nandy to sit down and write. Repeatedly, All In offers vivid portraits of communities obliged to mount resistance campaigns against distant companies, institutions and governments that see only the logic of the bottom line. There are the proud NHS hospital porters and cleaners of Wigan’s Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, who find they are to be offloaded to a private company and an uncertain future. The last pub in a working-class area is threatened with closure by developers. Preserved as a community asset, it is later voted Wigan’s pub of the year. Such inspiring victories, Nandy points out, are exceptions to the rule in an era in which the odds are stacked in favour of market forces. These local vignettes capture a wider sense of civic and economic powerlessness in much of the the UK, one that, Nandy argues, a generation of politicians either ignored or failed to understand. Brewing in English towns for 40 years, it drove the “red wall” Brexit vote. Globalisation – and, in particular, the role of the Chinese economy as a source of cheap labour – saw 6m British manufacturing jobs disappear. The power of unions diminished accordingly and was further undermined by successive Thatcher governments. New Labour mitigated the economic impact of deindustrialisation, but its strategy for growth focused overwhelmingly on cities. Towns such as Wigan, ageing and neglected, were ripe for revolt and the 2016 referendum was the opportunity they needed. This problem, writes Nandy, was “largely unanticipated by parliament, political parties and the media because they had become so deeply disconnected from so many of the people they were meant to represent”. When it came, too many on the left were happy to dismiss leave voters as xenophobic reactionaries. The People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum after the Brexit vote is given short shrift, accused of mirroring the intransigent belligerence of those pushing for “no deal”. “The willingness to embrace populist rhetoric, ultimately ends up wrecking democratic debate. Offering simplistic solutions – ‘Just leave with no deal’ or ‘Have another referendum’” – did a disservice to the messy complexities of the crisis. Many remain-voting Observer readers and Labour members will bridle at that analysis and Nandy does not address the economic damage done by leaving the EU. But her object is to diagnose a crisis of exclusion that found a form of expression in 2016. Numerous social divisions – between London and the rest of the country, cities and towns, the asset-rich and the asset-poor, graduates and non-graduates – have created a fractured country that has been conducting a dialogue of the deaf. The rise of social media has helped to turn up the volume and the vitriol and diminished the possibility of genuine debate. Nandy advocates, in effect, a major rebalancing of social forces: one in which local authorities, trade unions, community organisations, regional banks and citizens assemblies can constrain capital and give power and resources back to people and places. From local carbon budgets to prioritising local ownership of community assets, a host of ideas is floated to illustrate the desired direction of travel. As Britain endures apparent permacrisis, the book’s publication was brought forward from next March. Such is the pace of events in Westminster that Boris Johnson’s boosterish “levelling up” rhetoric - pithily critiqued here by Nandy for its lack of substance - has now been eclipsed by a new politics of austerity under Rishi Sunak. The disastrous Truss interlude has handed the Labour party a huge poll lead and given markets the power to dictate the terms of British politics, a combination of circumstances likely to reinforce Labour’s cautious and centralising instincts. All In is a salutary reminder from the shadow secretary of state for levelling up of why this agenda must be reclaimed by the left and done properly. It is also, at close to 200 pages, a fast and accessible read from a politician who interpreted the signs of the times in Brexiting Britain earlier than most. At times, the writing feels a little rushed, as Nandy attempts to keep up with an ever-changing political backdrop and there are some needless repetitions. We read more than once, for example, that “the path to net zero is paved with a million jobs”. But Nandy’s thesis is surely right. The deep shortcomings of Britain’s post-industrial settlement will not be solved by rejoining the EU or the return of “grownups” to Downing Street and something more ambitious is required than managerial competence in Whitehall. Lisa Nandy has an attractive faith in the essential decency and good sense of her fellow citizens and in their ability to cooperate and find constructive common ground when given the chance. At one point in All In, she writes: “Hand people power and resources and they will make the country work.” That is a deceptively radical vision and one that Labour should embrace. • All In: How We Build a Country That Works by Lisa Nandy is published by HarperNorth (£16.99).

Njoo is among a growing contingent of Australians who prefer to do business with firms that have a good ethical track record, especially when it comes to climate change. “Choosing a bank and super fund that have an ethical business model and approach to investing is a way for me to have an impact on how society works that isn’t through voting, because I’m not old enough to do that yet,” she says. Njoo, who is studying journalism and a bachelor of creative intelligence and innovation, has been a climate activist since school. She chose Bank Australia because its responsible banking policy aligns with her values. “Being climate aware in everyday choices is a big part of my ethical values,” she says. “My school had a focus on social justice, and that informed my values. We were taught everything we do matters.” Your choices can make a difference There are two main options open to consumers who wish to exercise their power when it comes to climate change. The first is through their own actions and the second is through the pressure they exert on the companies with which they do business. Climate Council councillor and economist Nicki Hutley says the choices that consumers such as Njoo make send important messages to businesses. “If consumers make clear choices in terms of their bank and superannuation fund, they can make sure governments and other businesses get those messages loud and clear,” Hutley says. The Market Forces website is a useful resource for people looking for information about banks whose values match their own. The site houses a database of banks’ and their subsidiaries’ records when it comes to funding fossil fuels, as well as a list of banks that have not funded this sector since 2016. When it comes to taking personal responsibility to help combat climate change, Hutley says the first step should be to think about where you get your energy and switching to renewable sources. Photo supplied. Photographer: Liam Neal. “Getting off gas is a big one,” she says. “Disconnect your house from fossil fuel energy sources and, to the extent you can, get onto renewable energy. Have a look at which renewable energy companies offer the best deals and make choices that send signals to providers to say, ‘we want more renewables’.” Behavioural change expert Claire O’Rourke agrees there are plenty of ways for consumers to demand businesses take action on climate change. She recommends checking companies’ climate goals and strategies for achieving them. This includes looking at whether their goals align with climate change science. Although it’s easy to assume consumers can’t exercise much power on their own over the businesses from which they buy products and services, this is not the case, O’Rourke says. Businesses care what their customers think about how they do things. If you do switch suppliers for climate change reasons, O’Rourke recommends calling the company you’re leaving to tell them why. “I did that when I left my bank, and they said they were getting lots of phone calls for the same reasons,” she says. “That kind of feedback makes a difference to a company’s strategy over time. Don’t believe you can’t prompt change because you’re only one person. You absolutely can.” Photo courtesy of Bank Australia. It’s also an idea to tell your friends, family members and work colleagues what you’re doing and why, when switching your bank, energy company or super fund, O’Rourke says. It’s likely you’ll inspire other people to make similar choices. Businesses taking responsibility Personal action aside, experts agree the onus is on businesses to take a bigger part in collective action around climate change. “Companies that bring their boards and shareholders on a journey now are going to be well placed to take advantage of the clean revolution that’s already underway globally and in Australia,” O’Rourke says. On a practical level, businesses urgently need to reduce their consumption of high-emission inputs such as coal-fired energy and find low or zero-emission alternatives. “Companies also need to publicly advocate for climate change solutions,” she says. “They need to call for policies and regulation that will assist them in the transition to a low-carbon economy.” Between them, consumers and companies might be able to make a difference.

With a concerted effort, there could still be time. But time is the critical thing. And on the campaign trail in “red wall” seats before the May elections, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, repeatedly promised building nuclear reactors “one a year for eight years”. Last week at the Conservative conference in Wales he was at it again – this time promising one on Anglesey and another at Trawsfynydd in Mid Wales. Anyone who knows a little about nuclear reactors (current designs 10 years late and £10bn over budget) or about the prime minister’s other mega-projects – bridges across the Thames and Irish Sea, and an airport in the Thames estuary – is confident that this won’t happen. A protest via my MP brought a measured response from Greg Hands, the minister responsible for energy policy. He said provided reactors were value for money and technically sound, the government’s target for nuclear projects was to give one a final investment decision this parliament, and two in the next – so maybe three building starts by 2030. On current trends that means one reactor possibly ready by 2040 and two others much later. Far too late to heal the climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/mar/27/three-ways-robert-downey-jrs-vertigo-might-not-be-hollywoods-stupidest-ever-idea","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T16:03:39Z","webTitle":"Three ways Robert Downey Jr’s Vertigo might not be Hollywood’s stupidest ever idea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/three-ways-robert-downey-jrs-vertigo-might-not-be-hollywoods-stupidest-ever-idea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/mar/27/three-ways-robert-downey-jrs-vertigo-might-not-be-hollywoods-stupidest-ever-idea","fields":{"bodyText":"You need chutzpah to be successful in Hollywood; you’ve got to have brash moves and audacious ideas, sometimes ones belonging to other people. Robert Downey Jr’s plan to remake Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo – one of the greatest films of all time – is aiming very very high, like planning to tightrope-walk between the two towers of San Francisco’s Golden Gate bridge. Don’t look down. Downey Jr reportedly intends to produce and star himself in the role that James Stewart made iconic: ex-cop Scottie, traumatised by his fear of heights and a recent psychological breakdown, who falls in love from afar with the beautiful, mysterious woman, played by Kim Novak, who he’s been asked to trail by her husband. And then, after a traumatic episode, he becomes obsessed with another woman who eerily appears to be her exact double. The screenplay will reportedly be written by Steven Knight, currently receiving mixed notices for his new BBC adaptation of Dickens’s Great Expectations, a looser version taking such revisionist liberties with the original that it could itself be considered a kind of remake. But who is going to play the Kim Novak role? And – perhaps even trickier – who will play Scottie’s ex-girlfriend Midge (originally played by Barbara Bel Geddes) whose glasses are an integral part of understanding Vertigo’s role in the critical discourse around the male – and female – gaze? It’s a scene-stealer of a role. There shouldn’t be too much pearl-clutching at the idea of remaking Vertigo, or any classic. Vertigo has had a remake already – a Tamil film in 1965 called Kalangarai Vilakkam – while much of Brian De Palma’s career could be considered a sort of Vertigo retread, particularly his Hitchcockian films Obsession and Body Double. Steven Soderbergh remade Tarkovsky’s Solaris and the result was a deeply intelligent, worthwhile film. Hitchcock himself remade his own films. Gus Van Sant’s shot-for-shot Psycho remake was initially derided but then came to have its own connoisseur fanbase – though his decision to stick so respectfully to the original could be part of why cinephiles came to cut him some slack. So option A is for Downey Jr and Knight to do the same thing: an eerily precise duplication that would also be a droll meta-joke about the body double; the Hitchcock original and its Downey Jr remake being Novak-type twins. Perhaps 90-year-old Novak can have a cameo. Option B is going back to the literary source material: the 1954 French novel D’Entre Les Morts (or The Living and the Dead) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (and of course Downey Jr may high-mindedly announce that his film is not a remake but a new version of this novel). It was set in occupied France in 1940; Downey Jr and Knight could set their movie in that place and at that time, or they could stick to a late-50s, early-60s San Francisco. Either way, it will probably have to be set before the era of Google Image searching and digital tech, which would ruin the plot. But there is another big question for anyone wanting to do this and one with which Hitchcock himself grappled. Do you save the big reveal for the end, as in the novel? Or do you reveal it two-thirds in – Hitchcock’s own bold change – in order to explain the heroine’s tormented emotional state? It could be that Knight and Downey Jr will revert to the original and create a new “flashback” segment to preserve that twist. Then there is casting the Novak role of Madeleine. Anya Taylor-Joy? Lily James? Elle Fanning? Or perhaps get away from stifling Anglo-patriarchal waspy blondness and go for Janelle Monáe or Zendaya? Or if modern-day Hollywood is squeamish about age-gap issues (Stewart was 50 to Novak’s 25) you could give the Madeleine role to someone like Cate Blanchett. But perhaps it is precisely the age gap that gives it the creepiness. But it’s time to consider option C: the nuclear option, and don’t tell me Knight hasn’t thought about it. Gender-flipping the movie means Downey Jr surrendering the lead but keeping his producer credit. It’s been done with films as varied Ghostbusters and The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant. So the Stewart role goes to tough-yet-troubled San Francisco ex-cop … Patricia Arquette? She has to tail the exquisitely beautiful Timothée Chalamet, as he goes shopping, then she becomes mad about the boy, and falls in love with his exact double. It’s a dizzying thought."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/01/uk-households-spending-power-drop-resolution-foundation-energy-bills-warning-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"UK households’ spending power to drop by £3,000, warns thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/01/uk-households-spending-power-drop-resolution-foundation-energy-bills-warning-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/01/uk-households-spending-power-drop-resolution-foundation-energy-bills-warning-poverty","fields":{"bodyText":"Households in Britain will see their spending power cut by an average £3,000 by the end of next year unless the new government acts to counter the biggest drop in living standards in at least a century, research has indicated. Adding to pressure on Boris Johnson’s successor as prime minister to tackle a worsening cost of living crisis, the Resolution Foundation thinktank said soaring energy bills would cut household incomes by 10% and push an extra 3 million people into poverty. The thinktank said the outlook for living standards was “shocking” and “terrifying”, noting that without beefed-up support from the state, the drop in the typical household’s income would be twice as severe as that in the global financial crisis of the late 2000s and worse than the 8% drop that followed the oil price shock of the mid-1970s. Lalitha Try, a Resolution Foundation researcher, said: “No responsible government could accept such an outlook, so radical policy action is required to address it. We are going to need an energy support package worth tens of billions of pounds, coupled with increasing benefits next year by October’s inflation rate.” It came as a separate report warned that a “significant humanitarian crisis with millions of children’s development blighted” is on the way without urgent government support to alleviate fuel poverty. The report, led by Prof Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE), warned that high fuel costs and rising poverty were damaging health and that growing up in cold homes would have “dangerous consequences” for many children now and into adulthood. Cold homes adversely affect children’s development, and cause and worsen respiratory conditions and mental health problems. With prices rising faster than wages, the Resolution Foundation said inflation-adjusted average incomes would continue falling until at least the middle of next year – taking real earnings back to their levels of 2003. Living standards were on course to drop by 5% in the current 2022-23 financial year and by a further 6% in 2023-24 – a two-year decline unprecedented even during the hardship suffered during the second world war. The two-decade-long wage depression was a consequence not just of the present high level of inflation, but of more than 15 years of economic stagnation driven primarily by historically weak productivity, the thinktank added. Liz Truss, the frontrunner to replace Johnson, has made tax cuts central to her pitch to be prime minister but has not ruled out direct financial support to help people struggling with their energy bills. A package is expected before the price cap is raised to more than £3,500 a year on 1 October. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1% but the Bank of England expects it to climb above 13% in October. The cost of living outlook has worsened since Threadneedle Street announced its forecasts last month and the US investment bank Citi said inflation could reach 18% by the middle of next year. Poorer households faced a higher-than-average inflation rate because more of their income was spent on the two items largely responsible for cost of living pressures – food and energy. The thinktank said by October the least well-off 10% of households would face an inflation rate of 15%. It added that in the absence of a policy shift or a better economic performance, absolute poverty – where income is insufficient to maintain basic living standards – would rise from 17% to 22% of the population by 2024. The jump from 11 million to 14 million would be the sharpest rise on record. “Furthermore, absolute child poverty is expected to rocket from 23% in 2021-22 to 31% in 2023-24, an increase of 1 million children”, the thinktank said in a report, In at the Deep End, detailing the cost of living challenge facing the new prime minister. Real incomes were expected to start rising again once inflation fell back during 2023 but would reverse only part of the decline suffered this year and next, the report said. Average household incomes would be 7% lower in 2024 than in 2019 – comfortably the worst performance during any parliament on record. Try said: “Britain is already experiencing the biggest fall in real pay since 1977, and a tough winter looms as energy bills hit £500 a month. With high inflation likely to stay with us for much of next year, the outlook for living standards is frankly terrifying. “Typical households are on course to see their real incomes fall by £3,000 over the next two years – the biggest squeeze in at least a century – while 3 million extra people could fall into absolute poverty.” Johnson, who leaves Downing Street next week, has warned voters the coming months would be “tough” but the Resolution Foundation warned that the cost of living crisis would stretch into 2024, making it vital the UK grappled with the twin long-term challenges of low growth and high inequality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/17/jeremy-hunt-latest-tory-u-turn-liz-truss","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T19:36:13Z","webTitle":"‘Hunt’s running the show’: the day power drained away from Liz Truss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/17/jeremy-hunt-latest-tory-u-turn-liz-truss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/17/jeremy-hunt-latest-tory-u-turn-liz-truss","fields":{"bodyText":"When it was announced that Penny Mordaunt had offered to stand in for Liz Truss in response to an urgent Commons question over the economic crisis on Monday, some Conservative MPs thought it was a joke. “Why is she asking one of her biggest rivals for the job to take her place? She’ll totally show her up,” one said. It was hard to see the cabinet minister’s performance on Monday afternoon as anything other than an audition for the top job. Mordaunt did little to dispel that impression as she landed punchy attacks on the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, roused the depressed Tory troops, and offered an apology to the country for the instability caused by the prime minister’s dramatic climbdown. Truss had done none of these things publicly, though probably should have done all of them. Nevertheless, it was Truss’s refusal to show up and face MPs herself – despite unleashing chaos on the party, the economy and the country – that most riled MPs. Mordaunt repeatedly assured them there was a “genuine reason” why she was not there. In one particularly bizarre exchange, she insisted: “The prime minister is not under a desk.” But where was she? Truss was, the Guardian revealed, holed up with Sir Graham Brady, the powerful chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, in her Commons office. Downing Street sources claimed it was a planned meeting, rather than a crisis talk, but conceded it was inevitable that her fragile position would have come up. Truss’s decline from shiny new prime minister at optimum strength just 41 days ago to being in office but very much not in power has been a sorry story of misjudgments, blinding ideology, inexperience, humiliating climbdowns and lack of human connection. But the last 24 hours have underlined just how weak she is. When they met at Chequers on Sunday lunchtime for a three-hour meeting, her new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt – now the most powerful man in government – was clear what Truss needed to do. If she wanted to avoid an economic crisis and restore any shred of Tory competence, Trussonomics had to be junked. In the privacy of her grace-and-favour country mansion, with just their closest aides around them, Hunt went through line by line what was left of the mini-budget. The 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax would have to go, he told her, and the energy support package would have to be substantially scaled back. “That was particularly painful for her,” one Downing Street insider said. “It was virtually her only attack line left against Labour and she had just deployed it at last week’s PMQs. This week’s is going to be very difficult.” Hunt also convinced her that the climbdown should happen sooner, rather than later, to avoid market meltdown. Truss, devastated but determined to cling on, returned to Downing Street late on Sunday night. Just a few hours later, in the early hours of Monday morning, the Treasury confirmed that Hunt would make a statement. By the time Downing Street staff arrived at work, Operation “Save Liz” was already in full force. Her closest political friend and deputy prime minister, Thérèse Coffey, was at her side as she mapped out to aides what would turn out to be one of the most difficult days of an already torrid premiership. After they were joined in No 10 by Hunt, the trio led a virtual meeting of the cabinet at 10am to share the U-turn plans. Truss opened the session by reminding her top team the government had taken immediate action to address the cost of living crisis with a huge energy support package – and insisted she remained committed to the growth agenda. Hunt then went through all the measures that were going to be dumped – but blamed the changes on the “worsening global economic situation, with interest rates rising around the world as monetary policy returns to a sense of normality”. There was little contrition. The education secretary, Kit Malthouse, highlighted the global factors that had made life more difficult for Truss, but did not dwell on the role played by her own disastrous decisions. The Welsh secretary, Robert Buckland, called for payroll reforms. Only Kemi Badenoch, the trade secretary, raised the prospect of how the U-turn would go down. “She said we had to make sure it landed properly after last time,” one source said. Less than an hour later, at 11am, Hunt made his televised statement, dropping bombshell after bombshell and leaving many Tory MPs wondering how Truss could survive. In the short term at least, the markets rallied, leaving ministers and government aides breathing a deep sigh of relief. But Tory MPs were not happy. The former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told Times Radio that if it became apparent to Tory MPs that Truss was not up the job, a way would be found to get rid of her. “It means that if she cannot do the job, then she will be replaced.” Angela Richardson became the fourth Tory MP to publicly state that Truss should go. “I just don’t think that it’s tenable that she can stay in her position any longer. And I’m very sad to have to say that,” she said. A few hours later, the veteran MP Charles Walker became the fifth. “If she doesn’t go right now, it will not be her decision,” he said. Downing Street told reporters that the prime minister was not going anywhere, but the mood in the parliamentary party was darkening. There were rumours of Tory MPs being threatened with a general election if they did not back off. Hunt held a hastily organised private briefing for Tory MPs in a bid to “calm the horses”. To a hushed crowd of ashen faces, he said the worst was yet to come – given that the U-turns on mini-budget measures would fill only about half of the expected £70bn fiscal black hole. While several present said he urged colleagues to give Truss credit for blowing up her economic agenda and recognising their concerns, one dismissed it as “lip service”. After the nearly 90-minute briefing was over, another remained unconvinced, quipping: “It’s clear he’s running the show.” But the question lingers of what is now the point of the prime minister. Her allies claimed that key parts of her growth plan – supply side reforms – are still to come. “If these things were easy and straightforward, somebody would have done them by now,” one said. “We need Liz to push them through.” Not everybody in Downing Street agrees. “The mood is one of powerlessness,” one insider said. “There’s no control. We’re just managing hour by hour, but it feels like we’re lurching from crisis to crisis.” When Truss finally did emerge after her meeting with Brady, it was to sit alongside the chancellor in the Commons as he confirmed the biggest climbdown in modern political history. Her face was fixed in a rictus smile as she listened to him bury her political project amid the jeers of Labour MPs and the relative silence of her own benches. But if one of the aims for the massive volte-face was to save her premiership, it was far from clear it had been successful. One member of the 1922 executive, which has the power to change party rules or send in the “men in grey suits” to tell her the game is up, claimed she would not make it until the end of the week. “I’m not sure this has bought her more time,” they said. “It’s just a terrible admission that her authority has gone. Something will happen this week. The mood is such that it demands action. When the herd moves, the herd moves.” Despite everything, Truss is continuing her “outreach” with Tory MPs, determined to save her premiership, even though that looks virtually impossible. At 6pm she met the One Nation group of Tory MPs, where she admitted the government would need to “cut our cloth” according to the economic situation – and finally said sorry for the mistakes of the past few weeks. Later, she was due to round off a gruelling day at an informal reception with “drinks and nibbles” with her cabinet, before starting the whole engagement process again on Tuesday. But as one despondent minister said: “She may have bought herself some time, but it’s equally possible that she may have not. It feels very volatile. We just don’t know.” • This article was amended on 18 October 2022. An earlier version described Robert Buckland as the justice secretary, which was a previous role.

He was well aware of the huge difficulties of trying to ensure the outcome of “the endless search for safety”, which became the subject of the last chapter of the book drawn from the lecture series, The Two Edged Sword: Armed Force in the Modern World (1982). While advocating vigorous and open debate, he recognised the difficulty of achieving a relationship of trust with a nuclear power such the former Soviet Union, and was “relatively pessimistic” about the prospects of a greater degree of western European unity and self-reliance in defence matters. Our peace was of a provisional kind, and in order to maintain the balance of power, security must be on hand when needed: every generation had to make its own security. Thus he strongly opposed unilateral disarmament and argued for vigorous defensive efforts, combined with maintaining conventional weapon capability and maritime power. In a letter to the Telegraph in 2014, before the Russian invasion of Crimea, he reiterated the need for the balance of power to be maintained in the west. His books included Peace Without Victory: Woodrow Wilson and the British Liberals (1958), Arms and Strategy: An International Survey of Modern Defence (1973), Strategic Thought in the Nuclear Age (1979) and The Changing Face of Nuclear Warfare (1987). Regarded by some as rightwing, or an “extreme moderate”, Laurie himself considered his politics to be middle of the road. He was a consummate committee man, able to sway opinion by dint of his quick thinking, diplomacy and personal charm, gaining the respect and admiration of those he worked with. Curious about everyone he met, he had an innate sense of fairness. These qualities were invaluable assets for his involvement in many national and international institutions. They included the Center for Stategic and International Studies in Washington, where Henry Kissinger was another leading light, from 1969, which he served as co-chair from 1998 and senior adviser for six years from 2000. In London he was involved with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, serving on its council 1973-83, and the Institute for the Study of Conflict. The culmination of his work as a security strategist came as director of Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1991-96). This post coincided with the end of the cold war, when the institute’s experts, researchers and staff played a key role in facilitating dialogue between members of governments and policymakers surrounding the challenges of the break-up of the Soviet Union, war in Yugoslavia and its dissolution, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the United Nations’ increased role in international politics. At the same time, since core government funding of Chatham House had ceased (it is now an independent body), Laurie helped modernise its fundraising, and promoted improved communications to policymakers by developing its use of the internet. Once he had spent some years in the US, Laurie never quite lost a slight mid-Atlantic accent. But he was very proud of having been born and brought up in Cornwall: his mother, Florence (nee Woodward), worked in the local brewery in St Austell, and his father, Leonard Martin, was a teacher. From St Austell grammar school Laurie went to Christ’s College, Cambridge to take a degree in history (1948). Then he did two years of national service with the RAF as a pilot officer, later flying officer, based in Cornwall. The first time he crossed the Atlantic was to take a PhD on Woodrow Wilson at Yale. He went on to be assistant professor at MIT (1955-61), associate professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and research associate at the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research. Back in Britain he became Woodrow Wilson professor of international politics at the University of Wales in 1964, and four years later head of the war studies department at King’s College London. He expanded it, introduced an ethicist and a diplomatic historian, and took a keen interest in the development of the college’s Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, where I got to know him. His next move, to become vice-chancellor at the University of Newcastle in 1978, reflected the recognition of his skills in negotiation and administration. His 12 years at Newcastle came during a time of reform in the higher education system and expansion of the university. He was a popular figure, and his decision to allow Channel 4 to film a documentary series, Redbrick, in 1985, proved successful, bringing the work and life of the university to a wide audience. In 1994 he was knighted, and in retirement he enjoyed his garden in Suffolk, fishing in Northumberland and trips on steam trains. He married Betty Parnall in 1951 and they had a daughter, Jane, and son, Bill. His wife and daughter predeceased him; his son and two grandsons, Tom and Jack, survive him. • Laurence Woodward Martin, historian and security strategist, born 30 July 1928; died 24 April 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/25/iran-and-us-ready-to-restart-talks-on-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-25T16:37:33Z","webTitle":"Iran and US ready to restart talks on nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/iran-and-us-ready-to-restart-talks-on-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/25/iran-and-us-ready-to-restart-talks-on-nuclear-deal","fields":{"bodyText":"Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, has said talks will restart on the Iran nuclear deal, averting a complete collapse in the agreement which could spark a nuclear arms race across the Middle East. After a meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in Tehran, Borrell said he had broken the stalemate which had led to talks on the revival of the nuclear deal being stalled since March. Borrell gave no detail about the exact date of the resumption of talks or the precise format, but said the process had the agreement of Iran and the US. He also met Iran’s national security chief Ali Shamkhani. Previous talks broke down with most aspects of the US’s return to the nuclear agreement settled. However the US president, Joe Biden, was not willing to accept Iran’s demand that sanctions be lifted on the Islamic revolutionary guard corps (IRGC) by ending its designation as a foreign terrorist organisation. Iran had recently privately revised that stipulation, but then felt the US had not reciprocated by setting out the future steps the IRGC could take to end its terrorist designation. At a joint press conference in Tehran, Amir-Abdollahian said: “We are ready to resume the Vienna talks within the next days.” He expressed hope that the US would “this time” pursue a “realistic and fair approach” and give Iran the full economic benefit of the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPoA). In 2018 Donald Trump announced he would impose “the highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran and pulled the US out of the agreement. The Iranian foreign minister said he held “detailed, precise and deep” talks with Borrell on the JCPoA revival negotiations, adding: “We are going to break the stalemate in the Vienna talks and end the tension that has existed in recent days.” Borrell later said the initial talks will not take place in Vienna because the discussions involve the US, Iran and the EU. He said they would take place in a Gulf country. If they succeed, the deal would be referred to a wider meeting of the JCPoA, including the other signatories of Russia and China, in Vienna. Pressure had been building for the resumption of talks as the UN nuclear inspectorate had lost almost all effective access to Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran had responded to a censure motion passed earlier this month by the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency by disconnecting some cameras in its facilities, undermining the UN’s “continuity of knowledge” about Iranian nuclear activities. Many regional observers remain dubious that a deal will be reached, but the Ukraine war has not produced an economic windfall for Iran as Russia has been offering its oil to China at a discount price, squeezing Iran out of key markets. Iran’s oil exports to China had fallen by 34% as of May, according to Hamid Hosseini, president of the Oil and Gas Exporters’ Union in Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/30/asia-pacific-flashpoints-fuelling-regional-arms-race-taiwan-north-korea-south-china-sea-pacific-islands","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-04T00:15:11Z","webTitle":"Asia’s arms race: potential flashpoints from Taiwan to the South China Sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/asia-pacific-flashpoints-fuelling-regional-arms-race-taiwan-north-korea-south-china-sea-pacific-islands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/30/asia-pacific-flashpoints-fuelling-regional-arms-race-taiwan-north-korea-south-china-sea-pacific-islands","fields":{"bodyText":"Global militarisation has increased rapidly over the course of the 21st century, with a clear recalibration towards the Asia Pacific. Between 2000 and 2021, annual military spending increased from $1.12trn (in 2020 dollar terms) to $2.11trn. In that time, the share of global defence spending in Asia and Oceania increased from 18% to 28%, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Growing concerns over China, whose defence spending has increased steadily for nearly three decades, has fuelled an arms race across the region, upending decades-long regional conventions and revealing several potential flashpoints. Taiwan The biggest concern about China’s military expansion is how it ties in to plans to annex Taiwan. The risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the highest it’s been in decades, but predictions of when it might happen vary. Recently a number of senior US military leaders have offered alarmingly imminent dates including 2023, 2025 and 2027. American assessments are crucial, given it’s possible the US military will help defend Taiwan against Chinese attacks, but some analysts caution that these military figures are likely exaggerating to lobby for more funding. Sources say the public predictions have frustrated Taiwan’s president, who is trying to ensure people are worried enough about the China threat that they support her policies, but not so much that they give up hope. However, the scale of China’s military expansion offers analysts some clues to its ambitions for Taiwan. While still spending a smaller share of its GDP on defence than the US, China’s defence budget will increase by 7.2% in 2023, taking it to the highest point it’s ever been. The US Department of Defense estimates that China’s real military spending could be up to twice as much as the officially reported figures. In response, the defence portion of the most recent US budget has prioritised ramping up the military presence in the Indo-Pacific. This month the US also approved the potential sale of $619m in new weapons to Taiwan. Just as important as the increased spending is how it affects the balance of military strength in the region. In 2000, China was the second-largest defence spender in the Indo-Pacific. By 2021 it was spending more on defence than the next 13 countries in the region combined. China has also taken great exception to a tripartite agreement between Australia, the US and the UK. The AU$368bn deal, known as Aukus, will see the US and UK help Australia acquire at least three nuclear-powered submarines over the next three decades. Aukus is widely seen as being aimed at countering China’s military expansion, and has drawn mixed reactions. China accused the allies of deception, using loopholes in non-proliferation treaties, and “walking further and further down the path of error and danger”. Australia’s defence minister responded by saying, “China invests … in its own defence capabilities; we are doing that in respect of ours.” Helen Davidson in Taipei and Amy Hawkins North Korea Having launched about 90 ballistic missiles and other weapons in 2022 – more than in any other year – North Korea appears intent on setting a new record this year. It has held 11 rounds of missile tests, some involving more than one weapon, so far in 2023, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and, according to state media, strategic cruise missiles with a nuclear capability. In a sign that the regime in Pyongyang has no intention of relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction, it recently unveiled new, smaller nuclear warheads and vowed to produce more weapons-grade nuclear material. Kim Jong-un called for an “exponential increase” in the regime’s nuclear arsenal at the end of last year. The North’s provocations are directed towards its nemeses: the US and South Korea. As March drew to a close, forces from both countries engaged in joint maritime exercises that included nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Nimitz, days after they ended their largest joint military exercises in five years. The allies insist the drills are purely defensive in nature, but Pyongyang condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion. Rising tensions on the Korean peninsula have triggered a hardline response from South Korea’s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who has warned that Seoul will not provide a “single penny” to the North as long as it continues to develop nuclear weapons. More worryingly for those eager to dial down tensions, a serious debate is unfolding over whether Seoul should acquire its own nuclear deterrent – a move a majority of South Koreans support, according to polls. In Japan, concern over North Korea and an increasingly assertive China has boosted the case for steering the country further away from its postwar “pacifism.” Late last year, the government of prime minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would double defence spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, abandoning its self-imposed cap of 1% of GDP. The increasingly unstable security environment in the Asia-Pacific has been the catalyst for a long-awaited thaw in relations between Japan and South Korea – both US allies with tens of thousands of American troops based on their territory. In March, Yoon and Kishida became the first South Korean and Japanese leaders to hold bilateral talks for 12 years. Their summit in Tokyo came amid attempts to resolve disputes connected to their bitter wartime legacy, and resulted in an agreement to resume reciprocal visits and a security dialogue after a five-year hiatus. Justin McCurry in Tokyo South China Sea The South China Sea is one of the most strategically and economically important waterways in the world. It is one of the world’s busiest trading routes, rich in marine life and is thought to contain significant reserves of oil and natural gas. It’s also highly contested. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, with its so-called “nine-dash” line marking the limit of the country’s claim – though an international tribunal in The Hague has rejected this. The Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims. The US, while not a claimant, considers the water crucial to its national interests. Under president Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines has taken a much tougher stance on the dispute, with Manila accusing Chinese vessels of “aggressive actions” in the South China Sea. Marcos has vowed the country “will not lose one inch” of its territory, and has overseen a massive shift in foreign policy, strengthening defence ties with the US and its allies. In March the Philippines expanded US access to its military bases, enhancing Washington’s footprint in the region, and enabling it to more easily monitor Chinese activity in the South China Sea near Taiwan. It has also strengthened military ties with Japan and Australia, two US allies. In contrast to neighbouring Southeast Asia countries that have expressed concerns over Aukus, which some nations fear could prompt an arms race that destabilises the region, the Philippines has supported the development. The approach taken by Marcos, who came to power last year, is a stark contrast to that of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte had sought closer economic ties with Beijing and was reluctant to confront China over its activities in the South China sea – even as China constructed military bases on human-made islands, and Chinese vessels harassed, or rammed, Filippine boats. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok Pacific Islands Pacific leaders have repeatedly stressed that they don’t want to be drawn into a geostrategic contest between the US and China, and have resisted the notion of picking a side. They have also repeatedly said the climate crisis is their top security threat. However, China is increasingly active in seeking influence among Pacific island countries, including in security and policing. These efforts have prompted something of a reckoning in Australia, New Zealand and the US, which have all moved to step up their diplomatic efforts. Beijing’s progress in the region was most sharply illustrated by the signing of a security agreement with Solomon Islands nearly a year ago. A leaked draft suggested that the agreement would allow China to respond to requests from police and armed forces to carry out a range of tasks such as maintaining social order and protecting “the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. Australian officials had privately raised fears that the deal might pave the way for a future Chinese naval presence about 1,700km from the country’s coast, although the prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has repeatedly assured Australia and other countries that there will never be a foreign military base in his country. China also sought a sweeping regional security deal with 10 Pacific countries last year, but this was rebuffed by Pacific leaders over concerns that Beijing was trying to bypass established structures such as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Other countries have scrambled to respond to China’s diplomatic pursuits. Since coming to power last year, Australia’s Labor government has placed a priority on restoring trust with Pacific leaders. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and others have made a series of high-level visits stressing that security should be the responsibility of the immediate region (not China). Australia aims to finish negotiating a bilateral security agreement with Papua New Guinea by the end of April, having signed a deal with Vanuatu in December. The US has acknowledged its own need to step up in the region, which has seen it reopen its embassy in Solomon Islands in February, but western officials are under no illusions about the trends. Despite initial relief at the decision by Pacific island countries to defer China’s sweeping security proposals, the Australian government believes this may be only a temporary reprieve.

The clocks on the walls show three times – Canberra, London and Washington – reflecting the fact Australia is depending on the United Kingdom and the United States to achieve what V Adm Jonathan Mead calls “a generational challenge” that will “redefine Australia’s strategic personality”. Even towards the end of the planning process, eight or nine working groups have been holding regular virtual teleconferences at night with US and UK counterparts, said Mead. “It is truly a trilateral pathway and trilateral partnership,” the head of the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce declares. ‘Not a binary choice’ Leaks out of the UK and the US this week have started to point to the outlines of a deal that will be officially announced in San Diego on Monday, US time. The Guardian has reported the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology – an outcome also reported by Bloomberg. But that does not preclude a US interim solution to plug a potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s. Reuters cited four US officials as saying Australia was expected to buy up to five US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines in the 2030s – although this would appear to clash with congressional concerns about Australia leapfrogging US needs on its own crowded production line. The Australian government – determined not to leak the details of what it calls its “optimal pathway” to obtain at least eight nuclear-powered submarines – has refused to confirm any of the details ahead of the announcement. But Mead, who leads a taskforce of more than 350 officials from its Canberra office site, appears keen to scotch the idea of outright winners and losers from a process that has been under way for the past year and a half. He maintains it is not a “binary” choice between US or UK options. “I think the three leaders – when you see the announcement – will be very satisfied that we have been able to bring together something that is trilateral,” Mead said. Making waves When the Aukus security partnership was first unveiled in September 2021, it came as a bolt from the blue and triggered significant diplomatic reverberations – both with Australia’s friends and foes. The abrupt scrapping of Australia’s $90bn plan for French designed conventional submarines sparked an immediate rift with Paris – and was the impetus for Emmanuel Macron’s infamous complaint that “I don’t think, I know” that the then-prime minister Scott Morrison lied to him (a claim Morrison always denied). Regional partners Indonesia and Malaysia also expressed fears Aukus could fuel an arms race. China sought to discredit the deal, labelling it an “Anglo-Saxon clique” that would unsettle the region. In February 2022, weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia joined with China in claiming the Aukus deal posed “serious risks of nuclear proliferation”. Despite criticising the then Coalition government’s handling of the diplomacy surrounding Aukus, Labor has stood by the overall policy, and now that it is in government has overseen the final stages of the planning. Mead has been at the centre of that planning. He agreed to an interview with the Guardian in the days leading up to the big announcement, in part to explain the motivations for the submarine plan, and to reassure regional partners about Australia’s commitment to nuclear safety. He says the Indo-Pacific region has become more complex, more fragile and less stable over the past five years, and this has driven the change of approach. Mead made no criticism of Australia’s existing six Collins class submarines, describing these as the most advanced conventional submarines in the world and saying they play an important role in deterrence. “But going forward, there was a realisation that we did need an advanced capability,” said Mead, who prior to his current appointment oversaw the sensitive review that led to the Coalition’s decision to scrap the French contract. ‘Apex predator’ “Nuclear-powered submarines enable you to remain undetected, you can patrol around the homeland, you can deploy further afield. They have great speed and stealth and firepower,” Mead said. “Their primary role is to defend Australia, protect our people, safeguard our economic prosperity. I would say investing in this capability is future-proofing the way of life of Australia.” Mead says the submarines aim “to deter anyone seeking to do harm to Australia” given that the country is heavily reliant on international trade and underwater telecommunications. “Nuclear-powered submarines place really the single greatest question mark in an adversary’s mind,” Mead said. “If deterrence fails, they can respond with massive firepower.” The Nine newspapers, in a deeply reported feature about the Aukus deal published in the lead-up to the 2022 election, said the “transformational power of nuclear-propelled subs is that they could allow Australia to pose a direct threat to the Chinese mainland”. When this line was put to him, Mead did not directly comment on it. But he added that nuclear-powered submarines were “called the apex predator of the oceans”. “They’re the most formidable defence capability one can procure,” Mead said. Transparent oceans? In addition to concerns about how long it might take for Australia to begin operating nuclear-powered submarines – the late 2030s or early 2040s have frequently been at the centre of speculation – other potential issues have been aired publicly. The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines. The report suggested that oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. Mead said this issue had been taken into account. “We have done a lot of work with our own science organisations, but with our partners as well in looking at what are the vulnerabilities of submarines.” One option is that a submarine serves as a “mothership” from which other uncrewed underwater technology could be dispatched. “I clearly see a role for uncrewed underwater vehicles operating in the 2050s, probably the 2040s, too,” Mead said. “Those uncrewed underwater vehicles could be operated from the nuclear-powered submarine and could be dispatched at multiple chokepoints and working in conjunction with the nuclear-powered submarine.” Safety concerns Mead also wants to assure Australia’s friends across the region – and the population at home – that nuclear safety will be the “paramount” consideration as the three governments put the plan into practice. “We’re going to leverage off the incredible safety record of our US and UK partners,” he said. “They have managed over 500 nuclear reactors over the past 60 years, their submarines have travelled 240m kilometres without a nuclear reactor safety incident – that’s 300 times to the moon and back. “We in Australia have hosted about 280 visits by nuclear-powered warships and submarines.” Mead said the Aukus project depends on “establishing an ecosystem – that we can build a workforce that is aware, confident, and in some aspects, experts in nuclear technology”. “It’s developing navy crews, it’s developing a management system that always has safety at the foremost of its considerations.” Australia also needs to show it can be trusted to protect US military technology. The US has only once before shared its naval nuclear propulsion tech, with the UK in the late 1950s. Mead confirms the recent designation of the Osborne shipyard in South Australia as a critical infrastructure asset – first revealed by Guardian Australia – is part of a broader effort to assure Australia’s Aukus partners that their secrets will be protected. He says part of the Osborne shipyard will be a licensed nuclear facility. “It will have the crown jewels of US and UK technology. So we will really have to put in very high standards of security.” Frenzy of activity Mead said there had been a lot of site visits from US and UK officials to shipyards in South Australia and Western Australia, while Australian officials have also conducted site visits in the US and the UK. “What we’re beginning to put together now is what is the best trilateral way that we deliver the submarine,” he said. The leaders’ announcement next week won’t mark the end of Mead’s taskforce’s work. It will switch focus to actually delivering the project and ensuring the governance arrangements to make it a success. “Whilst the announcement next week will not be a shock for us, our job now is to get on and to deliver this program,” Mead said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/oct/14/forget-sportswashing-qatar-2022-is-about-military-might-and-hard-sports-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T16:00:41Z","webTitle":"Forget ‘sportswashing’: Qatar 2022 is about military might and hard sports power | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/oct/14/forget-sportswashing-qatar-2022-is-about-military-might-and-hard-sports-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/oct/14/forget-sportswashing-qatar-2022-is-about-military-might-and-hard-sports-power","fields":{"bodyText":"We need a new word for this thing. Psychologists have sometimes used the phrase “semantic satiation” to describe the process where saying the word “woodpecker” 20 times in a row, or sitting in a circle reciting the phrase “straight-leg easy-fit chinos” will eventually strip those sounds of any meaning, as though the entire concept of straight-leg easy-fit chinos has suddenly ceased to exist. Something like this has happened to the word “sportswashing”. This was always a hopeful coinage, adopted on the hoof to describe governments or other entities that use elite sport as a propaganda tool. Years of heavy use, first by Azerbaijani human rights activists, then Amnesty International, then by the news and sports pages, have left it looking a little baggy. By now sportswashing has been adopted among apologists as a kind of internet eyeroll, with a vague sense it belongs in the same company as “wokery”, or having feelings or taking offence at an emoji. Here they come. The bleeding hearts. The liberals. The dispossessed and the dead. How serious can something with “washing” in its name really be? You have to hand it to Qatar 2022. The opening game is just over a month away and still every question, from what words to use, to Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s confusing early-season squad-bolt as an ambling central pivot, leads you back to the same basic ground. Why is the World Cup happening in Qatar anyway? We still don’t have a clear answer. The consequences and related causes have been examined in granular detail, from Fifa corruption, to human rights abuse to the vainglorious ambition of the hyper-rich. But there is still a blank at the heart of this vast, onerous enterprise; an absence of any real notion of why. Maybe some numbers will help. This week the last of 200 Royal Air Force personnel were deployed to Qatar’s Dukhan airbase, part of Project Thariyat, a joint World Cup-veiled security mission. Did anyone notice back in 2020 that the RAF had formed a joint air force squadron with Qatar, the only joint squadron with anyone since the second world war? But then Qatar also has 24 shiny new British Typhoon jets and Hawk Mk167s. And this is not a private party. Welcome to Qatar 2022, where the world comes together, and does so seriously tooled up. Expect Amazing. Expect to be part of a vast geopolitical security operation. Qatar has 3,250 Turkish security officers. Qatar has South Korean military specialists teaching “close combat skills”. Qatar has Nato looking after chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. Qatari airspace is policed by Kronos radar, Electronic Warfare Compact Airborne Threat Surveyor, the Transmission Data Link SkyDome and the famed DroneHunter attack system. Qatar has 36 US F-15QA fighter jets and 24 US Apache helicopter gunships. Qatar has 28 NH90 helicopters from Italy, and 36 Rafales and two A330 MRTT aerial refuelling planes from France. Qatar has the eyes of the world. Qatar has the Glastonbury spider. Qatar has David Beckham. And quite clearly in this company the World Cup is a weapon too. The Glastonbury spider is a weapon. David Beckham is a weapon. Perhaps you thought Beckham was simply a tool, or an instrument. But he is also a weapon, and a massive weapon judging by his price tag. It feels like stating the obvious, but sometimes the obvious has to be stated. What this World Cup is really about is security. Not trying to be liked, or putting on a face for concerned liberals in economically challenged corners of western Europe. Qatar doesn’t need to be liked, or to diversify into packaged golfing holidays. Qatar has 200 years of natural gas. Absurdly rich and absurdly small, Qatar wants to be visible on the map. This is not sportswashing. This is Hard Sports Power. And in the end we in the are simply bystanders, suppliers, accessories. It helps to get a little perspective. Qatar declared independence from Britain only in 1972. As a modern self-governing state it’s younger than Gareth Southgate. The years either side of the World Cup bid have been dotted with talk of coups and the Gulf cold war that is the real reason Qatar has such a vast military presence. The context here is a regional map that reads like the end of the world reinterpreted through a bloodstained Jane Austen drama. Qatar and Iran are friends. Saudi Arabia hates Iran. The United Arab Emirates hates Iran. Qatar and Saudi are pretending, for now, not to hate each other. Everyone hates Israel, apart from the US, which likes Israel while trying to maintain relations with everyone else who doesn’t. Saudi is on-off with the US but kind of likes Russia and China. China can like anyone who seems useful. Russia laughs darkly at the notion of liking things, while seeking relations with those who can serve its historic destiny to become the new Rome. In the middle of this, tiny, rich, vulnerable Qatar is out there on its peninsula staging history’s greatest show and taking daily calls from world leaders as war in Europe has created power and peril around its vast gas wealth. Little wonder the World Cup vibe is a little odd, that even the soft arm of this thing has seemed strangely brutal, from buying Neymar for twice the record fee, blowing up the European transfer market to wave a flag in a moment of border tension; to creating the current toxic inanity around French football’s puppet emperor Kylian Mbappé, spoiled golden child of gas deals, media buyouts and Élysée Palace lunches. Western colonial powers used football like this in the 19th century, as a lure, a tool, a way of marshalling the locals. Perhaps, in an unlikely historical irony, there is an element of this process in reverse now. Either way, as Qatar 2022 looms closer it seems pretty clear that sportswashing has run its course. Count the drones, the radar systems, the jets. This is Hard Sports Power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/11/russian-strikes-knock-out-power-and-water-in-ukraines-kharkiv-region","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T21:05:35Z","webTitle":"Russian strikes knock out power and water in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/11/russian-strikes-knock-out-power-and-water-in-ukraines-kharkiv-region","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/11/russian-strikes-knock-out-power-and-water-in-ukraines-kharkiv-region","fields":{"bodyText":"Russian strikes have knocked out power and water to much of the Kharkiv region, plunging its cities into darkness and cutting power in hospitals in what Ukraine described as an act of “revenge” by Russia for its recent battlefield successes. Over the last few days, Ukrainian forces have recaptured the majority of Russian-occupied territory in the region in a lightning offensive. Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv city, said work was under way to restore power and some areas reported that the electricity was back on around 1am on Monday local time. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential advisers said, however, that a fire was raging at Kharkiv’s number 5 power station. There were also initial reports of blackouts in neighbouring Sumy and Poltava regions as well as in Dnipropetrovsk, potentially affecting millions of civilians. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said power had now been restored. Tymoshenko said two cruise missiles hit critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and firefighters are now on the scene and that electricity should soon be back in vital facilities such as hospitals. “Russians want to leave us without light, water and heat,” said Tymoshenko. Three explosions were heard in Kharkiv city, where the blackout had affected air raid siren. People had to be evacuated from the Kharkiv metro. The Ukrainian air force tweeted that the Russians had launched 11 missiles but most had been destroyed. “This is a mean and cynical revenge of the Russian aggressor for the successes of our army at the front, in particular – in the Kharkiv region,” said Terekhov. “I ask everyone to keep calm.” On his Telegram, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote: “Even through the impenetrable darkness, Ukraine and the civilized world can clearly see that these are acts of terrorists. [They are] deliberate and cynical missile strikes on critical civilian infrastructure. Not military facilities.’’ Zelenskiy confirmed the power was cut off in Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. He also said that parts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions were having problems with power. The regional governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said in a statement: “There is no electricity or water supply in several settlements. Emergency services are working to control fires at the sites that were hit.” The head of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Dmytro Reznichenko, also said on Sunday evening that Russian forces were responsible for blackouts across his region. “Several cities and communities in the Dnipropetrovsk region are without electricity. The Russians hit energy infrastructure. They cannot accept defeat on the battlefield,” he said in a statement online before power was reportedly restored. The head of the eastern Sumy region said that the earlier cuts to electricity and water supplies had affected at least 135 towns and villages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/06/brexit-trump-populists-power-us-republicans-tory-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-07T07:46:24Z","webTitle":"After Brexit and Trump, rightwing populists cling to power – but the truth is they can’t govern | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/brexit-trump-populists-power-us-republicans-tory-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/brexit-trump-populists-power-us-republicans-tory-party","fields":{"bodyText":"The US right has this week been staging a clown show that has had liberals in that country and beyond pulling up a chair and breaking out the popcorn. There has been a karmic pleasure in watching the Republicans who won control of the House of Representatives struggle to complete the most basic piece of business – the election of a speaker – but it’s also been instructive, and not only to Americans. For it has confirmed the dirty little secret of that strain of rightwing populist politics that revels in what it calls disruption: it always ends in bitter factional fighting, chaos and paralysis. We in Britain should know, because Brexit has gone the exact same way. Start with the karma that saw House Republicans gather two years to the day since they sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another: often overlooked in the anniversary recollections of 6 January 2021 is that, mere hours after rioters had stormed the US Capitol, a majority of Republican House members voted to do precisely as the rioters had demanded and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Yet here were those same House Republicans on 6 January 2023, having prevented the smooth transfer of power from one party to another – except this time, the party they were thwarting was their own. It should have been straightforward. Republicans won a narrow majority in the House in November, which gave them the right to put one of their number in the speaker’s chair. The trouble was, while most backed Kevin McCarthy, about 20 rebels did not. By Thursday night, they had gone through 11 rounds of voting – the most since the civil war era – without McCarthy or anyone else winning a majority. The result: deadlock that was only broken after yet more voting rounds on Friday night, and into Saturday. It was a study in incompetence. A party asks the electorate to give them power; they get it and then freeze, unable to take even the first step towards using it. There was no clear political logic to the stalemate. The rebels are devotees of Donald Trump, but McCarthy himself is a tireless Trump sycophant – patronised by the former president as “my Kevin” – who begged for and won the backing of the orange one. The pro-Trump rebels were divided among themselves: one rebuked Trump for sticking with McCarthy, while another voted to make Trump himself speaker. It’s telling that the rebels’ demands were not on policy but on procedure, seeking rule changes or committee seats that would give them more power. Otherwise, they couldn’t really say what they wanted. They succeeded in getting metal detectors removed from the entrance to the chamber, so now people can walk on to the floor of the House carrying a gun, but apart from that, and their hunger to start investigating Democrats, including Joe Biden’s son Hunter, nothing. All this has significance for the year ahead in US politics. For one thing, it’s yet more evidence of the diminishing strength of Trump among Republican leaders, if not yet among the party faithful. For another, if Republicans cannot make a relatively easy decision like this one, how are they going to make the tough but necessary choices that are coming – such as authorising the spending, and debt, required to keep the US government functioning? But its meaning goes far wider. For what’s been on display this week, in especially florid form, is a strain of politics that has infected many democracies, including our own. Its key feature is its delight in disruption, in promising to upend the system. That was the thrust of the twin movements of 2016, Trump and Brexit. Both promised to sweep away the elites, the experts, the orthodoxy – whether in Washington DC or Brussels. They were new movements, but they were drawing on deep roots. Four decades ago both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher cast themselves as radicals daring to shake off the dead hand of the government. So we can hardly be surprised that those who railed against government should be so bad at it. They promised disruption, and that’s what they’ve delivered. In the US it was the chaos of Trump himself, and now a House of mini-Trumps that can’t tie its own shoelaces. In the UK, it looks different: we have a prime minister in Rishi Sunak whose pitch is technocratic competence. But that should not conceal two things. First, the post-2016 Tory party delivered just as much parliamentary turmoil and intra-party division as McCarthy and co served up this week. Whether it was the Commons gridlock of the two years preceding the 2019 election or the psychodrama of the three years after it, Brexit-era Conservatism has proved every bit as unhinged as Trump-era Republicanism. When it comes to burn-it-all-down politics, the Republicans’ craziest wing are mere novices compared with a master arsonist such as Liz Truss. The US and UK are simply at different points in the cycle. Second, even with Sunak in charge, and though painted in less vivid colours, Brexit-era Toryism is just as paralysed as its sister movement in the US. The five-point plan unveiled in the PM’s new year address consisted mostly of the basics of state administration – growing the economy, managing inflation – rather than anything amounting to a political programme. And that’s chiefly because his party, like the Republicans, cannot agree among themselves. Consider how much Sunak has had to drop, under pressure from assorted rebels. Whether it was reform of the planning system, the manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses a year or the perennial pledge to grasp the nettle of social care, Sunak has had to back away from tasks that are essential for the wellbeing of the country. True, he has avoided the farcical scenes that played out this week on Capitol Hill, but that’s only because he has preferred to preserve the veneer of unity than to force a whole slew of issues. The result is a prime minister who cannot propose much more than extra maths lessons lest he lose the fractious, restive coalition that keeps him in office. None of this is coincidence. It’s in the nature of the rightwing populist project, in Britain, the US and across the globe. Brexit is the exemplar, a mission that worked with great potency as a campaign, as a slogan, but which could never translate into governing, because it was never about governing. It was about disrupting life, not organising it – or even acknowledging the trade-offs required to organise it. It offered the poetry of destruction, not the prose of competence. The Conservatives are several stages further down this road than the Republicans, perhaps because their power has been uninterrupted throughout. But in both cases, and others, the shift is unmistakable. Once parties of the right saw themselves as the obvious custodians of state authority: the natural party of government.

Do not read on unless you have watched episode seven. ‘The gods can be cruel’ So the board is set, and the pieces are ready to move. By the end of this episode, entitled Driftmark, we finally have a firm idea how the battle lines will be drawn, and who will face one another across this Westerosi gameboard: two queens, alike in infamy; two pairs of young, feuding princes; two older schemers with their eyes on the ultimate prize. All they are awaiting is the signal to advance. For the first part of this ominous instalment, all anyone seems to do is look. The major players have gathered at the island seat of High Tide for the funeral of Lady Laena Velaryon, and everywhere resentment is simmering. Prince Daemon (Matt Smith) scoffs at the idea that his niece Rhaenyra’s children could be legitimate, while their supposed father Laenor (John MacMillan) stands alone and mourns his sister. Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) blames Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) for the death of her lover, Ser Harwin, but she has no proof and cannot publicly grieve for him. Prince Aemond (Leo Ashton) witnesses the awkward but honest empathy felt by Jacaerys (Leo Hart) towards his motherless cousins, but has no way to express his own inner turmoil. All any of them can do is wait and watch. ‘History does not remember blood. It remembers names’ At the same time, alliances are crystallising, potential partners sounded out, bonds of blood and debts of honour rekindling. Daemon may mock Rhaenyra’s marriage, but he still supports her claim over that of Alicent and her children. The Queen may have been shocked by the brutal patricide committed by the new Lord of Harrenhal, Ser Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), but she knows now that she needs him. Meanwhile, Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best) and her husband, Lord Corlys, (Steve Toussaint) are at an impasse: his instinct is to support his legal grandchildren, whether or not they’re legitimate; she’d rather stay out of it altogether, and give up those old dreams of power. The episode gathered steam when Aemond set out to claim his dragon. Presented last week as a snivelling brat, it turns out the boy has some serious courage, facing down Laena’s erstwhile mount and murderer, the mighty Vhagar. The night flight that follows is giddy and breathless – we half expect the boy to scream out ‘Falkor!’ as Vhagar dives over the rooftops of High Tide – but the aftermath is far grimmer, as Laena’s youngest daughter Rhaena (Eva Ossei-Gerning) accuses Aemond of dragon-theft, and Jacaerys and his brother Lucerys (Harvey Sadler) back her up. The violence that follows is swift and shocking – it is four against one but Aemond holds his ground, throttling Lucerys as he blurts out the truth about the boy’s parentage – which ends up costing him an eye. ‘Bring me the eye of Lucerys Velaryon’ Where’s Rhaenyra while her sons are defending her honour? Down by the shore in the wreck of an old boat with her uncle Daemon, finally consummating an incestuous flirtation that’s been seething since episode one (and thoroughly scotching any fan theories that Daemon was impotent, though that should have been clear last week). Their love scene is quiet and unearthly; a union at once physical, political and strangely, disconcertingly emotional. But on returning to the castle, Rhaenyra finds that everything has changed: Aemond is drenched in blood, and Alicent is out for more. This scene was the dark heart of the episode, the vengeful counterweight to all those silent gazes at the start, as Alicent demanded rough justice and Rhaenyra flatly refused her, proposing that Aemond be ‘sharply questioned’ to find out where he heard the rumour of her sons’ bastardy. Everywhere, lines were being drawn – between Daemon and Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel); between Rhaenyra’s children and those of Alicent and Viserys; even between the brothers Aemond and Aegon, the first of whom was happy to name the latter as the source of the rumour. Most importantly, of course, the decade-long feud between Rhaenyra and Alicent finally came to blows, as daggers were drawn and blood spilled. ‘We are family!’ After all that commotion, the later scenes were oddly cheering. Aemond reaffirmed his bravery – and earned the respect of his grandfather, the returning King’s Hand Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) – by claiming that the loss of his eye was worth it to win Vhagar. After a genuinely moving moment of marital regret and reaffirmation between Leanor and Rhaenyra, she and Daemon cooked up an initially worrying, ultimately rather adorable wheeze whereby the prince consort and his current squeeze Ser Qarl Correy (Arty Froushan) could escape the stultifying trappings of the royal court and head off for lives of adventure in Essos. And finally, Daemon and Rhaenyra tied the knot, in a gorgeously fog-drenched pagan ceremony witnessed by both sets of children – a truly dangerous union, for all who might stand against them. As King Viserys (Paddy Considine) languished below decks on the ship back to King’s Landing, it looked as if he might finally be on the way out, opening the floodgates for all-out war. Still, we’ve assumed that before, and he somehow always seems to pull through. Additional notes • Does Daemon genuinely mourn his wife, as his stilted, bitter conversation with Viserys appears to imply? Or does he just feel resentful and shut out? He tells Rhaenyra that “we were happy enough”, but that’s hardly a ringing endorsement. • It’s fair enough that Paddy Considine wouldn’t necessarily know how to pronounce the word “calumnies”, but surely someone on the set or in the editing room should’ve been able to set it straight? • “I should’ve been there.” “Those should be our house words.” Nice. Nudity count Some minor chest-nuzzling and thigh-stroking aside, it was a rather chaste coupling between Rhaenyra and Daemon – reflective, perhaps, of the high status of both actors. Elsewhere, the most simmering tension in the episode was between Aemond and his new she-dragon, Vhagar. Violence count If looks could kill, the shores of Driftmark would’ve been awash in blood from scene one. But the real violence didn’t come until the halfway point, with that brutal meeting in a tunnel between three groups of kids. There has been preteen brutality in Game of Thrones before – hello, Arya Stark – but the slashing of Aemond’s eye was still a gasp-inducing moment. Random Brit of the week The implication may have been that the show is keeping Laenor Velaryon in its back pocket for later, but my guess is that we’ve seen the last of this sweet, sad character and the actor who so sensitively played him. John MacMillan is a veteran of, well, just about everything, from tiny roles in major blockbusters (The Dark Knight Rises, World War Z), to bigger parts in Chewing Gum and sketch show Famalam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2023/apr/07/essex-mental-health-inquiry-pointless-without-legal-powers-say-families","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T06:00:46Z","webTitle":"Essex mental health inquiry pointless without legal powers, say families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/07/essex-mental-health-inquiry-pointless-without-legal-powers-say-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/apr/07/essex-mental-health-inquiry-pointless-without-legal-powers-say-families","fields":{"bodyText":"Bereaved relatives have said an independent inquiry into the death of almost 2,000 mental health patients across NHS trusts in Essex is not “fit for purpose” in the absence of legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. The call for a statutory inquiry by 83 families comes after the chair of the review, Dr Geraldine Strathdee, published an open letter saying it would “not be able to meet its terms of reference with a non-statutory status”. In the same letter she said the inquiry team had written to 14,000 former or current members of staff at Essex Partnership University NHS trust (EPUT) or its successors and only 11 had replied saying they would give oral evidence. The 83 families, represented by Hodge, Jones and Allen (HJA), are refusing to engage with the inquiry, because they believe there can be no accountability for the deaths of loved ones without greater powers, as evidenced by Strathdee’s letter. Allegations include sexual assault against patients, staff taunting or neglect of patients, improper use of restraint, and patients absconding or being discharged with insufficient care in place. HJA says it has evidence of what would appear to be criminal liability. Lisa Wolff, 51, the mother of Abbigail Smith, who killed herself, aged 26, in February 2021, the day after being discharged from the Linden centre, in Chelmsford, said: “There has to be transparency in these mental health services that are failing. I work in health, I want to welcome the thought that these places can be beacons of hope, that they can be a light in the dark for those people who are like Abbi – who are troubled, who need support – and for families to think: ‘Thank God they’ve gone in, they’re going to get the help they need,’ because right now, we can’t do that. Right now, we’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, they’ve gone in there. What’s going to happen to them?’” She said less than a fortnight before her release and subsequent death, her daughter, who was first sectioned when she was 15, was downgraded from constant observation by two members of staff to no observation. The inquiry, set up in 2021, was originally investigating 1,500 deaths of highly vulnerable people, including children, either while they were inpatients or within three months of discharge. The number has since risesn to almost 2,000. Alan Oxton’s father, Steve, killed himself, aged 53, at the Lakes mental health hospital in Colchester. He said the inquest found failings with respect to not removing a belt from his father on admission, reducing the frequency that he was checked on by staff, and placing him in a room where a ligature could be suspended. Oxton, who has been on antidepressants since his father’s death, said he believed the staff who had come forward were likely to be those with nothing to hide. “Without it being a statutory inquiry it’s pointless, and I’ve never engaged [with it]. The [number of] people they’ve got coming forward is so low, it’s pointless and not fit for purpose.” More staff are said to have come forward since a plea by Strathdee but the number has not been revealed. There are also concerns that failings have not been addressed and suicides have continued. Daisy Simpson, 34, who has been under the care of EPUT since 2009, said: “This is bigger than just one person and the 80 families. There are people on a daily basis that are repeatedly failed and there are no lessons learned. I fear that if I ever ended up back in their inpatient service they would kill me.” The former cabinet ministers John Whittingdale and Priti Patel have called for a statutory inquiry and were among a delegation of six Essex MPs who went to see the health secretary, Steve Barclay, last week to make the case. Whittingdale said Barclay was “very sympathetic” and the government seemed to be moving from a position where it was “very reluctant” to make the inquiry statutory, to acceptance that it “may need to be”. An EPUT spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to learning lessons and improving the care and support offered to those who rely on us in often challenging circumstances. Our sincere apologies go out for the shortfall in care identified here and we continue to fully support the independent inquiry to provide the answers families rightly deserve. We continue to encourage staff to come forward and give evidence as part of this.” The Department of Health and Social Care said the progress of the inquiry was being “carefully considered”, adding: “It is disappointing that current and former staff have not engaged to the extent expected nor that the inquiry has been able to access all the information it has requested.” • This article was amended on 7 April 2023 to correct Daisy Simpson’s first name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/31/us-air-force-deployment-nuclear-capable-b-52-bombers-australia-northern-territory","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T11:55:56Z","webTitle":"US deployment of nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Australia’s north likely to fuel China tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/us-air-force-deployment-nuclear-capable-b-52-bombers-australia-northern-territory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/us-air-force-deployment-nuclear-capable-b-52-bombers-australia-northern-territory","fields":{"bodyText":"An expanded Royal Australian Air Force base in the Northern Territory will have space for up to six American nuclear-capable B-52 aircraft as part of a US-funded project that is likely to fuel tensions with China. Officials in Canberra confirmed that the US-funded aircraft parking apron at RAAF Base Tindal, 320km south-east of Darwin, would be capable of accommodating up to six B-52 aircraft, but said it could also house other aircraft types. They said the project was currently in the design phase, and played down the significance of the development, saying US bomber aircraft had been visiting Australia since the early 1980s and conducting training in Australia since 2005. But the detailed plans – first reported by the ABC on Monday – suggest the new Labor government has locked in plans initiated under the former Coalition government to expand visits to Australia by US aircraft. The B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can carry out ocean surveillance and anti-ship operations and “can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance”, according to a US government summary. Four Corners reported the US Department of Defence had budgeted $US14.4m ($A22.5m) for squadron operations and maintenance facilities at Tindal. It cited US documents as saying: “The [squadron operations] facility is required to support strategic operations and to run multiple 15-day training exercises during the Northern Territory dry season for deployed B-52 squadrons.” The minister for defence personnel, Matt Keogh, said Australia must remain “vigilant” amid regional tensions, but he did not think the B-52 rotation plans would inflame tensions with China. “I don’t think so at all,” he told reporters in Hobart. “I think what’s really important here is that the more we are able to build interoperability with the Americans, growing on that very strong alliance.” Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told reporters at a regular briefing that China “urges the parties concerned to abandon the outdated Cold War and zero-sum mentality and narrow minded geopolitical thinking, and to do something conducive to regional peace and stability and enhancing mutual trust between the countries.” He said defence and security cooperation between countries should “not target any third parties or harm the interests of third parties.” The US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, avoided commenting directly on the B-52 plans on Monday, but said the US was determined to support “peace and stability throughout this region” through diplomacy, dialogue and deterrence. In an interview with ABC News Breakfast, Kennedy said the Indo-Pacific was facing “increasing tensions” and the US would “work with our partners and allies to make this [region] safe”. Former prime minister Scott Morrison revealed in September last year that he expected the US to increase its military presence in the region while Australia awaits nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus deal – the first of which were at that stage expected to be ready by the late 2030s. Senior ministers Peter Dutton and Marise Payne held annual talks with their US counterparts in Washington DC a day after the Aukus announcement, and also flagged plans for more US military deployments to Australia. Dutton said the alliance with the US must be “match-fit to meet the strategic challenges ahead” and announced “greater air cooperation through rotational deployments of all types of US military aircraft to Australia”, including strategic bombers. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at the time that the US and Australia were exploring “greater and more frequent engagement … with our air capabilities, more training opportunities for our ground forces, and increasing our logistical footprint in Australia as well”. Sources in Canberra said on Monday that the new aircraft parking apron was one of many capital infrastructure works aiming to support US force posture initiatives, alongside upgrades to airfields, fuel storage facilities, accommodation and training areas. The Australian government believes the project will boost Australia’s capacity to train with and host international partners, because it also provides functionality for Australian defence force use and could also host other aircraft types. US bomber aircraft have been visiting Australia for decades, but the launch of an enhanced air cooperation program in early 2017 signalled a determination by both governments to ensure their air forces could operate together seamlessly. The new details of the project are likely to trigger a reaction from the Chinese government. Chinese state media have previously quoted domestic analysts as saying Australia could “essentially become an overseas bomber base of the US”. While the Albanese government has sought to “stabilise” the relationship with China through a change in “tone” and several ministers have now met with their counterparts, Canberra’s fundamental defence posture remains as it did under the Coalition. Earlier this month the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, signed a new security declaration with his visiting Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, to deter “aggression and behaviour that undermines international rules and norms”. The deal commits Australia and Japan to consult each other on how to respond to regional crises, and is expected to pave the way for greater sharing of intelligence and strategic assessments about China’s intentions. Albanese and Kishida have both called for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and raised concerns about China’s activities in the South and East China seas. China’s president, Xi Jinping, told the 20th Communist party congress this month that he would never rule out the use of force to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that he regards as central to his promise to achieve “national rejuvenation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/kyiv-urges-west-to-spell-out-how-it-would-respond-to-russian-nuclear-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T17:15:10Z","webTitle":"Kyiv urges west to spell out how it would respond to Russian nuclear strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/kyiv-urges-west-to-spell-out-how-it-would-respond-to-russian-nuclear-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/kyiv-urges-west-to-spell-out-how-it-would-respond-to-russian-nuclear-strike","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukrainian officials have called on world leaders to issue a firm warning to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, making it clear that any attempt to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine would result in catastrophic consequences for Russia. “The other nuclear states need to say very firmly that as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes on foreign territory – in this case the territory of Ukraine – there will be swift retaliatory nuclear strikes to destroy the nuclear launch sites in Russia,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in an interview at the presidential administration in Kyiv. On Wednesday, Russian television aired an address by Putin in which he demonstratively played the nuclear card. The Russian president also announced “referendums” in four partially occupied regions of Ukraine, on the question of the territories joining Russia, and declared partial mobilisation. “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal… It’s not a bluff,” said Putin. Since February, Putin has made nuclear threats several times, but Wednesday’s was the most clear and explicit to date, and has left analysts scrambling to determine whether the possibility Putin could resort to nukes is real or just a bluff. “I think the analytical capacity of Putin’s circle is very low at the moment – they don’t understand all the risks of what they are doing and where it has already brought the Russian Federation,” said Podolyak. “It’s hard to make predictions when a person is completely irrational.” It is unlikely that western leaders will heed Ukrainian calls for direct retaliatory threats, but Podolyak said letting Russia get away with nuclear threats would erode the long-standing principle that nuclear weapons can only be used defensively when the survival of a country was at stake. “We have a big country that enters Ukrainian territory, starts a war, seizes some territory, and then says this territory is now ours and if you try to take it back we’ll use nuclear weapons. It looks absolutely absurd, and furthermore it destroys the whole global system of nuclear deterrence,” said Podolyak. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Putin’s threats should be taken seriously, but added that much would depend on how the west responded. “You can’t have someone wandering around with a grenade with the pin removed and threatening everyone with it just because he can,” she told the Guardian. Vereshchuk also called on western politicians to spell out to Putin what pursuing the nuclear option would mean in practice. “There should be a firm ultimatum to Russia with what will happen. Up to now, there hasn’t been… We need it to be seriously and clearly articulated. They understand only force, and only asymmetrical force,” she said, however she declined to say exactly what she believed the West should threaten. As world leaders gathered in New York for the UN general assembly, many have condemned Putin’s invasion, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who described the Russian attempt to occupy Ukraine as “a return to the age of imperialism”. On Wednesday, the US president, Joe Biden, told the assembly Putin’s invasion had “shamelessly violated” the UN charter, and said his nuclear threats showed “reckless disregard” for the responsibilities of a nuclear state. However, there is no sign yet of any leader willing to issue threats of nuclear retaliation to Putin. On the ground, Russia continued its bombardment of Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, firing a series of long-range missiles at Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, in the early hours. The city has been regularly hit since the start of Russia’s invasion in February, but is now out of artillery range, following Ukraine’s stunning counter-offensive earlier this month. Russian troops abandoned their positions and retreated across the border. On Wednesday, at least one missile struck a high-rise apartment in the western Zalutino district. It gouged a hole out of the top of the building and blew out windows in apartments facing onto a grassy square. Ten residents were injured. Resident Yevgeniy Subota, whose apartment was damaged by the blast, dismissed Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the event of his defeat in Ukraine: “It’s bluff. We don’t believe it. There would be a reaction from the US. He’s just trying to scare us.” Preparations are also under way for the so-called “referendums”, due to take place this weekend in the parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions controlled by Russia. It is not clear how the Kremlin plans to provide even the smallest semblance of legitimacy for the votes, which will take place amid an active military conflict, with much of the population displaced and large parts of the area claimed by Russia still under Ukrainian control. In Kyiv, officials promised to pay no attention to the “referendums”, and said they would have no influence on the ongoing Ukrainian counterattack. In his nightly address on Tuesday, Zelenskiy described the plans as “noise” and said Ukrainian authorities and the country’s armed forces would ignore Russia’s declarations. Vereshchuk described the referendums as a “pathetic attempt” by Putin to provide justification to the Russian people for the ongoing invasion. “It’s for the internal audience to explain why there have been so many losses. I don’t think your average Russian Ivan from Ivanovo really understands why his son died somewhere in a village in Kherson region,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T16:35:02Z","webTitle":"Who will fund Sizewell C nuclear plant and when will it be built? | explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson is poised to sign off as prime minister by giving the green light for a new nuclear reactor costing up to £30bn. The decision to offer funding for the Sizewell C in Suffolk, in his final week in Downing Street, is expected to unlock significant private funding for the project after years bogged down in planning approvals. However, it would come after Johnson promised not to make any major spending decisions before leaving office. Here is the state of play. What is Sizewell C? The power station is planned to sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast. When complete, it is estimated the 3.2 gigawatt plant will be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. Sizewell C is expected to plug a gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities – most UK plants will be shut by 2030. Sizewell B is due to close in 2035, although its lifetime may be extended. How is it going to be funded? The plans were originally developed by France’s EDF, which holds an 80% stake in the project, and the Chinese state-backed nuclear power company CGN, which has a 20% holding. However, ministers are keen to avoid further Chinese involvement in UK nuclear sites amid worsening relations between Britain and China. CGN holds a stake in Hinkley Point C – the delayed and over-budget Somerset plant upon which plans for Sizewell are based. The UK government and EDF are expected to each take a 20% stake, while bankers at Barclays have been tasked by officials with finding investors for the remainder. Pension and infrastructure specialist funds are seen as the most probable candidates to invest. How much will it cost? Estimates have crept up from £20bn to a current range of £20bn to £30bn. The government will make a final decision on how much taxpayer funds will be put in – thought to be around £6bn – next year. Ministers have already committed £100m to the project and plan to use a so-called “regulated asset base” funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk to encourage their involvement in vital infrastructure deals. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has estimated that taxpayer backing will add an extra £1 a month to household bills. However, research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. The average estimate in the study put the combined cost at £35bn, or £2.3bn a year. When will it be built? The site is a crucial pillar in Johnson’s plan to green-light eight new nuclear reactors over the next eight years. However, the approval process has suffered multiple delays. The progress of Hinkley Point C – which earlier this year pushed back its opening to June 2027, a decade later than planned – has not provided an encouraging blueprint. The University of Greenwich forecasts predict it will take 15 years to build Sizewell C, or 17 years under its gloomiest forecast, and cost £43.8bn. Greg Clark, the levelling up secretary, this week unveiled proposals designed to speed up the approval of nuclear power stations and off-shore windfarms. The fast-track process will also be applied to major roads and airport runways. What are the objections against Sizewell C? The project has faced opposition on several fronts from critics who say nuclear projects are too slow to build and costly, as well as those concerned over safety and nuclear waste. Campaigners question the track record of the pressurised water reactor proposed for the site and the cost to consumers. Opponents also worry whether local infrastructure is capable of handling a site that could bring 6,000 workers to the area and thousands of extra vehicles. The threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed and risk of coastal erosion and flooding have also been raised. What happens next? A final decision is expected from the government on the project next year. With Johnson’s decision before his departure, the situation has echoes of Hinkley Point C, when Theresa May put the project on hold in 2016 in her first weeks as prime minister amid security concerns. May eventually approved the project and, if Liz Truss is successful in the Tory leadership race, her rumoured chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to be supportive of Sizewell C. However, the process may also be held up by a legal challenge by the Together Against Sizewell C campaign, over planning consent for the plant, which was given against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/fight-the-power-how-hip-hop-changed-the-world-review-chuck-d-is-a-brilliant-history-teacher","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-21T22:00:18Z","webTitle":"Fight the Power: How Hip-Hop Changed the World review – Chuck D is a brilliant history teacher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/fight-the-power-how-hip-hop-changed-the-world-review-chuck-d-is-a-brilliant-history-teacher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/fight-the-power-how-hip-hop-changed-the-world-review-chuck-d-is-a-brilliant-history-teacher","fields":{"bodyText":"There’s almost no hip-hop in the first episode of BBC Two’s new four-part documentary about the genre, a series that labours under the vanilla title Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five only drop The Message in the last five minutes. Instead, we are given an hour-long history lesson on New York City in the 60s and 70s – the decades leading up to hip-hop’s birth. This, however, is the correct approach, and it signals that Fight the Power will treat its subject with the respect and rigour it deserves – not surprisingly, since Chuck D of Public Enemy is an executive producer as well as one of the main interviewees. Any music documentary with ambitions to inform as well as entertain is a trade-off between sociology and musicology: the records say this and sound like that because this is what was happening in the world at the time. In the case of hip-hop, the scene was a more direct response to political circumstances than any popular music before it, and those conditions – black citizens marginalised by racist authorities – have resonance beyond the US and beyond the 20th century. Back we go, then, to 1960, and John F Kennedy promising to improve black Americans’ life chances. By the end of the decade, their leaders were assassinated or imprisoned, their political movements infiltrated and undermined, their family members drafted into the US army and killed in Vietnam, their protests viciously put down. Fight the Power namechecks Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud by James Brown, Is It Because I’m Black by Syl Johnson and Seize the Time by future Black Panther party leader Elaine Brown as evidence of revolutionary spirit coursing through records released in 1969. The 1970s began with The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron prefacing hip-hop by talking, not singing, about black power on records with “revolution” in the title. Fight the Power’s fine roster of contributors – KRS-One, Grandmaster Caz, Melle Mel, Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC, and indeed Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets – recall a decade in which black consciousness continued to rise, boosted by Shirley Chisholm’s run for the presidency in 1972 under the slogan “unbought and unbossed”, and in reaction less to overt state violence and more to administrative oppression. The documentary cites the phrase “a period of benign neglect”, used by one of Richard Nixon’s advisers in a January 1970 memo to the president and taken here as summing up the period when, with social programmes persistently underfunded and the South Bronx bisected by a new expressway that seemed designed to hasten urban decay, richer New Yorkers fled the city’s astronomical crime rates and left the poor black and Hispanic folk to it. Fight the Power’s central observation is that hip-hop comes from a community that has been abandoned. The New York police, no longer minded to intervene in poor neighbourhoods, happily allowed hundreds of working-class youths to attend block parties, at which a generation that hadn’t had the money to buy or learn to play instruments made a new kind of music by setting up two turntables, so that a funky horn motif from one record could be segued into a tight drum break from another. The documentary makes the point that one of hip-hop’s most important influences wasn’t musical: at the end of the 70s, no effort was made to stop graffiti covering every inch of the New York subway, so spray-painted slogans and art became an ocean of protest and propaganda, impenetrable to some observers but vital as a form of expression for artists and activists with no other outlet. Graffiti was, in other words, exactly what hip-hop lyrics would soon become, and was one of the four phenomena – along with rap, breakdance and DJing – brought together by DJ Kool Herc, credited here as hip-hop’s great pioneer. Then, as the 80s began, Ronald Reagan campaigned for the presidency by visiting the Bronx – we see him verbally jousting with angry residents in the rubble – and promising more federal aid, before gaining power and instead beginning the further systematic redistribution of wealth from poor to rich. Conditions are now perfect for a fierce new genre of music to take hold, as Chuck D explains: “Hip-hop is creativity and activity that comes out of the black neighbourhood when everything has been stripped away.” And so we arrive at 1982 and The Message, with its eerily contemporary lyrics (“Got a bum education, double-digit inflation / Can’t take a train to the job, there’s a strike at the station”). The story of hip-hop itself – some of the greatest American pop music ever made – begins next week. We’re ready."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/live/2022/oct/23/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-power-of-the-doctor-bbc-centenary-special-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T21:08:20Z","webTitle":"The Power of the Doctor: Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor Who finale – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2022/oct/23/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-power-of-the-doctor-bbc-centenary-special-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2022/oct/23/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-power-of-the-doctor-bbc-centenary-special-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Ok, that’s a wrap from me. The comments will be open for a little while yet. Let me just leave you with some final words from Jodie Whittaker at the premiere of The Power of the Doctor about her time on the show: It’s a really big deal to me that where people work is a happy space. And we couldn’t have asked for a happier space. We were around an extraordinary crew who made us laugh every day, who worked so hard in every department, and then the cast, everybody that came on put heart and soul into it. But I think the main thing is I got to hang out with [Mandip Gill] every day. And I don’t get to do that now. It was such a joy. You can’t describe what it’s like knowing you’re in the best time of your life. Like it’s such a weird thing. And we knew it. We knew it from the first week of filming. It’s been the most special time, I’m not even slightly embarrassed about it, it’s been the most special time. And I got to do it side by side with friends and made friends for life. This family grows, and it’ll be bigger than us, and it’ll go on, and Ncuti will be extraordinary, and he will bring an audience that we haven’t reached, and his performance will be so magical, and now we get to sit back and enjoy it as the fans that we can be now, knowing that whatever is to come, we were once a part of that. Thank you so much for joining me on the live blog, I really appreciate the opportunity and the time people spend reading it, and I will see you again somewhere on the Guardian website soon. Also fairplay to the people at the BBC and the Radio Times for being committed to keeping details secret. At one point this week the Radio Times had a delightfully ambiguously titled article: Doctor Who stars reveal how Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison reacted to return In it, Janet Fielding said: I’ve seen Peter, and I don’t think gloating is a very attractive thing to do, but there are times when you just have to. We are great mates. But we do spend a lot of time trying to take the mickey out of each other. And Sophie Aldred said: Sylvester was delighted — he was one of the first people to text me. He’s an emoji king, so there were loads of little symbols and ‘Congratulations, I can’t wait to see it’. Neither let it slip how it was going to play out. “Guess that’s me done. See you around” Are those going to go down as Jo Martin’s final words as the Doctor on television? We already have some Fugitive Doctor audio adventures to look forward to from Big Finish though. When they announced she would be doing them, Jo Martin said: “Big Finish do amazing work – they are a vital part of the fandom. I’m over the moon to be joining this iconic show. I can’t wait to see what stories they have in store for the Fugitive Doctor.” The BBC say “The next Doctor, played by Ncuti Gatwa, will then take control of the Tardis, with his first episode airing over the festive period in 2023”. 🎅🎄 Over the years people have often talked about the off-screen camaraderie between Jon Pertwee and Roger Delgado as Doctor and Master. At the premiere, Sacha Dhawan was positively gushing about working with Jodie Whittaker. He said: I can say to Jodie, because I’ve said it in interviews, but never said it to Jodie herself but she is one of … well … the best actress I’ve ever worked with. And that’s not just because of her acting ability, it is the fact that she is one hell of a company leader. And it’s really hard to explain this – any actors will understand it – because playing the Doctor is a huge responsibility. She’s in every scene. She has so much dialogue that changes and she welcomes – I just I’ve never seen it – she welcomes every actor, no matter how big or small their part is, with open arms. I was incredibly nervous, and to have someone knocking on your door saying ‘mate, get in my trailer’. I mean, I’ve worked with Jodie on an ITV show years ago, we got to know each other a bit, but on this I got to see this amazing human being who is just absolutely brilliant, and people should know that, because obviously she’s an amazing actress, but she is incredible. I couldn’t be more proud to have done scenes with her. The BBC have put out a press release following the episode, with a quote from Russell T Davies, who says: If you thought the appearance of David Tennant was a shock, we’ve got plenty more surprises on the way! The path to Ncuti’s Fifteenth Doctor is laden with mystery, horror, robots, puppets, danger and fun! And how is it connected to the return of the wonderful Donna Noble? How, what, why? We’re giving you a year to speculate, and then all hell lets loose! THE FIFTEENTH DOCTOR. HE SAID IT! The press release also says “The three special episodes will transmit in November 2023 as Doctor Who celebrates its 60th anniversary.” It was lovely to see Bonnie Langford earlier, and we have seen reunited with her Doctor in the Blu-Ray trailer for Season 24. The BBC have just dropped a publicity image of that final scene. I wonder if there may be some chatter on social media about one particular living past Doctor not featuring tonight. It struck me that Chibnall may have consciously decided to pick all the Doctors who did not feature in Day of the Doctor – assuming that Eccleston has no interest in reprising the role on TV – but I should imagine that health and/or availability may have been a factor as well. Tom Baker is still very active in the world of Doctor Who, but has been looking increasingly frail I’m afraid to say. After the premiere screening, which was in Bloomsbury in London on 11 October, there was a Q&amp;A panel, and this is how Chris Chibnall summed up the whole thing, by saying he really wanted to layer it in with “my love of Doctor Who, and just do those kinds of references to the past, and pack it full of easter eggs.” He went on to say: “I mean the amount of surprises we have been keeping, and the amount of secrets we have been keeping for a very long time, it feels like a relief to see them up there. It’s so long ago now. But it had to be big. It had to be epic. It had to be emotional. And it had to have lots of golden threads back to the past. And to see William Russell as Ian Chesterton going right back to the first ever episode of Doctor Who, you know that a lot of people work very hard to make all of those things happen.” Jodie Whittaker ended her time as Doctor Who in a feature-length episode that was crammed with special guests and returning cameos, with a towering performance by her nemesis the Master, and a smattering of showpiece showdowns with Daleks and Cybermen. And then we got David Tennant – and Ncuti Gatwa! “I secretly implanted a holographic chip in your shoulder and that explains why we look older” might have been a clumsy plot device, but the scenes that saw 1980s Doctors Peter Davison and Sylvester McCoy resolve differences and reconnect with their now older 1980s companions Tegan and Ace was both overt fan service but genuinely touching. Sacha Dhawan’s Master stole the show though. Whether it was the gif-able Boney M Rasputin dancing scene, his Doctor cosplay, or his taunting of Unit staff and companions, he positively revelled in being centre of attention and had all the best lines. It would be a shame if we’ve seen the back of him on-screen. In advance an episode that promised a regeneration, Daleks, Cybermen, the Master, Vinder, Ace, Tegan and Kate Stewart felt like even over 90 minutes it would be a struggle to fit it all in, and yet even more ingredients had been held back. It was nice to get a little bit more of Jo Martin in a role that she excelled at when actually given screentime. And what about William Russell eh? For the BBC’s centenary they bought back one of the original stars from 1963. Russell may have only had one line, but what a delightful recognition of how it was the cast and crew who made that fledgling programme 59 years ago who did so much to establish it as a success that will continue into its sixth decade. Just don’t think too hard about how well the Master’s evil plan hung together. Sum it up in one sentence? The Master steals the show as show as a host of familiar faces turn up to send off Whittaker’s era in style. Life on board the Tardis There was an extremely abrupt and early exit for Dan (John Bishop) who had appeared in some pre-publicity for the episode but clearly hadn’t been around to film much of it. At least Chibnall remembered that he’d previously shrunk his house to nothing. Yaz (Mandip Gill) did not get her happy ending with the Doctor, or even a kiss. There will be some fans you suspect who will argue that the whole “Yaz fell in love with the Doctor and the Doctor wanted to reciprocate but wouldn’t” plot thread has not been handled completely brilliantly, and has ended up being a bit of a bolted on tease. Fear factor Sacha Dhawan’s Master always seems most ominous when at his peak charming and normal - the lecture theatre full of tissue compressed seismologists showed him at his most calmly unhinged. The Daleks were a bit part here, and Ashad remains the only Cyberman that can shoot straight when needed. The scene where the Cybermen were bursting through the walls to get at Tegan managed to exploit a fear of falling and a fear of enclosed spaces at the same time, and was a highlight. Perhaps the biggest fear is someone having to explain why the Earth’s volcanos are now frozen steel and that doesn’t have long-term consequences. Deeper Into The Vortex Boney M’s Rasputin joins a select band of contemporary music appearing in Doctor Who. The Master sang along to Scissor Sisters in Last of the Time Lords, while Foxes sashayed to Don’t Stop Me Now in Mummy On The Orient Express. Still the best music gags though are Britney Spears Toxic being introduced as “a traditional ballad” in The End of the World in 2005, and Vicky observing a clip of the Beatles in The Chase in 1965 and saying “They are marvellous! But I didn’t know they played classical music!” On screen we only ever saw happy partings with the Seventh Doctor and Ace in both Survival - “Come on, Ace, we’ve got work to do!” and at the end of Dimensions in Time. Expanded media have had Ace and the Doctor go their separate ways under duress in several different unpleasant ways. That’s why the McCoy-Aldred scene was partially framed as forgiveness and reconciliation. The Master asks after Tegan’s Auntie Vanessa. He killed her in 1981 episode Logopolis. Kate Stewart has become an expert at avoiding conversion. The controversial CyberBrig managed to save her during Death in Heaven. The Master’s Tardis is a type 75. The Doctor has a Type 40, which was mentioned for the first time in The Deadly Assassin in 1976, the story which also introduced for the first time the idea that Time Lords could only regenerate twelve times. A snap verdict on the Chibnall era With The Halloween Apocalypse, War of the Sontarans, Village of the Angels, Eve of the Daleks and tonight I think in the last twelve months he has significantly improved the ratio of decent episodes to clunkers in his tenure, which has always looked great, but has sometimes felt like a chore to watch rather than a joy. Eras of Doctor Who are often looked back on more fondly than they were received at the time, and Chibnall managed to sign off tonight with a special that exuded warmth, fun, had some lovely throwbacks to nearly six decades of the show’s history, which I think will help gloss his reputation over time, and I would shamelessly give tonight’s episode five stars if I could work out how to add review stars to a live blog. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ And next time There’s nothing officially confirmed, but we expect there to be one, two or possibly three 60th anniversary specials next year, at least one of which features Tennant, Tate and Cribbins. When do we see Ncuti? After him saying “Someone tell me what the hell is going on here?” in the trailer that followed, who knows? Who knows. I’m throwing comments open! HOLY MOLY. Well, I was sort of expecting Tennant and “What? What. WHAT?” but I wasn’t expecting the mini trailer to include Ncuti too!!! “The blossomiest blossom. That’s the only sad thing. I want to know what happens next. Right then, Doctor Whoever-I-am-about-to-be. Tag, you’re it.” And there we have it … Jodie Whittaker’s last words as Doctor Who* [*Until she appears in the 70th anniversary special in 2033] Right we are getting to the bit I haven’t seen yet now. Hold on to your hats/horses. Oh what a lovely treat that was too. Dear old William Russell. He’s 97 now. It is 59 years since he first started out with that mild curiosity in a junk yard. And Katy Manning and Bonnie Langford. How absolutely lovely. On the night of the premiere Chris Chibnall and Jodie Whittaker discussed how she came to the shoot on that day, even though she wasn’t required, just to hang out in the green room. She said “to be on set with people that they paved the way for us to be here, is a really emotional thing.” It certainly got me right in the feels, that’s for sure. “Of course she’s OK. She’s the Doctor.” It is Dan, the space train man, back again! It has become a tradition now for the Doctor to give a valedictory speech that sounds just as much as if it is from the actor as the character. Here was Jodie Whittaker’s: A wise person once said to me “goodbyes only hurt because what came before was so special”. And it’s been so special. You, and Graham, and Ryan and Dan. Nobody else got to be us. Nobody else got to live our days. Nobody. And my hearts are so full of love of all of you. I have loved being with you, Yaz. And I have loved being me. Mandip Gill said about that final Tardis scene at the premiere “There wasn’t an awful lot of acting going on. I don’t really cry, I mean it nearly had me there [watching it at the premiere], I might cry. But they were real tears. It was just beautiful, wasn’t it?” “Even when I was watching it, I was like, that’s not acting. That’s actually just me crying. But it was. It was really emotionally beautiful, wasn’t it? And it was written so well, and I wouldn’t have wanted it to end any other way. And then the scene on top of the Tardis is just so beautiful. I’m just so grateful that like Jodie said, we’ve started together, and we’ve ended together. I might cry.” I’ve been a big fan of both Yaz as a character and Mandip Gill as an ambassador for the show. One thing I must say as well is that obviously I have been lucky enough to go to the press previews and events, and the genuine, genuine warmth between the people working on the show over the last few years – however well it has been received by fans and *cough* ultra-critical Guardian reviewers – has been a joy to behold. Croydon is where the Doctor said he had dropped off Sarah Jane Smith at the end of The Hand of Fear. We later find out in School Reunion that it was actually Aberdeen he’d dropped her in. “Right. That’s next to Croydon, isn’t it?” the tenth Doctor said. Oh mate Can confirm Colin Baker is not enjoying his return to Doctor Who right now Of course the Master isn’t dead. How could he ever be? Yaz carrying the Doctor there just like CyberBill did in The Doctor Falls. And then the faces of the companions in that scene just like everyone had gathered around Tom Baker at the end of Logopolis, which also, of course, featured Janet Fielding. Very deliberate echoes in the directorial choices from Jamie Magnus Stone and Chris Chibnall’s writing here. Last time we saw Vinder, his partner Bel was heavily pregnant, and the Doctor had foisted Karvanista on them, and lots of people were furious on social media because they had convinced themselves during the course of Flux that Vinder and Bel were going to turn out to be the Doctor’s parents. And they turned out to be … just a random couple in love expecting a baby who got caught up in the story. This has made me laugh too THE GOGGLES! Kate Stewart there channelling her dead’s absolute bafflement the first time he actually set foot in the Tardis too. Ace’s incompetence with setting timers on her explosives were a bit of a running joke on the series during the 1980s. I’m not entirely clear on the science there of “you press two buttons and pull out one lead and then all the Cybermen get fried” but let’s just roll with it. Tom Baker’s Doctor once averted a neutron star exploding by getting a giant metal-exuding talking plant to wrap it in an aluminium shell so, y’know, the science isn’t always strong with this one. “What am I wearing?” – it looks great on you Jodie. I’m 100% convinced that awkward line about the Fugitive Doctor being a tour guide in Gloucester last time Yaz saw her got added in at the read-through when Mandip Gill or Jo Martin pointed out it was the first scene they’d had together since Fugitive of the Judoon. I will not be persuaded otherwise. Vinder justifying his entire presence in the story there by being the surprise. Cue the volcanoes. I wonder whether Chibnall was deliberately trying to channel those bits of old seventies Who in stories like Inferno where they’d suddenly break into stock footage of volcanoes or space rockets taking off or something? Ashad has been so much better than any of the Cyberleaders during the post-2005 run of Who, hasn’t he? A Cyberman, but with real menace and some unpredictability. He has been a highpoint of every episode he has featured in for me. Some lovely reactions to those scenes coming in: Not sure in fairness I can disagree with this so far though … “Friend of the Doctor. Former bus driver. Worried about the amount of Daleks in here.” Superb surprise entrance there – I mean it was heavily rumoured that Bradley Walsh had been seen filming in Cardiff – but that was a great leftfield twist. Although that “never on the first date” line is going to spark a load of fan fiction about Ace and Graham that I never want to read. It is interesting to me that in this scene with Sylvester and Sophie they address the idea that the seventh Doctor and Ace parted on bad terms. On screen we only saw them walking off together at the end of Survival with the much quoted final speech of the regular run of the series: There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, where the sea is asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there’s danger, somewhere there’s injustice, and somewhere else the tea’s getting cold. Come on, Ace, we’ve got work to do! The pair also got the last word in 1993’s Dimensions In Time, (which is 100% official canon by the way): Ace: What did you do to her? Seventh Doctor: Well, there were two time brains in her computer and I used it to propel her into the trap set for me. Ace: So now your other selves are all free? Seventh Doctor: Certainly I, I mean we, are difficult to get rid of. That last line was intended as a barb at the time that the BBC had bought the show back for a charity special just a few years after binning it off, with the same production team and lead cast in place. However, in the expanded media of books, comics and audio dramas, the relationship between Ace and the Doctor has come to a difficult end in many different ways, including her being killed by Jack the Ripper, becoming pregnant with the child of James Dean, and rage-quitting the Tardis on occasions. You can read all about that after the episode in this great blog post from a couple of years back by Jordan Shortman: Ace and her many fates – all the ways Ace left the Tardis “You sort of look like you used to, but not quite” “I could say the same to you” Absolutely perfect. “We could have fun, I am fun”, I just adore Sacha Dhawan in this, hands-on-hip in his question mark Seventh Doctor sweater from Forbidden Planet, with a vegetable clamped to Jodie’s jacket. Not a lot of men can carry off a decorative vegetable. “OK. That’s high. Oh come on, this used to be easy” It isn’t just jumping off buildings with parachute gizmos that gets more difficult as you get older Ace, even just getting out of the bath starts to be a struggle in your fifties. It’s properly good Doctor Who when cyber conversion involves screaming in my book. I very much enjoy how Chibnall has just basically written Tegan here as if over the last 38 years she just gradually morphed into a very angry Janet Fielding. AWKWARD CONTRARIAN CONTINUITY KLAXON: In the special episode that Russell T Davies wrote to say goodbye to the much-missed Elisabeth Sladen – Farewell, Sarah Jane – it was heavily implied that Tegan and Nyssa now lived together in Australia as a couple. Maybe Tegan here just felt Kate Stewart wasn’t ready for that revelation. The air hostess in the early 80s gag was good though. I’m sure we’ve had emergency Doctor Who holograms inside the Tardis before. Also, what price Rose’s explanation to the ninth Doctor in The End of the World that the Tardis shouldn’t just be messing inside her head to do translation without consent, when this version of the Doctor is just popping staticky microchips into people left, right and centre like some intergalactic 5G-vaccine conspiracy theorist’s dream? Also seven and eight bickering about clothes. I love how essentially between them Bob Baker, Dave Martin and Terrence Dicks wrote that Troughton and Pertwee’s Doctors would bicker in The Three Doctors in 1973 – and there’s a lot of chatter that off-screen Pertwee was very worried about being upstaged by his predecessor on what was now his show – and everybody has just run with it ever since. Who else is going to start calling their other selves “Sandshoes and Grandad”? Mind you, you would find a younger version of yourself annoying if you met them, wouldn’t you? How lovely was that? And how well did the BBC keep it a secret? I must confess that when Whittaker first opened her eyes my heart sank a little – “Oh no, here’s one of those trademark Chibnall dreamscape scenes where the Doctor talks exposition to herself for three minutes against a green-screen backdrop.” I mean, it sort of still was, but in the loveliest possible way. This has made me laugh There was a huge cheer went up in the room during the premiere when Sacha Dhawan started cosplaying as 70s/80s Doctors there. I suppose it goes with having Tegan and Ace back too. And then another one for producing the recorder, which Patrick Troughton used to play as the Doctor, chiefly to buy time or annoy people it seemed. That is actually Sophie Aldred’s genuine original jacket which she still had from back in the day. I can’t imagine anything from my 1989 wardrobe would still fit me – apart from socks – so fair play to her. We did also see the jacket again in 2019, when in character as Ace she starred in a scene to promote the release of the Season 26 Blu-Ray box-set. This isn’t the first time the Master has tried to steal the Doctor’s life force. That was almost the entire basis of the plot of the 1996 TV Movie. Dhawan is absolutely stealing this episode for me. He’s brilliant. I nearly made that a key event: Dhawan dances to Boney M and then steals the episode – reports. What an iconic scene for the ages – just how many gifs are we going to get of Sacha Dhawan dancing to Boney M? And that bit where the Dalek and the Cybermen turn to each other. It went down rapturously in the room at the premiere and more than anything I just enjoy it when Doctor Who doesn’t have to be grimdark all the time. The Master has a long history – watching the Clangers or the Teletubbies, John Simm singing along to the Scissor Sisters – of doing very, very silly things. And this one is perfect. The Master says that the Time Lords forced the Doctor to regenerate at least once before. Patrick Troughton’s Doctor was made to regenerate in 1969 story The War Games as a punishment for his meddling. They turned him into Jon Pertwee and exiled him to earth. While also maybe making him carry out a few missions on their behalf while looking a little older – see the Season 6b theory for more details. “Dress for the occasion” – you have to love a good call-back. That was Sacha Dhawan quoting a line from the Master in the 1996 TV Movie, when he suddenly appeared dressed up in Time Lord robes. It has been much mocked over the years for Eric Roberts’ over-the-top delivery. Mandip Gill was asked at the premiere what she had enjoyed most about being on the show, and she said “what I’m most happiest about was being part of the historical episodes, Demons of the Punjab and Rosa. Like, it was such an honour to be part of such pieces, but in this genre, you don’t really see it happening. And I think that was beautifully done, written beautifully. The directing was great, but it just felt so special to be a part of something that I’m really connected to, and that my family could watch, even if they don’t necessarily watch sci fi-shows, there was a connection there, and I am so honoured to be part of those storylines.” Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor has been turned into a Weeping Angel and now trapped in a Dalek casing. Just need a Cyberman-conversion for the Trifecta. As often seems to be the case, unlike Yaz, these Cybermen clearly HAVEN’T had firearms training. Or if they did, they went to the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy. Ashad, on the other hand, is absolutely ruthless. I like him a lot. For a Cyberman. You’ve got to admire the Dalek obsession for tunnelling into Earth and building big blowing-up things. It was their plan back in their second story in 1964 and they can’t let go of the idea. Say what you will about Chibnall’s era, but scenes like this in tunnels in a volcano are a lot better looking than the ones I remember from stories like Planet of Fire or Survival as a kid in the eighties. Not sure why this Dalek doesn’t come equipped with wifi though. Dan Martin used to always refer to Sacha Dhawan as the Hot Camp Master and that “bunk up in the bunker” and “darling, I don’t seem to have the room service menu” scene totally explains why. By the way, Jodie Whittaker was asked at the premiere if she had any advice for Ncuti Gatwa on taking up the role. She said “It’s yours for the taking. It’s yours to own, and you’ve earned it.” She also said, laughing, with regard to more specific advice, “I’m certainly not giving that phenomenal actor any advice. He doesn’t need it from me!” VINDER! At the premiere they revealed that in that scene just gone actually Mandip Gill was struggling to hold up the gun for that long because, as she said, “he had a big speech, I was like ‘this gun is really heavy!’” The crew made what Dhawan described as a “contraption”. Gill said “They ended up making a little stand behind my back and were like ‘Do you want to just balance your arm on there?’” We don’t often get to see Doctor Who companions with guns. At least Yaz gets a line here to confirm that as a police officer she had weapons training. It still remains a huge mystery how Sarah Jane Smith turned out to be a crack shot in 1975 story The Pyramids of Mars, where the plot required her to hit a small target from great distance using an early 1900s hunting rifle. I can assure you that unlike police officers, journalists like Sarah Jane and I do not routinely get antique weapons training. At the premiere of this episode, Sacha Dhawan spoke about his role as the Master, saying “when I first got cast in it, it is so daunting, stepping into Doctor Who, because it is unlike any other job. It is so big. So you are kind of riddled with nerves. And obviously because of the nature of the role as well. But after doing Spyfall, and settling into the show, what people don’t see when you are in it, is just how welcoming the crew is in Cardiff. And that’s primarily because of how Jodie leads the show. And it’s like coming back to a really nice family who encourage you to do the best.” He also said he had wanted to try something a bit new for this episode, saying “it was good [to return], but it is also really nerve wracking as well. Because I think for me, once people had seen the incarnation, I was like I wanted to obviously keep that, but try and reinvent it a little bit, and keep the audience guessing. So in working with Chris [Chibnall] again, he is so collaborative, we had conversations early on about mixing up a bit and really proud of that.” “How did you even escape from Gallifrey?” “Magnificent attention to detail” A hill that I will absolutely die on is that one of the Master’s defining traits is that they always come back from certain death without explanation, and I’m pleased to see that the modern series just outright acknowledges that, whether it was Missy with “Death is for other people, dear” in The Magician’s Apprentice or him right now. Who knew when they finished this episode a year ago that defacing paintings would turn out to be a topical joke, eh? “We used to be you, decades back” That’s a lot of awkwardness in one scene. Loved it. UNIT is back, baby. Chibnall got a lot of flack for saying it had been disbanded as a throwaway Brexit joke the other year. OK, so you can all bin your theories that the child in the box was the Master and Cybermasters intercepting the Doctor and Timeless Child earlier in his/her/its timestream. There’s a sentence to write on a Sunday night. It’s a Quaranx/Coranks/Koroncs. Spell it how you like until the end credits roll. When I saw the pre-publicity pictures, of course I was a bit sceptical about “How can the Master be Rasputin? That re-writes too much history” etc etc, and then just watching Sacha Dhawan using low-level hypnosis on Nicholas II and Alexandra I was immediately “Oh, OK, that makes sense.” “Well … that’s a new one” the Doctor says to the Dalek who is working against the Daleks. Let us all take a pause to think about how “Rusty” must feel about this scene, the “Good Dalek” that was in Into The Dalek and Twice Upon A Time, dedicated to destroying the Daleks and now … forgotten. *SAD_DALEK_EMOJI* Unexpected early companion departure in the baggage area there? I absolutely adored that Ace was in a café for that scene, just like where we met her first on Iceworld in 1987 during Dragonfire, although not a grumpy waitress this time. And a reminder that Tegan met the Cybermen when they killed Adric in Earthshock in 1982, and Ace previously met the Cybermen in 25th anniversary story Silver Nemesis in 1988. Just so you know, if I get through this evening without once typing the name of 1966 Patrick Troughton story The Power of the Daleks by mistake instead of 2022 Jodie Whittaker story The Power of the Doctor it will be a miracle. I’m assuming that this is the last time we get to see this opening sequence and Segun Akinola’s version of the theme tune powering it. OK, so the Cybermen have a child in a box … let the speculation begin! I can’t help feeling those Time Lord frilly bits around the Cybermaster leader’s head would easily snap off and be a nuisance in confined spaces. Just not practical. Dan (John Bishop) saying he’s got a date to get to there. It was nice at the end of Legend of the Sea Devils he got to speak to Diane (Nadia Albina) again. She did seem to quite harshly blame him at the conclusion of Flux for everything that happened to her. Give them their due, the sequences with the Cybermen in Ascension of the Cybermen stalking through their ship, and this sequence here, are some of the best the Cybermen have ever looked on-screen in the Nu Who era. Whatever you think of the Timeless Children finale, the idea of Cybermen that simply refuse to die is fundamentally a game-changer for their usually quite terrible plans for galactic domination. I’ve got a nine year old, and it is the one thing he keeps coming back to from recent years if we ever talk about Doctor Who: “What about those Cybermen that can regenerate!” Here we go. Doctor Who. BBC Centenary special. Dun-de-dun. Dun-de-dun. Dun-de-dun-Kklak! OooOOO-WEEEEEE-OOOOooooooh oh no hang on we’ve started on a space train. There is a pre-credits sequence. Sorry, ignore me. Before we start, I just want to raise a glass to the memory of Dan Martin. The popularity of these Doctor Who episode-by-episode recaps on the Guardian website is entirely down to how brilliantly he started them – way back with Matt Smith’s debut The Eleventh Hour in 2010 right through to The Timeless Children in 2020. How time flies. I’ve had huge shoes to fill. I miss Dan very much, and I know the regulars in the comments under the recaps do too. I faithfully promise not to spoiler anything here until it has been broadcast in the UK, but the Master has given his instructions – if you aren’t watching and want to avoid spoilers from hereon in, you need to get off the internet. Comments will open on this live blog once the episode has finished broadcasting in the UK. As well as working on our quiz together, Beth Axford wrote this for the Guardian this week, about how the first female Time Lord changed Doctor Who forever: After 12 male actors, it was a huge deal when Whittaker became the Doctor. There was, inevitably, a backlash. Change can be scary for those who are used to seeing something that has always embodied their own lives. But the negativity doesn’t compare with the positives that have come from diversification. “As much as I have loved Doctor Who my whole life,” says the writer Juno Dawson, “there was a subliminal message running across the first 50 years: men are the central character and women are the ‘assistant’, ‘companion’. As such, having a woman as the Doctor was a huge cultural moment. Little girls can see that women are heroic, they’re important, and they’re fearless. Women’s stories must get the same capital as those about men.” It is not just Whittaker’s casting that marked big changes for the show. Mandip Gill became the Doctor’s first full-time Asian companion, whose character Yaz was revealed to be in love with the Doctor during this year’s New Year special, Eve of the Daleks – the first queer relationship between the Doctor and a companion. This resonated with fans all over the world. Helena Emmanuel, a Doctor Who fan based in the US, says: “When Yaz described that she hadn’t admitted her feelings towards the Doctor even to herself, it resonated with me. I had that exact moment with myself when I was first coming out, not too far from Yaz’s age, and hadn’t ever seen a coming out on TV that felt so similar to my own.” You can read more from Beth Axford here: How the first female Time Lord changed Doctor Who forever I’m not suggesting that Sophie Aldred is better value than me for chatting after the programme finishes tonight, but she is doing a Zoom call at 9.15pm UK time when the episode has finished, whereas I’ll just be giving it large in the comments here. Tickets for that chat have sold out, I understand, but I was lucky enough to get to speak to her earlier in the year for this piece about the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie, so I got to hear first-hand already from her what it meant to be back on the show. She also told the audience at the London premiere of The Power of the Doctor how she got the call: My agent called and said Andy Pryor has been in touch – the casting director – asking for your availability, and we all know what that means. And I ended the phone call and just burst into tears. It was, I think, the call that probably all of us have been waiting for all these years. And then I had a zoom with you, didn’t I Chris [Chibnall]? You said ‘Would you do me a great honour being in it’ and I was like ‘wild horses wouldn’t stop me’. It was just amazing. You will find plenty of people on the internet who have not been particularly enamoured of Chris Chibnall and Jodie Whittaker’s time on the show, but already this evening people on social media have also been showing how the last four years has inspired them with their artwork for the finale. The BBC have put together a 35 minute – 35 MINUTES! – video of all the Doctor’s regenerations to date. So if you press play in the next couple of minutes, it should end with Peter Capaldi turning into Jodie Whittaker just in time for the start of tonight’s special. You know what you could be doing while you are waiting for it to start? You could be doing our Doctor Who quiz! Beth Axford has just had her Doctor Who quiz book published, and I worked with her on a Guardian Doctor Who quiz all about the thirteenth Doctor’s time on the show. If you need a recap of the last few years of Doctor Who, the BBC produced this trailer in the last couple of days showcasing key moments from the Whittaker and Chibnall era. Here are some quotes from showrunner Chris Chibnall about what you can expect from tonight’s episode. He told the BBC “You can expect a massive all action thrill ride from start to finish. There will be laughter, there will be huge jeopardy, and there will be tears.” He also said “it’s a regeneration episode, but it’s also a celebratory episode for the BBC centenary and Doctor Who’s place within the BBC. There are lots and lots of easter eggs. Some are visual, some are verbal, some are so deeply buried that only few people will recognise them.” On the decision to bring back Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Ace (Sophie Aldred), who we’ve seen in the trailer and in pre-publicity shots, he said: “Those characters and those actors came to mind as I think they’re representative of certain times in the show’s history and they are both incredibly strong and vibrant characters. There are so many to choose from and in a way you want to do all of them but actually, I had to just pick two! And what both of them said separately was ‘Oh I think, Tegan would get on well with Ace’ and then ‘Oh I think Ace would get on really well with Tegan’.” “This is the day you are erased for ever … bit of a conversation stopper” That is the Master, played by Sacha Dhawan, in the trailer for tonight’s Doctor Who episode, The Power of the Doctor, in which we know that Jodie Whittaker is playing the Doctor for the last time, and is going to regenerate. But how? I’ll be live blogging along with the BBC One transmission of the special which starts at 7.30pm in the UK. I promise not to spoiler anything before it has been seen in the UK, and I’ll be adding some meta-commentary, jokes, pics, reaction and fun as we hurtle towards the end of the Whittaker era. You’ll be able to second-screen it while it is on without me ruining anything, or read it back after the show has finished. And when the episode has finished in the UK, I’ll publish my recap here, and throw open the comments for us all to discuss. I appreciate that it is an international show and not everybody is getting to watch it at the same time, but what can you do? To be clear I’ve been lucky enough to see most of the episode already – up until the very last moments which have been held back from TV reviewers by the BBC – so I don’t know quite how it ends, but I can promise you, without spoilers, that you are in for a ride."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/05/labors-net-zero-authority-wins-backing-after-workers-call-for-help-to-leave-fossil-fuel-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T05:48:02Z","webTitle":"Labor’s net zero authority wins backing after workers call for help to leave fossil fuel industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/05/labors-net-zero-authority-wins-backing-after-workers-call-for-help-to-leave-fossil-fuel-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/05/labors-net-zero-authority-wins-backing-after-workers-call-for-help-to-leave-fossil-fuel-industry","fields":{"bodyText":"Industry groups and unions have welcomed the Albanese government’s creation of a net zero authority aimed at filling the economic hole left by the closure of fossil fuel mines and power stations. The government on Friday confirmed reports that it would set up the authority to promote “the orderly and positive economic transformation” resulting from the shift off carbon polluting industries. Initially, it will set up an agency to start work by 1 July that will advise the government on the final design of a national net zero authority that will be legislated. Speaking from Lake Liddell, near Muswellbrook in the Hunter region of New South Wales, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said: “We want this authority to focus like a laser on any obstacles to job creation and investment. We want it to be a one-stop shop for those thinking of coming to regions like this to create new jobs, to create investment, to create jobs for the future.” Bowen said the new authority would cost $23m in the first year. There will also be $400m from the Powering the Regions Fund to be administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. “Decarbonisation is absolutely essential, but it also takes investment”, he said. The La Trobe Valley in Victoria and the NSW regions of Lithgow and the Hunter Valley – home to coal mines and power stations – are among the areas that have been calling for coordinated help as industries prepare for decarbonisation. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Back in March, the ACTU renewed its call for a national energy transition body to help workers exit the fossil fuel industry, with indications last week the coming federal budget would allocate funds for one. Bowen said he had briefed the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, and other energy ministers. The federal body would complement NSW’s own transition body. Once legislated, the authority would aim to help workers retrain to find new jobs, coordinate programs across government and encourage investment in low-carbon industries to generate new employment. “For years, [Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union] members have been campaigning for a national just transition authority,” the union’s national secretary, Steve Murphy, said. “The move to renewables is happening, but if it’s left up to the private sector, workers will be abandoned, their communities will suffer, and thousands of good jobs will go. “Right across the board, everyone is on the same page now – we all recognise that can’t be allowed to happen.” The Business Council chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said the creation of the authority was “crucial step towards a managed transition that brings communities on this journey”. “Australia’s transition has been held up in part because communities lost confidence in our ability to make this monumental change,” Westacott said. “This is an opportunity for better jobs and better living standards, this agency will do some of the work needed to fix that.” The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors also welcomed the move. “The transition to a low carbon economy is the most significant transformation of our economy since the Industrial Revolution,” said ACSI’s CEO, Louise Davidson, said. “International examples illustrate that a lack of coordination leads to poor outcomes for affected communities, workers and economic activity more broadly.” Bowen did not say who would lead the authority but said it would have “broad representation”. “The cabinet will be considering appointments in coming weeks and we’ll make further announcements after that,” he said, adding that the government planned to legislate the authority “over the course of the next 12 months”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T17:55:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian troops accused of shelling civilians during flood evacuations – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the stories today. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas”. Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv of “blatant lies” at the UN’s top court. One of Russia’s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners Oleg Orlov went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia’s armed forces, his organisation said. A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia’s online information shutdown, the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer reports. The past few days have brought a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive, the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation, the Guardian’s Julian Borger reports. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine’s prosecutor general claimed. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is “actively on the defensive” in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. The investigations team of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu’s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine, the Guardian’s Shaun Walker reported. Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the “unfolding tragedy” in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a “terrorist plot” in a statement. Britain announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross, who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Thank you for following along. Read more of our live coverage on the blog tomorrow. Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv instead of “blatant lies” at the UN’s top court. Ukraine has asked The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Russia to halt alleged discrimination against the Tatar ethnic group in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula occupied by Russia since 2014. At the second day of hearings at the ICJ, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, Alexander Shulgin, said: Ukraine is constantly turning to blatant lies and false accusations leveled against the Russian federation. In the same case, Kyiv also says that Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in 2014. On the first day of the hearing, Ukraine accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea. Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. The court adjourned on Thursday but will hold two more days of hearings next week where Ukraine and Russia can react to each other’s submissions. The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year. Here is a round-up of images from the wires of Ukrainian’s recusing animals from flooding in the Kherson region after the Nova Kakhovka dam was breached. One of Russia’s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia’s armed forces, his organisation said. Oleg Orlov has since 1999 been one of the leaders of Memorial, which won a share of the Nobel Peace prize in 2022 a year after being banned and dissolved in Russia. Since sending its tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has intensified a long-running clampdown on all forms of political dissent and made it an offence to discredit the armed forces or deviate from government accounts of what it calls a “special military operation”, Reuters reports. Orlov, who came to prominence by opposing Soviet totalitarianism, told the independent Moscow Times last month that campaigners like him were to some extent following the path of anti-communist dissidents of the cold war era. The charges are based on an article he wrote denouncing Russia for waging the conflict. He told the court, according to a Memorial post on Telegram: In my article I spoke about the terrible role that war plays for the development of the political regime in our country. “This is an opinion, reasoning, an evaluation,” he said, adding that he could not understand how he could be punished for expressing an opinion. Orlov’s defence team included Dmitry Muratov, editor of the now-banned independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and also a winner of the Nobel Peace prize, for his decades of work to defend freedom of speech in Russia. Outside the court, Muratov told reporters: Article 29 of the constitution directly says that censorship is prohibited, everyone has the right to disseminate information, and no one has the right to force anyone to give up their beliefs. Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Russia director, said the state could not tolerate Orlov’s “need to defend the truth and his refusal to remain silent”. “The price he and others pay for exercising their right to freedom of expression in today’s Russia is very high indeed,” she said. A senior Russian commander briefed President Vladimir Putin today on how his forces had repelled a large-scale Ukrainian attack in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the Tass news agency reported. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier on Thursday that Russian forces had withstood fierce overnight attempts by Ukrainian troops to break through the frontline in Zaporizhzhia and had inflicted heavy losses on them, according to Reuters. The Russian defence ministry on Thursday evening released a video clip of an interview in which a commander called Col Gen Alexander Romanchuk was seen explaining how Russian forces had held off the Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia. A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia’s online information shutdown. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has blocked or closed down nearly all independent media outlets. The Kremlin has also blocked major western social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. In part, the letter said: The Russian authorities are preparing for Vladimir Putin’s re-election in 2024. No other discourse than official propaganda will be tolerated. We have strong suspicions that YouTube and Telegram could be totally blocked in Russia no later than this autumn. After that, more than 140 million people would be hostages of the state propaganda narrative. Only two major platforms have partially survived this purge for now. Telegram and YouTube are the only spaces left for Russian journalists to try to inform their fellow citizens about the reality of the war waged in their name by Vladimir Putin. The joint statement continued “We do not want to live in a new cold war era. There is an urgent need to reconnect Russian citizens with pluralistic information, and with the rest of the world.” “It is the essence of the internet to provide this function,” continues the statement addressed to the heads of global tech giants including the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, the Twitter CEO, Elon Musk, and the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, saying: “What we need now is to establish a communication channel between representatives of the platforms and us, to build together solutions to reconnect Russian citizens with their independent press in exile.” It added: “Russian citizens will find themselves locked in the dark alone with their president” if free information on the internet is not supported. The past few days have seen a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive. Nasa’s satellite monitoring of fires in that area of the frontline confirms what Russian bloggers have been saying: that the area around Tokmak and Orihiv first under very heavy preparatory shelling followed by a Ukrainian attempt to break through Russian defences towards Tokmak. This area of the front has long been seen as a likely axis for a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol, not least because Tokmak itself is a major railway junction and Russian logistical hub that has key lines of communication with both Mauripol and Berdiansk. Russia has long feared a Ukrainian advance here building multi-layered defences including zigzag trenches, dragon’s teeth, minefields and other obstacles also reinforcing the area with both troops and medical personnel. On Telegram, the Russian military blogger channel War Gonzo said it remained “too early to say” that the Ukrainian offensive had become bogged down, describing a “hard night” for Russian forces around Orihiv. It added: It is reported from the scene that in the direction of Orehiv-Tokmak the enemy infantry continues to approach and try to gain a foothold. Enemy artillery and tanks are still intensively working on our positions. Our troops hold the line and do not allow a breakthrough of the front, destroying enemy manpower and equipment. According to information from the field, our fighters managed to knock out a tank similar to the Leopard, but it is still impossible to identify the destroyed equipment for certain. Other Russian online sources spoke of an assault with armour and infantry with the village of Robotyne being a focus of Ukrainian assaults in the past 24 hours with both Ukrainian and Russian aviation active in the sector. On Thursday there were also reports that the Russian occupation administration had ordered evacuations from settlements around Tokmak. It remains unclear, however, whether the fighting in the Tokmak area represents Ukraine’s main effort. While it appears to be more substantial than a reconnaissance in force, it is possible that the push in recent days could be a so called “demonstration” designed to persuade Moscow that the main advance will be in the direction of Melitopol. Ukraine’s general staff will also be using the current assault to gather active intelligence on the quality of Russia’s defensive positions as it moves forward. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dike around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse in the dike around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst case scenario and there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns over the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro river and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds used to cool the reactor cores. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said: It is vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou told the Guardian. The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said today that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough “to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation” but he warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined - both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. “We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant’s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.” The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh has tweeted from the village of Bilozerka, west of Kherson, where two dozen houses were underwater. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the bursting of the Soviet-era Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which sent waters cascading across the war zone of southern Ukraine in the early hours of Tuesday, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. Reuters reports: “The impact of the region’s water supply sanitation systems and public health services cannot be underestimated,” the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press briefing. “The WHO has rushed in to support the authorities and health care workers in preventive measures against waterborne diseases and to improve disease surveillance.” Asked specifically about cholera, WHO technical officer Teresa Zakaria said that the risk of an outbreak was present since the pathogen exists in the environment. She said that the WHO was working with Ukraine’s health ministry to put mechanisms in place to ensure that vaccines can be imported if needed. “We are trying to address quite a wide range of health risks actually associated with the floods, starting from trauma to drowning, to waterborne diseases but also all the way to the potential implications of disruption to chronic treatment,” she added. The huge Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River separates Russian and Ukrainian forces and people have been affected on both sides of its banks. WHO’s emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said the WHO has offered assistance to Russian-controlled areas but that its operational presence was “primarily” on the Ukrainian side. He said Russian authorities had given them assurances that people living in areas it occupies were being “well monitored, well cared for, well fed [and] well supported”. “We will be delighted to be able to access those areas and be able to monitor health as we would in most situations wish to do,” he said, adding it would be for the Ukrainian and Russian authorities to agree how that could be achieved. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. “Without a source of water supply, it is impossible to grow vegetables. Grain and oilseeds will be grown using an extensive model with low yields,” the ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports. The ministry said the dam’s destruction would flood tens of thousands of hectares of agricultural land in southern Ukraine and could turn at least 500,000 hectares of land left without irrigation into “deserts”. The ministry said the flooded land would require a full agro-ecological assessment of the soil condition and in most cases special soil restoration methods would need to be applied. It said vegetables, melons, grains and oilseeds were the main products which were grown on the affected land. Ukraine is a major global grain and oilseeds grower and exporter. The destruction of the dam on Tuesday, which Ukraine and Russia blame on each other, has also made it impossible to navigate parts of the Dnipro River and deprived Kyiv of an important agricultural export route, shipping authorities said. The agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, also said the farm sector’s losses could be much higher than previously expected because the disaster inflicted “years” of damage on irrigation. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine‘s prosecutor general claimed. The prosecutor general’s office said two other people were wounded in the incident and that four were hurt in a separate location, and that a war crimes investigation had been opened. “Due to targeted strikes by the occupiers during evacuation measures in the city, a civilian died,” it said in a statement, Reuters reports. The interior ministry said eight people had been wounded during Russian strikes on Kherson but mentioned no deaths. The ministry said the Russian shelling had begun “precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded”. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is “actively on the defensive” in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. In an update on Telegram she said: In the east, our troops are active in the Bakhmut direction. Fighting continues. In some places, the enemy tries to go on the offensive, but without success … in the Zaporizhzhia direction in the Orikhiv area, the enemy is actively on the defensive. Russian military bloggers on Telegram today have been posting about activity in the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu is quoted by Tass as saying an attack has been repulsed. [See 13.59 BST] Tass quotes him saying: Today at 1.30am in the Zaporizhzhia direction, the enemy attempted to break through our defences with the forces of the 47th mechanised brigade, numbering up to 1,500 people and 150 armoured vehicles. The Tass report goes on to say that Shoigu claimed “as a result of a two-hour battle, the armed forces of Ukraine lost 30 tanks, 11 infantry fighting vehicles, and up to 350 personnel. Thus, the enemy’s specially trained reserve forces for the implementation of this breakthrough did not fulfil their task.” Speaking of the Russian defence minister, our central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker has this report: The investigations team of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu’s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine. Previously, Shoigu was known to have two daughters, but Navalny’s team say the defence minister had a secret second family in the early 2000s, and obtained documents it claimed showed his mistress had received a vast, lavish property despite a modest official salary. Navalny’s team claimed 22-year-old Danila Shebunov was one of three children from Shoigu’s second, secret, relationship, and said he also owned prime real estate in central Moscow. These properties allegedly bring Shebunov a sizeable income from rent, and were allegedly obtained thanks to his father’s connections. Shebunov, who goes by the name Sheba Singer, has a rich social media presence, although few followers, and recently has produced a steady output of pop songs and lifestyle videos, usually in English and often involving him undressing. Maria Pevchikh of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, who presented the video investigation, asked ironically why it was that Shebunov was producing this kind of output rather than suffering in a trench in Ukraine along with thousands of Russian soldiers his age. For years, Navalny’s team has made videos it says expose corruption and hypocrisy in Putin’s elite. The latest video, 19 minutes long, had clocked up more than 100,000 views on YouTube within an hour of being posted. Neither Shoigu nor Shebunov have yet commented on the video. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. Shoigu was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that four separate Ukrainian attacks along the front had been halted and that Kyiv’s forces had been forced to retreat “with heavy losses”. These claims have not been independently verified. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. Ukraine’s interior ministry said in a statement: The shelling began precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded. It reiterated accusations that Russia had abandoned people in territory it occupied in the Kherson region, adding: And it continues to prevent Ukraine from saving the most valuable – human lives. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the “unfolding tragedy” in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a “terrorist plot”. In a statement, permanent representative Vassily Nebenzia at the UN security council (UNSC) briefing on the situation around the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant said: On the night of 5 June to 6 [June], the Kyiv regime committed an unthinkable crime. They blasted the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which resulted in an uncontrolled release of water downstream of the Dnipro River. Feeling its total impunity and being encouraged by western sponsors, the Kyiv regime decided to fulfil this terrorist plot this time. The responsibility for this unfolding tragedy fully rests with the Kyiv regime and its western masters who pump up Ukraine with weapons. The water level at a reservoir in southern Ukraine is approaching a dangerous low after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the state company overseeing the facility said on Thursday, which could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow and Kyiv blamed one another for the collapse of the dam on Tuesday, which unleashed water from the Dnipro River into a wide area of the Kherson region, Reuters reports. Ihor Syrota, general director of the energy company Ukrhydroenergo, told Ukrainian television that a drop below the current water level at the Kakhovka reservoir could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and water supply to other regions. He said: We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 (meters), after which there will be not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station … or. … for all regions.” Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said on Thursday the situation was “stable and under control” at the Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday morning. Syrota added that Ukrhydroenergo was ready to work on an overlay across the damaged hydroelectric station and dam as soon as Russian forces left the eastern side of the Dnipro, and that it would take about two months to complete. Britain has announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. Belarus, led by president Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, is Russia’s staunchest ally among ex-Soviet states and allowed its territory to be used to launch the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Last month Russia moved ahead with a decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement: This new package ratchets up the economic pressure on Lukashenko and his regime which actively facilitates the Russian war effort and ignores Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The new package includes banning the import of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus from Britain of banknotes and machinery, as well as goods, technologies and materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Britain said it would also be able to prevent designated Belarusian media companies from “spreading propaganda in the UK” with social media companies and internet service providers restricting access to the websites of sanctioned Belarusian media organisations. Flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine has forced Russian troops to retreat by distances of five to 15km (three to nine miles) in the Kherson region, a military spokesperson said. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, told Ukrainian television the redeployment had “practically halved” Russian shelling in the region, Reuters reports. Russia has not yet commented. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region said in a statement posted on Telegram that two settlements in the region had been attacked by drones. Belgorod, which borders Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, has come under repeated attack from Kyiv’s forces in recent weeks. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come … The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the staff at one of Kherson’s hospitals for their work in helping people affected by the explosion at the Nova Kakhovka dam during a visit. In a tweet, he described medics as “heroic people” and wished patients good health. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, did not currently have any plans to visit the disaster area. Here are some more images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visiting people at a hospital that is being used as one of Kherson’s evacuation points. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were “the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas”. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there was a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital, saying that the city’s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. The US president, Joe Biden, is to welcome the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “top of mind”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mabel Banfield-Nwachi will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian Industry and Trade minister Denis Manturov said on Thursday that Moscow has no access to the damaged part of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, and does not expect to be granted it, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia has made the restart of the pipeline, which before the war carried ammonia from Russia to Ukraine for export, central to future renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to export its grain safely from its Black Sea ports. Reuters reports that both Russia and Ukraine this week claimed there was damage to a section of the pipeline that runs through the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The two sides have blamed each other. The water level in the North Crimean Canal, which carries water from the Kakhovka reservoir behind the breached Kakhovka dam to the Crimean peninsula, remains stable, Reuters reports the Russian-imposed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Thursday. Crimea relies heavily on water transported by the canal. After Moscow seized the peninsula in 2014, claiming to have annexed it, Kyiv blocked the canal. Mines uprooted and dispersed by flood waters surging downstream from the breached Kakhovka dam across swathes of southern Ukraine could pose a grave danger to civilians for decades to come, the Red Cross said. “In the past we knew where the hazards were. Now we don’t know. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,” said Erik Tollefsen, head of the Weapon Contamination Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross. “It is with a certain horror that we look at the news coming out,” Reuters reports Tollefsen said in an audio clip, adding that the second world war mines found underwater in Denmark in 2015 were still active. Besides anti-personnel mines, both sides have used vast amounts of artillery shells and anti-tank mines. The exact number of mines in Ukraine is unclear, said Tollefsen. “We just know the numbers are massive,” said Tollefsen. Tollefsen said the issue with mines was not necessarily the nominal number of mines but where they were laid – especially in a heavily agricultural country such as Ukraine. Here are some of the first images to be released of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kherson. They show Ukraine’s president touring the flooded area and speaking to Ihor Klymenko, the head of the national police. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reports that there is a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River. He has posted to Telegram: In connection with the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam, there was an uncontrolled flow of water from the Dnipro River downstream. There is a rise in the water level in the Inhulets River, which flows into the Dnipro. Listing several villages near Kalynivske, which is about 22 miles (35km) from the Dnipro, Litvinov warned: “Due to the flooding of the bridge, it is not possible to travel to the village of Zapovit. The water is getting close to the homes of residents.” Here are some images that have been sent to us over the news wires from occupied Ukraine, showing the impact of flooding in Nova Kakhovka, where the local Russian-imposed official has said five people have died. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has posted to Twitter video footage released by Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office of his meeting in Kherson. If you wanted something to listen to, today our Today in Focus podcast features my colleague Dan Sabbagh on the ground in Kherson talking about the aftermath of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. You can listen to it here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Three people are known to have died on the Ukraine-controlled bank of the Dnipro River, while occupying authorities on the left-bank have said at least five people were killed. Ukraine’s regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, has said about 230 sq miles (600 sq km) of the region is under water, and that Ukraine has so far evacuated almost 2,000 people. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine’s president wrote: Working trip to Kherson region. A coordination meeting on the liquidation of consequences of the Kakhovka HPP dam explosion. Many important issues were discussed. The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organization of life support for the flooded areas. Also, the prospects for restoring the region’s ecosystem and the operational military situation in the man-made disaster area. It is important to calculate the damage and allocate funds to compensate residents affected by the disaster and develop a programme to compensate for losses or relocate businesses within the Kherson region. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, Tass reports, citing the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine’s capital. He has been under pressure after people were killed when they were unable to get into a shelter. On Telegram, Klitschko wrote: Today, the Kyiv city council has to adopt a comprehensive draft decision concerning shelters. In particular, to warn the owners of private premises that if they are not properly maintained or people are not admitted during the air raid, these premises may be seized from them. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was under water on Thursday after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. “We’re already working. We will help everyone that has ended up in trouble,” Reuters reports he said in a video statement of the flooding, caused by the collapse of the dam. “Despite the immense danger and constant Russian shelling, evacuation from zones of flooding is continuing,” Prokudin said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Russian media reports that almost 4,300 people have been evacuated in the occupied area of Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, citing the regional authority head of Kherson, reports that as of this morning “almost 2,000 people have been evacuated from the flooded zone” in the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro River. The left bank of the Dnipro and southern portion of Kherson is occupied by Russia. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that “missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city”. The occupied city is the largest in the Luhansk region, one of four Ukrainian regions the Russian Federation claimed to have annexed in late 2022. More details soon … South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders’ peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said on Thursday. Putin expressed his desire to receive the peace mission, Reuters reports the presidency statement said. Maxar has supplied these satellite images of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The first was taken on 5 June. The second shows the condition of the dam yesterday, on 7 June. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass, citing emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Ukraine’s Kherson region, has said up to 14,000 homes have been flooded and nearly 4,300 people evacuated. In a status update on Telegram, Tass reported: Over 14,000 houses were flooded after the breakthrough of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated, emergency services report. Twenty-three people were seen by doctors of which 21 were hospitalised, medical services reported. Our First Edition morning newsletter today features my colleague Esther Addley talking to our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh, who is in Kherson. Here is an extract: “This is a huge crisis,” said Dan Sabbagh, adding that there is “something elemental” about the scale of the flooding. “It’s just a massive river. We don’t know where the river boundary will end up. We don’t know what the new landscape will look like.” The water was still rising, though more slowly than before, when Dan spoke to me yesterday from central Kherson. He was standing at a crossroads that ordinarily would be hundreds of metres from the riverbank; instead, he said, the kerb had become “quite a busy little port” as rescue boats came and went. For eight months last year, Kherson was occupied by Russian forces; parts of it have been heavily damaged by shelling and many people had already left the city by the time the floods hit. “Younger people tend to get out as fast as they can,” said Dan. “The residents who have stayed on are mostly older, and have point blank refused to go.” For many of those who remained, though, the flooding has forced them out of the homes they resolutely refused to quit. As we spoke, Dan described an inflatable dinghy arriving, carrying a woman in her 70s and an older man who was unable to walk, who had been rescued along with “the obligatory dog”. A basket of five brown cats had been brought in a little earlier; in the background a dog was barking. “There are a lot of abandoned pets – you see them everywhere. It’s just a feature of a war zone.” Read more here: Thursday briefing – The Kherson dam disaster has left thousands of Ukrainians adrift, and that’s just the start You can sign up for our free daily newsletter First Edition. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has this morning insisted that, in the wake of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the war is not regarded as a conflict between neighbours. She tweeted: There is no equivalence in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It’s not a “conflict” between neighbours. It is an illegal invasion by Russia. Whose efforts have gone beyond stealing Ukrainian land to destroying it and the Ukrainian people who live peacefully on it. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The Associated Press reports that Sunak is also looking to make the case to Biden for UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace to succeed outgoing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to end his term leading the 31-member alliance in September. Stoltenberg is slated to meet with Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are set to gather in Lithuania on 11-12 July for their annual summit. President Joe Biden is welcoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind”, the Associated Press reports. The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. “The two leaders will review a range of global issues including our economic partnership or shared support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s war of aggression, as well as further action to accelerate the clean energy transition,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president and the prime minister will also discuss the joint US-UK leadership on critical emerging technologies as well as our work to strengthen our economic security.” In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,” he said. “We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. That update from the International Atomic Energy explains that while all six of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plan’t reactors are “in shutdown mode” cooling water is still needed “to prevent fuel melt and a possible release of radioactive material”. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. “In view of the IAEA’s intensifying activities under the newly established principles, he will also strengthen the IAEA’s presence at the site, replacing the current team with a larger group travelling with him across the frontline,” the IAEA announced in an update on Wednesday. It quoted Director General Grossi as saying, “The possible loss of the plant’s main source of cooling water further complicates an already extremely difficult and challenging nuclear safety and security situation”. The update outlines threats to the water supply for ponds that feed cool the plant’s nuclear reactors. The agency said that it was working to ensure that there was as much cooling water in reserve as possible in the event that it could no longer access the Kakhovka reservoir. The reservoir’s water levels were continuing to drop, the agency said. It explained that the reservoir’s water levels had already fallen by 2.8 metres since Tuesday, but that the hourly rate of loss had slowed to “ between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour from a peak of around 11 cm/hour yesterday”. “If the level falls below 12.7 metres, the ZNPP will no longer be able to pump water from the reservoir to the site.” it said, adding that this level could be reached in two days. “Preparing for such a possibility, the ZNPP is continuously replenishing its water reserves – including the large cooling pond next to the plant as well as its smaller sprinkler cooling ponds and the adjacent channels – by fully utilising the water of the Kakhovka reservoir while this still remains possible.” Three people have died as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, local media have reported, in what would be the first confirmed deaths, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced fears for the lives of Ukrainians in Russian-held areas hit by the disaster. Citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky, Yevhen Ryshchuk, the Kyiv Independent reported that “three people drowned” in the Kherson region. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. At least three people have been confirmed dead as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday, citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky in Kherson region. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant’s reactors. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address that it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied areas due to the flooding, urging a “clear and rapid reaction from the world” to support victims. “The situation in occupied parts of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers are simply abandoning people in frightful conditions. No help, without water, left on the roofs of houses in submerged communities,” he said. “If an international organisation is not present in the disaster zone, it means it does not exist at all or is incapable.” Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have been left “without normal access to drinking water” after the destruction, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned. The Ukrainian leader said the evacuation of people and the urgent provision of drinking water were top priorities. The World Bank will support Ukraine by conducting a rapid assessment of damages and needs, a top bank official said on Wednesday. Anna Bjerde, the World Bank’s managing director for operations, said the destruction of the Novo Kakhovka dam had “many very serious consequences for essential service delivery and the broader environment.” Drone footage showed roads and buildings in Kherson completely submerged by flood water. The critical dam, which lies along the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s Kherson region – now held by Russia – collapsed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told Putin in a phone call on Wednesday that a comprehensive investigation was needed into the destruction of the dam. Erdoğan told Putin that an international commission that includes the UN and Turkey could be formed to look into the issue, a statement from the Turkish president’s office said. Britain cannot yet say Russia is responsible for the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, prime minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday. Asked during a visit to the US whether Russia was responsible, Sunak said: “I can’t say that definitively yet” but that “if true it will represent a new low. It’s an appalling act of barbarism on Russia’s part.” The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible for the destruction of the dam, national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, he told reporters at the White House, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. France will send aid to Ukraine “to meet immediate needs” after the destruction of the dam, President Emmanuel Macron has said. Macron said he expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the aftermath of what he described as an “atrocious act which is endangering populations”. A top Moscow-backed official in a part of Ukraine controlled by Russia has said that the collapse of the dam has handed the Russian military a tactical advantage. Vladimir Saldo said he believed Kyiv was to blame for the disaster but that the dam’s destruction and resulting flood waters would make it easier for Russia to defend against any Ukrainian counter-offensive in the area. Relief workers on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the river have reported having to work under fire. The UN’s humanitarian aid agency warned the disaster “will likely get worse in the coming hours”, with access to drinking water and health risks associated with contaminated water among the most pressing concerns. Ukraine has not yet launched a planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia, a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, dismissed statements by Russian officials who have said the counteroffensive has already begun, adding that its start will be obvious to everyone when it happens. Russia’s defence ministry has said “Ukrainian saboteurs” had blown up a section of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline on Monday, which carries fertiliser from Russia to Ukraine in Kharkiv region. There was no immediate comment on the allegations from Ukraine. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/china-aukus-submarines-deal-embarks-path-error-danger","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T09:34:08Z","webTitle":"China says Aukus submarines deal embarks on ‘path of error and danger’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/china-aukus-submarines-deal-embarks-path-error-danger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/china-aukus-submarines-deal-embarks-path-error-danger","fields":{"bodyText":"China has accused the US, UK and Australia of embarking on a “path of error and danger” in response to the Aukus partners’ announcement of a deal on nuclear-powered submarines. “The latest joint statement from the US, UK and Australia demonstrates that the three countries, for the sake of their own geopolitical interests, completely disregard the concerns of the international communities and are walking further and further down the path of error and danger,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a regular press briefing on Tuesday. The multibillion-dollar deal, announced during a meeting of Aukus leaders in San Diego on Monday, will provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines in an effort to counter the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific. The spokesperson’s comments came after the Chinese mission to the UN tweeted a statement accusing the three countries of fuelling an arms race. It said the deal was a “textbook case of double standard”. The US president, Joe Biden, rejected the accusation, saying the submarines would be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. Penny Wong, Australia’s foreign minister, said the Chinese criticism was “not grounded in fact”. Biden said he expected to speak with Xi Jinping – who recently secured a third term as China’s president – soon but declined to elaborate. On Tuesday Wang said China did not want to “communicate for the sake of communicating” but that “the US side should come forward sincerely, with practical actions to promote China-US relations”. Relations between China and the US are at their lowest in decades. Various channels of communication, including military dialogues, have been paused since Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August, angering China. In February the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that floated into US airspace. China said it was a meteorological monitoring device that had blown off course, but the US rejected that claim and cancelled a long-awaited trip by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, to Beijing. The US and its allies are increasingly worried about the prospect of China launching a conflict with Taiwan, which would be catastrophic for the self-governing island’s 23 million people and would spill over into the rest of the region. Observers are watching closely for signs that China’s military is preparing for such an attack. On Monday Xi closed China’s annual parliamentary session with a speech in which he promised to build China’s armed forces into a “great wall of steel”. On Tuesday, Taiwan’s foreign ministry said it “welcomes the continued advancement of the Aukus partnership”, noting that Taiwan is “at the forefront of the fight against authoritarian expansion”. Biden has promised to respond militarily if China invades Taiwan, but of the allies Australia would be the first to feel the impact of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, said the Aukus deal, which is forecast to cost $268bn (£220bn) to $368bn, was the “biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in all of its history”.

Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17 and 18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. “Heating season”, the period when the central heating is on, will come later and end earlier, said Vitrenko. The target depends on Ukraine’s international allies giving it the necessary funds to import 4bn cubic metres-worth of gas, as well as no wildcards playing out – such as Russia destroying gas infrastructure or further decreasing its gas supplies to Europe. “Without the [western] financial support we will lack gas and it will mean we’ll have really high risks for the power system [going] down,” Vitrenko said. He described how Naftogaz backed up some of Ukraine’s power companies with gas in March when coal supplies were halted by the war. “[Otherwise] there would have been no electricity,” he said. “[Without the gas imports], there will be blackouts in big parts of Ukraine,” Vitrenko said. “In terms of heating, if we don’t have this 2bn cbm of gas, then it will mean some of the households will not get enough heating … so it will be really too cold.” Ukraine produces about 60% of the gas it needs domestically and imports the rest from its European Union neighbours at market prices. The country stopped buying gas from Russia directly in 2014, though it still consumes much of the same Russian gas that comes via pipelines through Ukraine from EU suppliers. This roundabout system was devised to stop Russia from using gas as a tool to influence Ukraine. Gas contracts between Russia and Ukraine were a longstanding source of grand corruption, with Ukrainian politicians and oligarchs allowing Russia to hold sway in the country’s internal affairs in exchange for cheap gas. Ukraine needs about $10bn to import gas. Vitrenko said he thought its allies understood the need but he could not be confident Ukraine would get the funds because “it’s very difficult to be confident during a war”. The current calculus could change, however, if, for instance, Russia targets any of Ukraine’s critical gas infrastructure, power plants or gas production facilities. About 50% of Ukraine’s gas fields are in the Kharkiv region, four miles from the frontlines. If it or Ukraine’s storage facilities were to be damaged, Ukraine would need to import more gas. Another much talked-about risk is if Russia decides to further decrease gas supplies to the EU, making the cost of gas even more expensive. Russia cut supplies to the EU earlier this year, dramatically raising gas and electricity prices in some countries, including the UK. “The world is experiencing the first truly global energy crisis in history,” Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, wrote last month. “The situation is especially perilous in Europe, which is at the epicentre of the energy market turmoil.” Ukraine’s state gas company defaulted on creditors in July, saying the war had left many of its customers unable to pay their bills. Normally, said Vitrenko, Ukraine’s state gas company would buy gas from the EU and sell it on for a profit. But given soaring prices and the endemic unemployment caused by the war, Ukraine will need to subsidise energy prices this year. Russia has targeted critical energy infrastructure since February, including oil refineries and power stations. In the event that it targets gas infrastructure or gas production facilities, Ukraine is preparing emergency kits that could service up to 200,000 people, including mobile boilers, mobile heating units and diesel power generators. “If a big city like Kyiv or Kharkiv [is cut off], of course, [the kits] won’t be enough, but in some small towns these emergency kits will make a difference,” Vitrenko said. “It all depends on the scale of the damage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/20/xis-authority-dented-by-sudden-covid-u-turn-but-iron-grip-on-power-is-undimmed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T01:42:14Z","webTitle":"Xi’s authority dented by sudden Covid U-turn, but grip on power is as strong as ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/xis-authority-dented-by-sudden-covid-u-turn-but-iron-grip-on-power-is-undimmed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/20/xis-authority-dented-by-sudden-covid-u-turn-but-iron-grip-on-power-is-undimmed","fields":{"bodyText":"Just a few months ago, the thought of questioning the strength of Xi Jinping’s leadership was inconceivable. He had just secured his third term, conducted a brutal purge of factional rivals and ensured he and his beliefs were inextricably and existentially tied with the Chinese Communist party. The zero-Covid policy – despite some societal grumblings – had been enshrined as the best and only way out of the pandemic. But zero Covid was already growing unpopular in China in the latter half of 2022. It was playing havoc with people’s lives with increasing lockdowns and quarantines, and a string of tragedies had been linked to the policy’s enforcement. Then in early December, after protests in major Chinese cities and rising cases of Omicron, the government suddenly ended the policy. Travel restrictions, quarantines, mandatory tests and other restrictions were drastically scaled back or dropped altogether. The move appeared to supercharge the outbreak. Cities have reported infection rates of up to 90%. There are external estimates of more than half a million dead, economic figures have failed to meet already low expectations, and people are warily heading off to lunar new year gatherings amid warnings to stay away from elderly relatives. Xi and his government are now facing criticism that they failed to prepare and are not being honest about the fallout. Critics also say the authorities have struggled to justify the decision to end the policy so suddenly. “Certainly the prestige and therefore the authority of Xi Jinping has been dented,” says Dr Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation. After consolidating more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, analysts say Xi’s leadership is unlikely to be affected by any dissatisfaction with him. However, his absolute hold on power raises concerns about where his whims might take China. Prof Carl Minzner, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the results of the dramatic policy change are a worrying sign of the dynamic created when Chinese policies are implemented – or changed – on the “whim of a single leader”, likening it to Mao leading China into famine, or the Cultural Revolution. Local authorities were largely responsible for the confusing and inconsistent measures, but they – almost competitively – were aiming to meet the broad and ambitious objectives of Xi’s national policy. That policy was considered unimpeachable and if things went wrong the local officials were blamed for poor implementation. But they can’t be blamed for its reversal. “The policies were so tied to Xi that reasoned discussion on the merits of the policy were nearly impossible from 2020 to 2022,” says Minzner, who also wrote End of an Era: How China’s Authoritarian Revival is Undermining Its Rise. “It also meant careful preparation for what might follow after zero Covid was also impossible – it would have required low-level officials to acknowledge that zero Covid might end.” Xi and his officials are aware that things went wrong. In public statements they have talked of the challenges of this new era, of the need for local authorities to ensure supplies and improve hospital capacity. But the statements carry no apology or accountability, and Xi maintains that the path taken was still the right one. There’s some truth in the argument – zero Covid protected China through the worst of the variants and, as far as it is possible to tell, the death toll appears to remain far below many other nations. But the result of lifting it so suddenly has drawn accusations that the hardships of the preceding three years were for nothing. ‘This is a mess’ Publicly, China’s government maintains the Covid policy “adjustments” were planned, well-prepared, and based on science. But there are signs the reversal was ill-prepared at best, or a reckless kneejerk reaction at worst. Restrictions were lifted in winter, just before the year’s biggest holiday. Many hospitals were under-resourced and quickly overwhelmed, with governments advertising for new staff well after the wave had started. Medication production couldn’t keep up with demand, prompting Chinese diaspora communities to send it from abroad. Vaccination rates were still dangerously low among older groups, while for others it had been a long time since their last shot. Some residents rushed over the border to get the foreign-made mRNA vaccines that Xi refused to approve. Data collection quickly fell over – last week the government updated its official death toll from a few dozen since December to more than 50,000, but it still fell far short of international estimates. “I think what everyone thinks: this is a mess by the government,” a 33-year-old marketing executive in Shenzhen tells the Guardian. “What was the point of the last year? We were all vaccinated but nothing was open, so what was the strategy?” Lam says the major protests in November marked a turning point. China has hundreds, maybe thousands of small protests a year, but they are usually by people from what Lam termed “disadvantaged sectors”. “But this time you could see … people of all sectors, all classes, including famous professors, parents of medium-ranked cadres if not senior cadres, people from across the political and economic spectrum have been hurt. Both before and after the policy reversal.” Dissatisfaction among Chinese people is almost impossible to quantify, but there is a noticeable increase in complaints and questioning on social media, often using codes or tricks of language, and conspiracy theories are spreading that speculate – without evidence – about nefarious government plots behind the reopening. “However the propaganda machinery spins it, most saw what they saw and could not have failed to see how Xi messed it up,” says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the Soas Institute. “But will it significantly undermine his hold to power? Not at all, at least in the short term. Xi’s hold to power is based more on fear and passive acceptance than love and admiration.” Inside China’s political elite, there has been concern with Xi’s direction since at least 2018, when Xi abolished term limits, says Jeff Wasserstrom, a China expert and UC Irvine history professor. “There are more and more reasons for people to be discontented with what Xi Jinping has been doing … It’s a small segment of population but it’s an influential one.” But, Wasserstrom notes, it’s also a segment Xi has long targeted. Those most likely to be unhappy with his direction were likely among those ousted at the Party Congress, or in previous purges. Minzner says the ease with which Xi reversed such a significant policy seemingly overnight “does make you worry about choices he can make elsewhere”. An obvious fear is for Xi’s plans to annex Taiwan – seen as unlikely for now – but Minzner says there are other issues too. Several analysts the Guardian spoke to described a catch-22 in Xi’s leadership, but one he ultimately benefits from. He has consolidated power so successfully that he essentially is the party. It means that he owns its mistakes as well as its successes, but having effectively destroyed the prospects of any opposition, it’s of little consequence. There may be dissatisfaction with Xi, but not among anyone powerful enough to do something about it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T16:30:46Z","webTitle":"‘Unproven’ small nuclear reactors would raise Australia’s energy costs and delay renewable uptake, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/05/unproven-small-nuclear-reactors-would-raise-energy-costs-and-delay-renewable-uptake-report-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The next generation of small nuclear reactors being advocated by the Coalition would raise electricity prices, slow the uptake of renewables and introduce new risks from nuclear waste, according to a report from the Australian Conservation Foundation. But the report from the conservation group has found only two small modular reactors (SMRs) are known to be operating around the world, in Russia and China, and both have seen large cost blowouts. Promoters of nuclear energy, the report claims, were pinning their hopes on technology that was “uncertain and unproven”. “The good news about the renewed nuclear discussion is that it highlights that business as usual with fossil fuels is not an option,” the report found. “The bad news is the very real risk of delay, distraction and a failure to advance a just energy transition”. Last week during question time, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, mocked the Coalition for supporting nuclear and asked which MP would be willing to have a reactor in their electorate. Nuclear energy has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s, but some Coalition senators are pushing for those restrictions to be lifted. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has tasked the shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, to review the status of nuclear energy. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the report Dave Sweeney, ACF’s Nuclear Free campaigner, wrote SMRs would push up electricity costs and introduce unnecessary challenges in managing nuclear waste. “In short, Australia’s energy future is renewable, not radioactive,” he wrote. According to the report, Russia’s floating nuclear plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, has two small SMR units on board. Construction costs had ballooned sixfold. Work started in 2012 on a demonstration plant in China with two gas-cooled reactors that was completed nine years later, costing $8.8bn. “The global SMR reality simply does not come close to matching the Australian SMR rhetoric,” the report says. Three further SMR plants were under construction in Argentina, China and Russia but had been plagued by cost rises and delays, the report said. In June, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested future deployment of SMRs could increase the amount of nuclear waste by factors of two to 30, depending on the design. In a report last year for the Minerals Council of Australia, the nuclear energy analyst and advocate Ben Heard argued there was a lack of standardised work on the true cost of SMRs. But he said SMRs would hold a “substantial place in a lowest-cost decarbonised economy” and if they were available in Australia they would “widen the road to that decarbonised future”. Heard argued SMRs could operate for more than 40 years delivering zero-carbon electricity. He wrote: “Deploying nuclear power technologies requires a national uplift in competencies and capabilities that a country retains from that point forward. “That journey might be accelerated, particularly for a nation with established capacity like Australia, but it cannot be rushed.” In June the International Energy Agency said SMRs were not yet commercially viable, but “lower cost, smaller size and reduced project risks” could improve social acceptance. There was increased support and interest in Canada, France, UK and the US for the technology, the report said, adding: “But the successful long-term deployment of SMRs hinges on strong support from policymakers starting now, not just to mobilise investment but also to streamline and harmonise regulatory frameworks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/07/nuclear-apocalypse-was-postponed-in-1968-now-its-back-on-the-agenda-hiroshima-npt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear apocalypse was postponed in 1968.

The review conference of the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty (NPT) involves 191 state party signatories. Few international agreements enjoy such near universal support. Nuclear-armed Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea are shameful hold-outs. Simply put, the NPT is about preventing nuclear war by encouraging disarmament, halting proliferation and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. Up to now, at least, it’s helped stop another nuclear catastrophe. “Another” is the operative word. The 77th anniversary of the first such catastrophe was commemorated on 6 August at Hiroshima, where an estimated 140,000 civilians died, or were condemned to an agonising death, on one day in 1945. To put that in perspective, roughly 10,000 civilians have died in Ukraine in just under six months. Western public opinion, lulled by the end of the cold war, seems to have lost sight of the immeasurable horror of atomic warfare. There are no Greenham Commons nowadays, even though new missile deployments proliferate. If recent events puncture that complacency, it won’t be wholly bad. UN secretary-general António Guterres raised the alarm last week when opening the NPT conference. “Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he warned. “We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict.” Russia illustrates Guterres’s point in terrifying fashion. Having previously seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, in southern Ukraine, it is using it as a fortress from which to fire artillery with impunity. The UN nuclear watchdog says a disaster is in the making. Launching his invasion, Vladimir Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on alert and issued a crude threat. Any western attempt to interfere, he said, “will lead to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”. Whether bluffing or not, Putin’s nuclear blackmail has undoubtedly deterred direct US and Nato intervention in Ukraine and so prolonged the war. Now there’s concern that China may adopt similar tactics over Taiwan. Anti-nuclear campaigners say NPT pledges must be honoured and strengthened, and most countries agree. But the treaty is in trouble all the same. In practice, all five recognised nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France and Britain – are breaking their Article VI treaty commitment to pursue disarmament “in good faith”, thereby setting an execrable example. Instead, a multilateral nuclear arms race is gathering pace, unrestrained in the case of the US and Russia by bilateral cold war arms control treaties discarded by Putin and Donald Trump, and propelled in the case of China by neo-imperial ambition. “All of the nuclear-armed states are increasing or upgrading their arsenals and most are sharpening nuclear rhetoric and the role nuclear weapons play in their military strategies,” the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its authoritative annual report. The US and Russia, while claiming to support further nuclear arms reduction, still maintain 3,708 and 4,477 nukes respectively. China has 350, France 290 and Britain 225. Beijing’s arsenal is predicted to more than double in the next decade. And it’s not only about Armageddon. Growing stockpiles of so-called tactical or battlefield weapons and new hypersonic missiles are making “limited” nuclear warfare more likely. Hypocrisy and double-talk are not confined to the big players. Like Israel, India and Pakistan, Britain and France are modernising their arsenals. President Emmanuel Macron, in true Napoleonic style, wants to extend France’s nuclear shield to cover all of Europe. In a joint statement last week, Britain, France and the US described the NPT as “irreplaceable” and “vital”. They said they were making “enduring efforts” to fulfil their Article VI obligations. Last year, however, Boris Johnson’s government relaxed Britain’s no-first-use doctrine to allow a UK nuclear response to a non-nuclear attack. Ministers also raised the cap on the Trident warhead stockpile and reduced publicly available information. “Both decisions have led many to question the government’s commitment to disarmament,” a House of Commons research paper noted wryly. Even as it extolled the virtues of collaboration, the joint statement castigated Russia for its “irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and reckless attacks endangering nuclear reactors”. It went on: “We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail.” Quite right. But such criticism sits uneasily alongside strictures by Stephen Lovegrove, UK national security adviser, who has warned that a “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, meaning nuclear war, could too easily result from the current shouting match between the west and Russia and China. To make matters worse, North Korea’s rogue regime is expected to conduct a geopolitically (and physically) destabilising underground nuclear test soon. But there are glimmers of hope, too. Last-ditch negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear programme have resumed. Plus 86 countries have now signed the symbolic, nonetheless important, 2021 Nuclear Weapon Ban treaty. Why, as appears the case, is the world teetering ever more precariously on the brink of renewed nuclear catastrophe? There are many factors. Increased insecurity, rising nationalism, weak and stupid leaders, vested commercial interests. Yet as much as anything, the reawakened spectre of nuclear annihilation is the product of a defining 21st-century phenomenon: the increasingly anarchic refusal of states to uphold international law and the UN-underwritten, post-1945 global order. They just won’t stick to the rules, even as they stick it to each other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/06/letters-of-last-resort-pms-early-task-to-write-to-uks-nuclear-sub-commanders","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T16:00:29Z","webTitle":"Letters of last resort: PM’s early task to write to UK’s nuclear sub commanders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/06/letters-of-last-resort-pms-early-task-to-write-to-uks-nuclear-sub-commanders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/06/letters-of-last-resort-pms-early-task-to-write-to-uks-nuclear-sub-commanders","fields":{"bodyText":"It is “the moment when they know what being prime minister is all about”, according to Whitehall historian Lord Hennessy. One of Liz Truss’s early tasks will be to write instructions by hand to each of Britain’s four nuclear submarine commanders, directing them how to respond in the event of an all-out attack that will have killed her and destroyed the UK. They are known as the letters of last resort. But first, Truss will receive a briefing from Britain’s military chiefs on how the Trident nuclear deterrent operates – including the likely military and human consequences of authorising a retaliatory strike. The estimated 40 warheads available on a Vanguard submarine, which carries the Trident missiles, have the capacity to strike multiple cities and kill millions of people. “It is called a deterrent for a reason,” said one naval source. Tony Blair went “quite quiet”, according to Lord Guthrie, the chief of defence staff who briefed him shortly after his 1997 election win. John Major said it was “one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do”. Each warhead is thought to have an explosive yield of 100 kilotonnes, according to David Cullen of the Nuclear Information Service. That is more than six times the 15-kiloton bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the second world war. It is not necessary for Truss to write the letters immediately after the briefing; the new prime minister has time to reflect. The existing letters, written by Boris Johnson, can remain in force, most obviously for the submarine currently out at sea – at least one must be on patrol at all times for the nuclear deterrent to remain continuous. Most previous prime ministers have not disclosed what they have written, although Jim Callaghan said: “If we had got to that point, then I would have done it.” Although he added, if he had in fact survived after having pressed the nuclear button, “I could have never, never forgiven myself”. Theresa May was asked, in a Commons debate on renewing Trident in 2016, whether she was willing to “authorise a nuclear strike that can kill 100,000 innocent men, women and children”. Yes, she replied, adding “the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we would be prepared to use it”. Once written, the letters are delivered, in a safe within a safe, to each of the four submarines. In fact, there are two letters for each submarine, the first of which carries instructions on the final steps that need to be taken before opening the safe with the second, from the prime minister. A commander at sea has many ways to establish whether the UK and its systems of command and control still exists, monitoring a wide range of communications, not just the broadcast of Radio 4. There are also a well-established set of palliative and fall-back mechanisms in the unlikely event of any doubt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/03/first-edition-israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T06:54:06Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: The far right bloc that may deliver power to Benjamin Netanyahu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/first-edition-israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/03/first-edition-israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. When Benjamin Netanyahu lost power last June, he insisted he would be back. “With God’s help,” he said in a valedictory speech, “that will happen much sooner than you think.” 16 months later, he looks all but certain to be prime minister of Israel again. The count of the votes in the country’s fifth election in four years will not be completed until later today, and coalition talks could take weeks to complete. But by the tally so far, Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party is the largest group in the Knesset – and the broad coalition formed to topple him last year looks likely to be thrown into opposition. Even though he has faced corruption charges and remains a sharply divisive figure among voters, the return of “King Bibi” as prime minister isn’t exactly a surprise. The really remarkable thing is who looks like getting him there. As he seeks to cobble together a majority in the Knesset, Netanyahu has turned to a new set of allies on the far right of Israeli politics: the Religious Zionist Party, who want to give IDF soldiers immunity from prosecution and deport “disloyal” Palestinian citizens. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, about the return of Likud, the rise of the Religious Zionists – and how Bibi helped them get there. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Asylum | The Home Office abandoned asylum seekers from the Manston immigration centre in central London without accommodation or warm clothing, the Guardian can reveal. Amid acute overcrowding at Manston, charity volunteers said 11 people were left at Victoria station on Tuesday evening with nowhere to stay. Interest rates | Mortgage rates are expected to jump on Thursday in response to the largest increase in the Bank of England’s base rate since 1989, as the central bank tries to bring down inflation. The base interest rate is expected to go up by 0.75 percentage points to 3%. Poverty | The United Nations’ poverty envoy has warned Rishi Sunak that a new wave of austerity in this month’s budget could violate the UK’s international human rights obligations and increase hunger. Olivier de Schutter said he was “extremely troubled” by likely multibillion-pound spending cuts. Policing | Two Metropolitan police officers have been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment after sharing racist, homophobic, misogynistic and ableist messages in a WhatsApp group with Wayne Couzens before he murdered Sarah Everard. The two men were bailed ahead of an appeal. Media | Eric Allison, who became the Guardian’s prison correspondent aged 60 after spending much of his life in jail, has died aged 79. Former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said Allison “cast a steady light on a world successive governments would rather were kept in the dark”. In depth: The election that proves Israel ‘still lives in a Netanyahu world’ *** What happened in the election? With 88% of votes counted, Benjamin Netanyahu and Likud had a projected 32 seats in the 120-member Knesset – only a little better than the 30 seats which left them in opposition last year. Yesh Atid, the leading left-wing party, actually improved its position from 17 seats to 24. The crucial change is the decline of smaller anti-Netanyahu parties, and the success of the Religious Zionist bloc, which appears on course to win 14 seats – eight up on last time, and enough to give Netanyahu a majority. “Netanyahu has been striking quite a cautious tone,” said Bethan McKernan – admirably lucid after a few hours of sleep. “He’s aware that celebrating too early would be asking for trouble. The mood among Likud members and activists – they’re pretty psyched, but they’re not partying just yet.” *** How did Netanyahu force his way back into office? In the same speech in which he told the Knesset that he would soon be back, Netanyahu vowed to lead “a daily battle against this bad, dangerous, leftwing government to topple it.” He has made good on his word – and was greatly helped by the depth of divisions in a fragile governing coalition which ran from Arab parties and the liberal left to religious nationalists disaffected with Netanyahu’s rule. In this piece from June, Bethan and Quique Kierszenbaum explain how Netanyahu “capitalised on the coalition’s disunity by encouraging the opposition to vote against every bill the coalition proposes, no matter its content, in order to further paralyse his rivals.” Defections destroyed its narrow majority, eventually forcing new elections. While Bibi was not yet back, Noga Tarnopolsky wrote for the Atlantic Council in June, “it is also true that Israel still lives in a Netanyahu world. Here, political reality is filtered through his lens.” But the election results are also a rejection of a diverse government, incorporating voices from Israel’s Arab minority, in favour of a coalition which insists that Israel must be a Jewish state. And it makes the prospect of a two-state solution seem even more distant. Netanyahu was instrumental to the Religious Zionists’ success, Bethan said. “He made this happen. He persuaded three far right parties to merge last year, with the promise of ministerial positions if they succeeded.” The merger was crucial, because it vastly improved their chances of crossing a 3.25% threshold for Knesset representation. “Netanyahu doesn’t like them – he’s always preferred a broader spectrum of parties, including centrists, in his coalition,” Bethan said. “But he would form a coalition with anyone if it would keep him in office.” In this analysis published yesterday, Bethan explains how the Religious Zionists could drag Netanyahu further to the right. If Netanyahu needed any extra motivation, it was provided by the criminal prosecution he faces on corruption charges: the Religious Zionists, and their rising star Itamar Ben-Gvir, have promised support for changes to the legal code which could help him evade conviction. “His personal and professional life were both on the line here,” Bethan said. “He needed to be in office to combat the corruption charges effectively, and he appears to be willing to burn everything down to achieve that.” *** Who is Itamar Ben-Gvir? In a weekend profile of Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose Jewish Strength party is part of the Religious Zionist slate, Bethan explains the toxic politics of the man who is perhaps the greatest beneficiary of Netanyahu’s desire for office. Ben-Gvir (above) has convictions for incitement to racism and supporting an outlawed ultra-nationalist terrorist organisation. He reportedly had “a picture of the terrorist Baruch Goldstein [responsible for the massacre of 29 Palestinian Muslims in 1994] in his living room”. He has toned down the rhetoric since winning a Knesset seat, but still calls for the deportation of “disloyal” Palestinians. Last month he drew a pistol during a confrontation with a group of Palestinian protesters, urging police to shoot them for throwing stones. Other policies include legal immunity for IDF soldiers, and stripping the High Court of the power to strike down unconstitutional laws. “He’s terrifying, frankly,” said Bethan. “He’s charismatic, he’s cheerful, and he works hard – every time there’s a terrorist attack in Israel, he’s immediately there, broadcasting on social media or saying he will stop it if he’s in government, that he has a gun and he’s not afraid to use it.” At a rally Bethan attended to report that piece, “there were teenage girls there, saying, ‘Oh my god, he’s so cute!’ He represents a large and growing proportion of the Jewish Israeli population which is intolerant, and is racist.” She points to August analysis by the Israel Democracy Institute, which found that 62% of Jewish Israelis identify as right-wing – a figure which has risen from 46% in 2019 and is even higher among the 18-24s. Ben-Gvir’s apparent success, she added, comes against a backdrop of violence in the West Bank and inter-community clashes within Israel. “The West Bank is on fire – it’s not quite a third intifada, but it’s not impossible. It’s a stick rather than a carrot for a lot of people. Voters are wary of what Ben-Gvir stands for, but they’d prefer a coherent right wing government to the mess there is now.” *** What happens now? One key question is which ministries Netanyahu will hand to Ben-Gvir and his allies. “The danger is that he will be held hostage by the demands of the far right,” Bethan said. “Ben-Gvir has said he wants the public security ministry: it would allow him to focus on what he wants, which is training police and security forces to do the things he wants to do.” For Arab Israelis, many of whom feel let down by the collapse of a joint list of the parties which represent them, the success of the Religious Zionists appears cause for grave concern. On Monday, Esawi Frej, Israel’s second Muslim cabinet minister and a member of the secular left-wing Meretz party, which appears likely to win no seats, wrote on Twitter: “The third largest party in the Knesset is a racist … violent party that doesn’t want me or my children here. This is no longer a slippery slope. This is the abyss itself.” Such concerns, or warnings from Israel’s international partners against Netanyahu working with the Religious Zionists, appear likely to go unheard. “If this is what his voters want, what’s to stop him?” Bethan asked. “The far right do not care what the rest of the world thinks. They couldn’t give a monkey’s about a statement from Joe Biden. What this means for Palestinian citizens of Israel, and Palestinians in general – the violent settlers who were attacking them, those guys are the government now.” What else we’ve been reading The Guardian has lost two giants in the last week: Ian Jack and now Eric Allison (above).

While the Albanese government insists that no decision has been made on the base, local people have responded angrily to the $368bn 30-year Aukus submarine plan because of reports that Port Kembla is the site most likely for the east coast base. In March 2022, the former prime minister Scott Morrison announced it as one of three potential options for a new naval facility, along with Brisbane and Newcastle. Mick Cross, the secretary of the southern New South Wales branch of the Maritime Union of Australia, said the alternative plans for the Port Kembla outer harbour were as a base to develop offshore windfarms and a smaller overflow terminal for containers, instead of Port Botany. “The government has a choice, we don’t see how they could have one of the biggest investments in offshore wind in the world, $43bn, as well as an east coast base,” he told Guardian Australia, citing comments by the NSW Ports boss, Marika Calfas. “We don’t want that jeopardised by a quick, ill-thought-out decision to put a nuclear submarine base here. “I challenge anyone to tell me there are more jobs in a nuclear sub base than offshore wind.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The South Coast Labour Council secretary, Arthur Rorris, told reporters on Tuesday the base amounted to a “a nuclear submarine parking lot, not a shipbuilding base”, which would put “a nuclear target on our backs”. Greg Rodgers, the president of the Port Kembla chamber of commerce, stood beside Rorris agreeing that the majority of jobs from Aukus would go to South Australia and Perth, so it would be preferable for Port Kembla to take “the overflow from Port Botany”. NSW Ports said in a statement that it had “not been provided with any information” about an east coast base, but said any defence proposal must not “adversely impact commercial port operations or constrain port growth”. The Labor MP for Cunningham, Alison Byrnes, told Guardian Australia that the decision would be informed by the defence strategic review, out next month, and no decision had been taken yet. Byrnes promised to hold a “community leaders’ briefing about the process”, citing the government’s “strong track record of consultation, collaboration and engagement”. “Unlike the former Liberal government, we will not rush to make a flashy defence announcement.” On Tuesday the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said there had been a lot of “conjecture” about the east coast base, urging critics to “take a very deep breath”. “It is the case that the former government announced the need for an east coast base, but we are taking our time here and all of that is a long way into the future.” The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said this comment put a “significant question mark” over the east coast base, which was needed to attract a workforce of submariners because “not everyone wants to live on the west coast”. “I suspect what’s happening here is they’re delaying an announcement on that until after the NSW state election,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/putin-nuclear-ukraine-biden-russian-forces-nato-kremlin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-17T14:25:45Z","webTitle":"What happens if Putin goes nuclear in Ukraine? Biden has a choice to make","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/putin-nuclear-ukraine-biden-russian-forces-nato-kremlin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/putin-nuclear-ukraine-biden-russian-forces-nato-kremlin","fields":{"bodyText":"There has been much excited talk of a “turning point” following Ukraine’s rapid military advances in north-eastern Kharkiv region and what Kyiv cheerily calls its “de-occupation” by fleeing Russians. Less comforting for the western democracies is an alternative theory: that the war is approaching “a moment of maximum danger”. Worries that a cornered, desperate Vladimir Putin may resort to nuclear, chemical or biological weapons have resurfaced in the US and Europe, along with the argument, articulated by France’s Emmanuel Macron, that Russia’s president, despite his terrible crimes, should not be “humiliated” – and allowed a way out. Speaking last week, US president Joe Biden said any use by Putin of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Ukraine – for example, by exploding a low-yield, tactical nuclear warhead – would “change the face of war”. Russia would become “more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been,” he said. Yet even as he warned the US response would be “consequential”, Biden refused to say whether it would involve commensurate US or Nato military action. The tenor of his remarks suggested he has not personally raised the nuclear issue with Russia’s leader. This renewed angst about WMD reflects the trap Putin set for the west when he launched his invasion. By placing Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, deploying nuclear-capable missiles closer to Nato states, and targeting Chornobyl and then the giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, he and flunkeys such as Dmitry Medvedev deliberately played up fears of Armageddon. They hoped to weaken backing for Kyiv and deter direct Nato intervention. It has worked so far. The US and Nato walked into the trap from the get-go. While supplying Ukraine with ever increasing amounts of arms and materiel, Biden and his allies continue to limit the power, range and quality of such weapons to ensure Putin’s position is not so weakened that he turns to extreme measures. As a result Nato is still not providing the tanks, missile defences and the air cover Ukrainian forces need to secure liberated areas and press home their advantage. Germany and others take their cue from Washington. Last week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz again demanded Putin withdraw from all Ukrainian territory – while withholding the Leopard tanks Kyiv says are necessary to achieve this end. The Putin trap has other malign aspects, notably the Kremlin’s economic blitzkrieg on Europe. In effect it is using gas and oil to explode cost-of-living bombshells in every private home, shop and factory. EU politicians who thought they could reason with Putin are enmeshed in the very war-like confrontation they sought to avoid. Some are wavering. Putin’s meeting last week with Xi Jinping does not seem to have gone smoothly, with China’s president echoing Indian criticism of the damaging global impact of the war. But their overall “no limits” partnership appears unaffected. Their shared aim: the evisceration of the post-1945, western-led rules-based order. In this context, Ukraine and Taiwan are prologue. The uncovering in newly liberated Kharkiv of Bucha-type mass graves and apparent war crimes represents another strand of Putin’s strategy of demotivation. His message to the west: your “universal values” are meaningless in the world I am creating. By contemptuously violating the UN’s authority, the Geneva conventions, and human rights law, he strikes at the heart of western self-belief and confidence. Not exactly a turning point, then, but a week when other myths were also exploded. Demolished is the defeatist argument that Ukraine cannot prevail and that western military and economic aid only delays the inevitable. Ukraine is winning, for now at least, despite the humming and hawing. Nor is it any longer assumed Putin’s grip on power is unshakeable. Increasing domestic criticism is heard, not least from his pro-war, nationalist supporters. Their ire is currently aimed at the military high command, but everyone knows who commands the commanders. Now is not the time to relax the pressure for fear of what Putin might do. On the contrary, it’s time to crank it up. Because, ironically, it’s Putin who is trapped now. He must not escape the consequences of his actions. For Europe (and the UK), this means expanding the too modest energy measures proposed by EU commission president Ursula van der Leyen last week – and end energy dependence on Moscow. It means sending more, better heavy weapons to Kyiv and redoubling efforts to inform Russians about what, truly, is being done in their name. It means creating an international criminal tribunal for Ukraine, like that for former Yugoslavia, and the confiscation of frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund reparations, compensation and the rebuilding of the country. It means deploying a military coalition of the willing to secure Zaporizhzhia, as Lithuania proposes. Daunting challenges remain. Russia still has more tanks and artillery. It still controls one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory. It is mobilising 137,000 additional troops on Putin’s orders and could outnumber its opponents by spring. A ruthless campaign of indiscriminate reprisals against civilian targets has begun, following its recent setbacks. “There is little he [Putin] won’t do when he feels it is necessary to win on the battlefield,” warned analyst Daniel Davis, a retired US army colonel. But this is not an argument for cutting him some slack. Don’t give him an inch. Keep him on the run. Show him there’s no way out but back. And if, panicked and vengeful, Putin does indeed threaten to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the response must be hard and clear. Biden must personally and formally inform him, in advance, that any such attack, breaking the global taboo on nuclear aggression and undercutting international security, would be viewed as an act of war against the US and Nato – with all the awesome, regime-toppling consequences that might entail. Perhaps Biden has already done this. Hopefully he has. In which case, stop pulling western punches. Get on and ensure Ukraine wins, wins well, and wins soon.

Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Stoltenberg said Turkey, the last country to ratify Finland’s membership, would hand its official texts to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday. Stoltenberg said he would then invite Finland to do the same. Stoltenberg’s announcement prompted a warning from Russia that it would bolster its defences near their joint border if Nato deployed any troops inside the country. “We will strengthen our military potential in the west and in the north-west,” Grushko said in remarks carried by the RIA Novosti state news agency. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, Stoltenberg said. He was speaking as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels on Tuesday to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 villagers in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne on Monday, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday, an IAEA spokesperson said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. President Zelenskiy has said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However, there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made premature claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he hosted a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. Police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect and that she was arrested in a flat in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, according to a report. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Gershkovich’s arrest was “of concern” and called for his “immediate release”. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the White House said on Monday. Many people could have wanted to kill Vladlen Tatarsky, the pro-war Russian blogger who died in a bomb blast in a St Petersburg cafe on Sunday. Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, was notorious for his vehement support for the invasion of Ukraine, where he regularly called for Russia to commit to a total war and advocated for extreme violence that included war crimes. “We’ll defeat everyone, we’ll kill everyone, we’ll loot whoever we need to, and everything will be just as we like it,” he said last year on camera after a Kremlin ceremony confirming the “annexation” of four Ukrainian regions. A former coalminer from east Ukraine, Fomin was convicted of bank robbery and was serving a prison sentence in east Ukraine when Russian proxy forces launched their war against the government. Fomin claimed he then fled custody and joined the Russian-backed forces. Later, he became a blogger and moved to Moscow several years before Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022. After the war began, he claimed to have joined a volunteer battalion and fought in Mariupol. At the beginning of the war he became a member of a small but influential group of military bloggers who have been vocally supportive of the conflict, regularly posting updates citing troops on the frontlines or dangling scoops about potential offensives or big political decisions such as mobilisations. At the same time, they have also been some of the most virulent critics of Russia’s military effort, condemning the army’s top brass as ineffective and lazy, and uncaring for the lives of Russian troops sent into battle. Read the full story here: The German arms maker Rheinmetall is building a military maintenance and logistics hub in Satu Mare, Romania, that is expected to begin operation this month to service weapons used for the war in Ukraine, the company has said. The hub, located near the Ukrainian border, will service self-propelled howitzers, Leopard 2 and Challenger tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Fuchs armoured transport vehicles and military trucks, it said. A Rheinmetall spokesperson said on Sunday: The service hub should play a central role in maintaining the operational readiness of western combat systems in use in Ukraine and ensuring the availability of logistical support. The chief executive of the company, Armin Papperger, said it was a “key concern” to provide Nato forces and Ukraine “with the best possible support”. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, travelled to Romania today for talks with its president, Klaus Iohannis, that focused on security, economy and energy. They also discussed defence cooperation on Nato’s eastern flank and security in the Black Sea region. Scholz highlighted the strong relations between Germany and Romania and again promised to “give Ukraine military support for as long as it is necessary, and we are working on that constantly and together”. He did not directly answer questions on the Rheinmetall facility being set up in Romania. Iohannis and Scholz were later joined by Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, for talks on ways to support her embattled country. Moldova is Ukraine’s “most vulnerable neighbour”, Mandu told reporters, adding that “when our values are under attack, democratic countries must help each other”. Ukraine has received the first $2.7bn (£2.2bn) tranche under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) extended fund facility programme, finance minister Sergii Marchenko has said. The IMF said on Friday that its executive board had approved a four-year $15.6bn (£12.6bn) loan programme for Ukraine, part of a global $115bn (£92.8bn) package to support the country’s economy as it battles Russia’s invasion. The extended fund facility (EFF) loan is the first major conventional financing programme approved by the IMF for a country involved in a large-scale war. The decision cleared the way for the immediate disbursement of $2.7bn to Kyiv, and requires Ukraine to carry out ambitious reforms, especially in the energy sector, the Fund said in a statement. While we’re on the subject of western aid for Ukraine, the White House has said the US will send a new package of assistance to Ukraine this week. Ukraine is still fighting hard for the eastern city of Bakhmut and the battle is not over, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help the country in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said. “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security,” Stoltenberg told a news conference as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels tomorrow to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. Earlier we reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Yahidne in northern Ukraine, where nearly 400 residents were kept captive in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. Eleven people died during the ordeal, Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian leader was joined on the visit to the village in Chernihiv region by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. Zelenskiy thanked Habeck and Burić for attending and said the basement was important for Ukraine’s allies to see. He said: It’s important to see this and to be in these basements to understand whether to help Ukraine or to keep thinking how to find a way to talk with Russia. Russian troops and the country’s leadership, including Vladimir Putin, were responsible for the tragedy, he said. He added: Having seen all this, I can wish the president of Russia to spend the rest of his days in a basement with a bucket for a toilet. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on espionage charges, the White House has said. National security council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters: We have been pushing hard since the moment we found out the reporter was detained. The US is “keenly, strongly, closely” tracking his detention, he added. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has said its head, Rafael Grossi, will travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad territory on Wednesday for talks on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies had earlier reported that Grossi would visit Moscow, citing a senior diplomat. But a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said he would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. Grossi will visit Kaliningrad “as part of his ongoing consultations aimed at ensuring the protection of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant during the military conflict”, the IAEA spokesperson said. Grossi visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is in territory occupied by Russia since early in its invasion, last week. He said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said.

Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, has said Moscow will strengthen its military in its western and north-western regions in response to Finland joining Nato tomorrow. He told Russian state-owned Ria news agency: In the event that the forces and resources of other Nato members are deployed in Finland, we will take additional steps to reliably ensure Russia’s military security. Finland has a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, and joining Nato will roughly double the alliance’s frontier facing Moscow. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, Interfax news agency reported, citing the court. Gershkovich, 31, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, was detained on Wednesday in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg and accused by Russia’s FSB internal security agency of collecting “classified information” on a company in its military industrial complex. The WSJ says it “vehemently denies the allegations” and the White House has described the charges as “ridiculous”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 residents of a village in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. He said that 11 people died during the ordeal. “These people somehow lived and waited for Ukraine in the dark,” said Zelenskiy, who appeared visibly moved on the anniversary. “They lived standing and sitting.” Reuters reports that Zelenskiy was joined on the visit to Yahidne, a village in Chernihiv region, by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy wrote: I want to thank the residents of Yahidne. They endured torture, a terrible path, the path of absolute heroes. I thank Ukraine for having such fighters for life. Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef, the UN children’s fund, has commented on the announcement by the OHCHR Ukraine civilian casualty update team that the number of children killed in the conflict since February 2022 has risen to at least 501. She said: This is another tragic milestone for Ukraine’s children and families. Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, at least 501 children have been killed. This is just the UN-verified number. The real figure is likely far higher, and the toll on families affected is unimaginable. Almost 1,000 children have been injured, leaving them with wounds and scars – both visible and invisible – that could last for life. Children and families in Ukraine are paying the highest price for this brutal war. Behind every number is a family torn apart and changed for ever. It is heart-wrenching. War is always the worst enemy of children, whether in Ukraine, or countless other conflicts around the world. Every child, no matter where they live, deserves to grow up in a peaceful environment. Tatiana Moskalkova, commissioner for human rights in the Russian Federation, has told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass that Ukraine and Russia have swapped five injured prisoners of war in recent days. It quotes her saying: “Today, five wounded servicemen of the armed forces of Ukraine have been repatriated to Ukraine. We continue to work in this direction.” Tass reports that according to her, at the end of March, Ukraine handed over five wounded Russian soldiers who are currently being treated. “I wish them a speedy recovery and I believe that they will soon return to their families and friends, who will greet them as real heroes,” she is reported as saying. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last day, in the Ukrainian-held areas of Kherson region, pyrotechnicians defused 56 explosive object in de-occupied settlements. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Wednesday, Russia’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told state television on Monday. Reuters reports Ulyanov said Grossi would meet a Russian delegation and that they would discuss the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, located in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russian forces captured Europe’s largest nuclear power station in March 2022, and since then have been forcing Ukrainian staff to continue to operate it. Both sides have accused the other of shelling the power plant and risking a nuclear accident. Grossi recently visited and inspected the plant for a second time since the war began. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has called for the “immediate release” of the US national Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in Russia last week. Stoltenberg, speaking at a news conference, said he joined the US in their call on Russia to release Gershkovich. He added: His arrest is of concern. It is important to respect freedom of the press, the rights of journalists, and the rights to ask questions and to do their jobs. Therefore, we call on his immediate release. Russian police have been pictured guarding the site of yesterday’s explosion in a cafe in central St Petersburg that killed the prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Tributes have been laid near the scene of the blast, which took place as Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. More than 30 people were wounded and 10 of them remain in grave condition from the explosion, according to authorities. Police have arrested a woman, Darya Trepova, whom they have identified as the suspect. Authorities claim she was a supporter of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Belarus has started combat readiness inspections of its armed forces, the defence ministry has said in a statement published on Telegram. The ministry said inspections would determine the capacity of military units to perform at “the highest levels of combat readiness”.

Nato has not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture since Vladimir Putin’s announcement that he would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Stoltenberg says. So far, we haven’t seen any changes in their nuclear posture that requires any change, changing our nuclear posture. Nato’s position on Ukraine’s bid “remains unchanged” and that is that “Ukraine will become a member of the alliance”, Stoltenberg says. The main focus however is to “ensure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”, he says. So the first and most urgent step is for Kyiv’s allies to sustain and further step up military, lethal, non-lethal and economic support to Ukraine, he says. Nato is also looking into how it can develop a political relationship with Ukraine, and how it can expand its work on more long-term reforms in institutional building, he says. It is extremely important to continue to demonstrate that Nato’s door remains open, as we’ll do tomorrow, when Finland will become a full member. As we do when we finalise the accession process for Sweden hopefully in the near future. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been speaking at a news conference after the announcement that Finland will officially join the military alliance tomorrow. Finland joining Nato on Tuesday “will be a good day for Finland’s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole”, he says. On the subject of Sweden – which applied to join Nato at the same time as Finland last May but whose membership bid is still being blocked by Turkey – Stoltenberg said the raising of Finland’s flag “is also good for Sweden”. He says he will continue to work on finalising the Swedish accession process. Finland will officially become a member of the Nato military alliance on Tuesday, the Finnish president’s office has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, confirmed Finland will join the alliance tomorrow. Germany’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, has been pictured arriving in Kyiv for talks in an unannounced visit. A spokesperson for Germany’s energy and economy ministry confirmed the visit, saying Habeck, who also serves as minister for energy and the economy, arrived in the Ukrainian capital early today. Habeck was accompanied by a small business delegation including Siegfried Russwurm, president of the federation of German industries. It is Habeck’s first visit to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Habeck said the aim of the talks was to “give Ukraine hope” that the country will be rebuilt after the war. He said the purpose of his visit was to send a clear signal to Kyiv: A signal that we believe it will be victorious, that it will be rebuilt, that there is an interest from Europe not only to support it in times of need, but that Ukraine will also be an economically strong partner in the future. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. Przydacz, in an interview with Polish radio RMF today, said: According to my information, this process has already been completed, i.e., the transfer of this first part. Of course, there will be talks about possible further support. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Duda said at the time: We still have a dozen of these [aircraft]. We got them in the early 1990s from the East German army. These are the last years of their operation in accordance with their technical capabilities but are still functional. Kyiv has urged its allies to provide fighter jets to defend its airspace and more effectively counterattack the Russian forces on its territory. So far, only Poland and Slovakia, which approved the transfer of 13 MiG-29 jets, have answered that call. We reported earlier that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. We have some more details of the visit. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. He has held a number of secret working meetings in the country while travelling to other countries. The visit will begin with an official meeting at the royal castle between Zelenskiy and Duda, with the pair expected to discuss security issues, regional politics, and economic cooperation, as well as the transit of Ukrainian grain and other farm produce through Poland, according to Marcin Przydacz, the head of Duda’s international office. The talks with be followed by a meeting with the public, according to Duda’s office. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, regarding regional security, the situation at the front, and bilateral cooperation including the situation at border crossings and with Ukrainian grain, according to Morawiecki aide Michal Dworczyk. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb explosion as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.” The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol. It reports the city administration said a car was blown up in the city centre, and that one person was injured. The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has arrived in Ukraine on a surprise visit, the German energy and economy ministry has said, in his first trip to the country since the outbreak of war. Poland’s president has said he expects Zelenskiy, to visit on 5 April. The visit would coincide with the next summit of Nato foreign ministers, which is taking place in Brussels, and which the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is expected to attend. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Our video team have also put together this report on the death of Vladlen Tatarsky at the weekend. Pjotr Sauer rounds up the latest developments after Sunday’s St Petersburg café explosion: Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian news reports said the bomb was hidden in a bust of the blogger that the suspect had given to him as a gift moments before the explosion, which also wounded more than 30 people. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg following a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Tatarsky, who had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram, was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. He emerged as one of the loudest critics of Russia’s defence ministry over the last year for its inability to achieve military gains in Ukraine, and frequently travelled with Russian troops on the frontlines. In one instance he called for a tribunal for the Russian military leadership, describing Moscow’s top officers as “untrained idiots”. He was also among the attendees at a Kremlin ceremony last September where Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia’s annexation of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine, a move widely condemned by the international community.

However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature.

Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that the suspect in the explosion that killed military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been detained by the authorities. She has been named as Daria Trepova. Tass quotes a statement from employees of the investigative committee which says: On suspicion of involvement in the explosion in a cafe in St Petersburg, employees of the Russian investigative committee, together with operational services, detained Daria Trepova. Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram and was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. More than 30 people were wounded in the blast on Sunday. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours, Russian forces have shelled 16 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Russia’s interior ministry on Monday named a woman called Darya Trepova as a suspect in the killing of prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a St Petersburg cafe and placed her on its wanted list, Reuters reports, citing Interfax.

In case you missed it, the Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Pjotr Sauer and Tom Phillips have the story of a pair of highly unusual Russian spies who left emotional devastation in their wake when they fled back to Russia earlier this year, amid fears they were about to be unmasked. Gerhard Daniel Campos Wittich managed 3D printing companies in Brazil, which among other things produced novelty resin sculptures for the Brazilian military and sausage dog key chains. His alleged wife, Irina Romanova, posed as a Greek-Mexican photographer named Maria Tsalla and ran a knitting supplies shop in Athens. Here’s an excerpt: Illegals often work in pairs as married couples, but the case of Campos Wittich and Tsalla is the first alleged example of two halves of an illegal couple working in separate countries with separate lives. “We have very little doubt that they were married,” said the Greek official, adding that it was an unusual case. He claimed that the pair had engineered meetings in Greece, Cyprus and France in recent times, possibly romantic encounters mixed with espionage catch-ups. Interviews in Greece and Brazil suggest both halves of the couple left emotional devastation in the wake of their hurried departures. Both had long-term romantic partners in their cover identities, who had no suspicion they were involved with Russian spies. Campos Wittich lived for at least two years in Rio with his Brazilian girlfriend, who coordinated the social media search for him when he disappeared. She is a veterinarian who works for the country’s ministry of agriculture. Read on here: Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Russia said in January that it had produced the first set of the Poseidon torpedoes, four years after president Vladimir Putin announced the fundamentally new type of strategic nuclear weapon, confirming it would have its own nuclear power supply, according to Reuters. In late March, Russia said that the coastal infrastructure for the submarines that would carry the Poseidon torpedoes will be finished on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where Russia’s Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located. “The decision to form a division of special-purpose nuclear submarines in Kamchatka has been made,” Tass cited an unidentified defence source as saying. “We are talking about December 2024 or the first half of 2025.” There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but military analysts say it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Citing several people familiar with the matter, the paper’s Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon writes in a paywalled report: The increased pressure reflects deep suspicion in the Kremlin and FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, about the loyalty of Russia’s civilian elite, many of whom privately oppose the war in Ukraine and are chafing over its impact on their lifestyles. A spokesperson for Putin confirmed that Russia had tightened its restrictions on foreign travel for some people workers in “sensitive” areas. The assassination of prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, may reveal further fractures within the Kremlin and its inner circle, the US-based Institute for the Study of War has written in its daily analysis. The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Kyiv for the attack – which took place in a St Petersburg cafe reportedly belonging to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin – and praised Russian military bloggers for their war coverage, “seemingly ignoring the fact that Fomin and other milbloggers routinely criticize the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Russian Foreign Ministry,” ISW analysts wrote. They also noted that Prigozhin stated on 2 April that he would not “blame the Kyiv regime” for the deaths of Fomin and Russian ultranationalist figure Daria Dugina, who was assassinated in August, suggesting that Ukrainian agents were not in fact responsible. The ISW continued: Fomin’s assassination at Prigozhin’s bar is likely part of a larger pattern of escalating Russian internal conflicts involving Prigozhin and Wagner. Fomin had attended another event earlier in the day without incident, so it appears that the attack was deliberately staged in a space owned by Prigozhin. Advisor to Ukrainian Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak stated that Fomin’s death was a result of antifighting and political competition among Russian actors. Some Russian political analysts also speculated that Prigozhin was supposed to attend Fomin’s event, although there is no confirmation of that speculation. Fomin’s assassination may have been intended as a warning to Prigozhin, who has been increasingly questioning core Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and even obliquely signaling an interest in the Russian presidency, whether in competition with Putin or as his successor.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. “I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut... Especially Bakhmut! It’s especially hot there today!” he said in his nightly address without elaborating further. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building, according to Reuters. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian forces have for months been trying to encircle and capture Bakhmut, a town of 70,000 before the Russian invasion launched over a year ago. Prigozhin, in an audio message posted on his press service’s Telegram account, said: From a legal point of view, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western parts.” A senior Ukrainian official had earlier described the situation around the town as “tense,” with the military command carefully considering every move. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces were continuing to defend their positions, with Russian forces paying scant attention to their losses as they mounted attacks. The situation in Bakhmut remains tense,” Maliar said on Telegram. “But every military decision and every step is weighed carefully ... We respond to the prevailing situation appropriately, taking into account all circumstances, tasks and the principle of military feasibility.” Zelenskiy and military commanders agreed last month to maintain the defence of Bakhmut amid public debate over whether it was best to remain or adopt other defensive positions. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Associated Press reports: Ambassador Boris Gryzlov’s comment followed Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Russia’s neighbour and ally. The announcement marked another attempt by the Russian leader to dangle the nuclear threat to discourage the west from supporting Ukraine. Putin has said that construction of storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus will be complete by 1 July and added that Russia has helped modernise Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The two neighbours have an agreement envisioning close economic, political and military ties. Russia used Belarusian territory as a staging ground for invading Ukraine and has maintained a contingent of troops and weapons there. Gryzlov, speaking in remarks broadcast late Sunday by Belarusian state television, said the Russian nuclear weapons will be “moved up close to the western border of our union state” but did not give any precise location. “It will expand our defence capability, and it will be done regardless of all the noise in Europe and the United States,” he said in a reference to western criticism of Putin’s decision. Belarus shares a 1,250-kilometre border with Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Tactical nuclear weapons, which are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared with nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities. The deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would put them closer to potential targets in Ukraine and Nato members in Eastern and Central Europe. Belarus’ authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko said Friday that some of Russia’s strategic nuclear weapons might be deployed to Belarus along with part of Russia’s tactical nuclear arsenal. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Our top story this morning: Russia’s ambassador to Belarus says Moscow will deploy tactical nuclear weapons close to Belarus’s border with Nato neighbours Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The comment follows Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The weapons “will be moved to the western border of our union state and will increase the possibilities to ensure security”, Boris Gryzlov told Belarusian state television. “This will be done despite the noise in Europe and the United States.” We’ll have more on this stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been killed in a blast at a cafe in central St Petersburg, Russia’s interior ministry has said. Russian media said a bomb was hidden in a statue presented to Tatarsky in a box as a gift. Another 30 people were injured. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has called for Russia to free the detained American journalist Evan Gershkovich in a rare phone call with his Moscow counterpart. The American’s plea was rejected by Sergei Lavrov, who responded by saying that US officials and media outlets must “not make a fuss” or try to politicise the plight of the Wall Street Journal reporter. More than three dozen editors of news organisations from across the world have signed a letter condemning Gershkovich’s detention. “Russia is sending the message that journalism within your borders is criminalized and that foreign correspondents seeking to report from Russia do not enjoy the benefits of the rule of law,” says the letter. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the heavily fought over city of Bakhmut is “especially hot” right now. The comment, in his regular evening address, came as the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that his forces had raised the Russian flag over Bakhmut’s administration building. Prigozhin has issued some premature success claims before and the Guardian could not verify his claim. Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ oil producers including Russia have announced further cuts in their production amounting to around 1.16 million barrels per day in a surprise move that analysts said would cause an immediate rise in prices. Russia has suffered up to 200,000 casualties in the war in Ukraine but a “significant number” of these are due to “non-combat causes”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. “Other leading causes of non-combat casualties likely include poor weapon handing drills, road traffic accidents and climatic injuries such as hypothermia,” it said. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/20/the-aukus-deal-is-a-against-the-worlds-climate-future-it-didnt-have-to-be-like-this","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-20T02:07:09Z","webTitle":"The Aukus deal is a crime against the world’s climate future.

What else might be happening then? According to the IPCC, at current rates, the planet will have warmed more than 1.5C above its pre-industrial state. In fact, many scientists believe temperatures could smash the 1.5C barrier as soon as 2030 or 2035 – that is, around about when Australia receives the first of its Virginia-class nuclear subs. Warming on that scale means extreme weather becoming common. It means disasters like the 2019/20 bushfire season or the 2022 floods taking place not once in a century, but every year or so. It means drought and heatwaves disrupting food production, it means rising seas inundating the land, and it means millions of people fleeing regions suddenly rendered uninhabitable. When you think about what the Australian people might require under such ghastly conditions, “nuclear submarines” do not top the list. Back in 2019, Scott Morrison responded to a Greta Thunberg speech by saying that he didn’t want children to feel “needless anxiety” about global warming. That bizarre insouciance about climate science still pervades the national security establishment, even as the Age and Sydney Morning Herald’s “Red alert” panellists demand a “psychological shift” to ready Australians for a major war. The submarine enthusiasts don’t care that the geostrategic environment for which their vessels are designed won’t exist as ecological collapse reshapes world politics. Rather, they consider the eye-popping sums associated with Aukus (“the biggest transfer of wealth from Australia to another country in its history”) as an immediate down payment on the US alliance, integrating Australia into the forces propping up declining American hegemony in the Asia Pacific. Yet the rest of us should think long and hard about what that means. With this deal, Anthony Albanese has now pledged vastly more money for hi-tech weaponry than Australia’s ever spent on preventing global warming. The $368bn allocated to nuclear submarines that may or may not ever arrive could, for example, have delivered a renewable energy grid, not once, nor twice but four times over. Yet, instead of a zero carbon energy system, we’ve acquired a gigantic bill, one that will almost inevitably climb – the Australian military’s acquisitions often run billions of dollars over budget. No future government will dare abandon the Morrison/Albanese commitment. On the contrary, every politician will invoke submarines to justify underfunding environmental and social programs. Already, Peter Dutton suggests buttressing Aukus with cuts to the NDIS – a small taste of what’s to come. It didn’t have to be like this. “For the first time in the modern era,” notes the Financial Review’s Aaron Patrick, “the left of the Left [in the ALP] controls power at the national level.” Yet Labor has persisted with its “small target” strategy on emissions, so far refusing to ban new fossil fuel developments despite the increasingly desperate pleas from António Guterres and Fatih Birol. The “left of the Left” has expended its political capital not on a transformational climate policy but on a deal conceived by, of all people, Scott Morrison, a military expansion that not so long ago even the right of the Liberal party would have considered a khaki fever dream. Let’s be real: Aukus makes the already huge task of decarbonisation far, far more difficult. If we were to consider the world’s militaries as a single country, their combined carbon footprint constitutes the fourth largest national contribution in the world. An arms race in the Asia Pacific and beyond will enrich the defence companies contributing to funding the Australian Strategic Policy Institute but it will derail the international cooperation necessary to cut emissions, as all the main powers throw resources into their own polluting fleets. An actual conflict would be infinitely worse. A Sino-US war would mean a world-historic catastrophe, both because of its likely escalation to a nuclear exchange, but also because it would lock in an environmental future immeasurably bleaker than the already grim projections of the IPCC. The fighting in Ukraine has already resulted in vast amounts of greenhouse gases. What do you suppose two clashing superpowers would do? That’s why the Age/Sydney Morning Herald Red Alert series was so extraordinarily irresponsible. If war is really as imminent as these “experts” claim, we don’t need conscription or atomic weaponry or other blithely mentioned nostrums. We need, rather, to redouble efforts for peace, simply because a conflict between nuclear powers would seal our environmental death warrant. No one should have illusions about Chinese dictators and their regime. But Iraq and Afghanistan provide an awful warning that military assaults on authoritarian regimes do not culminate in democracy and freedom, but instead intensify the misery inflicted upon ordinary people. In 1953, Dwight Eisenhower spelled out what the first cold war race signified, saying, “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed.” We know, with a level approaching certainty, that climate change is coming. So how else can we think about Australian’s unprecedented new arms expenditure other than as an awful crime against the future? • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2023/mar/20/antidote-review-ayahuasca-tourism-film-lauds-hallucinogenic-teas-healing-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-20T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Antidote review – ayahuasca tourism film lauds hallucinogenic tea’s healing powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/antidote-review-ayahuasca-tourism-film-lauds-hallucinogenic-teas-healing-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/mar/20/antidote-review-ayahuasca-tourism-film-lauds-hallucinogenic-teas-healing-powers","fields":{"bodyText":"Often mocked by standup comedians and sitcom writers – a sure sign of its ubiquity – ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic tea, has brought an influx of western travellers going on healing retreats to the forests of Peru. Focusing on its medicinal properties, Marc Silver’s documentary aims to dispel certain misconceptions about the psychedelic brew. Among Indigenous people, rituals involving ayahuasca have been practised for millennia. Made from vines and other plant extracts, the concoction relieves patients of physical and mental traumas. The cure also carries a ceremonial aspect; the taking of the medicine is at times accompanied by songs and chants. Once deemed satanic by Catholic missionaries during colonial times, ayahuasca ironically now finds new converts among foreigners, whose vivid testimonials of their powerful hallucinations are recounted in detail. Nevertheless, this film seems either unwilling or ill-equipped to tackle the thornier aspects of the ayahuasca tourism boom. For example, what is the material relationship between the local community and the organisers of these wellness residencies? As well as assuming the role of a guiding force during ayahuasca ceremonies, Indigenous people also provide the meals and accommodation. Is this labour fairly compensated? Furthermore, the film touches on the environmental threat of oil companies encroaching on Indigenous land yet neglects to examine the sustainability of ayahuasca tourism. Could it in fact be another form of capitalist exploitation and extraction of natural resources masquerading as wellness? Though commendable in its attempt to understand ayahuasca as a legitimate and effective form of alternative medicine, Antidote suffers from a lack of intellectual rigour that leaves the final product seeming like a glossy travel brochure. • Antidote is released on 24 March in cinemas"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/10/power-to-the-people-is-a-lovely-idea-gordon-brown-but-you-forgot-about-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-10T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"Power to the people is a lovely idea, Gordon Brown, but you forgot about women | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/10/power-to-the-people-is-a-lovely-idea-gordon-brown-but-you-forgot-about-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/10/power-to-the-people-is-a-lovely-idea-gordon-brown-but-you-forgot-about-women","fields":{"bodyText":"Nik Johnson. Andy Burnham. Steve Rotheram. Jamie Driscoll. Oliver Coppard. Ben Houchen. Andy Street. Dan Norris. And – ta-da! – Tracy Brabin: the first person to prove that it’s possible to be both female and a metro mayor. This welcome indication that the eminent local leaders are not after all long-delayed male revenge for women’s suffrage, also made Brabin a great asset at Gordon Brown’s presentation, last week, of a plan for constitutional reform in which metro mayors are to be key regional actors. With their help, Brown proposes giving “the people of Britain more power and control over our lives and the decisions that matter to us”. To see Brabin appear with Starmer at the launch of Brown’s report, “A New Britain”, was to imagine – assuming you hadn’t read the document in question – that Brown really is a changed person since as premier he favoured male colleagues to the point, Caroline Flint complained, of using women as “female window dressing”. This tendency was later confirmed by Harriet Harman’s disclosure that her role at an international summit – after Brown had failed to make her deputy prime minister, despite her winning a vote to succeed John Prescott – was “inclusion at the No 10 dinner for the G20 leader’s wives”. Happily for Brown, these are more forgiving times. If prominent critics noticed that the word “women” appears only once in his evisceration of the status quo and great vision for improving on it, they evidently found it unremarkable. And, to be fair, Brown did allude to sex, almost, in one subsequent defence of his plan, deploring “the long era of ‘the man in Whitehall knows best’ ”. Readers of his report will appreciate, however, that it is the “Whitehall” part of that arrangement that upsets him. While various opponents have dwelt, as Brown complains, on allegedly unrealistic aspects of his plan for enhanced democracy, he has so far avoided criticism for one of its basic difficulties, that of women’s under-representation in politically influential positions (likewise that of ethnic minorities and disabled people). And maybe it’s useful to be reminded that feminist notions of equal representation have become something so many of our leading idealists can now treat as settled, if not quaint. Brown is not alone in overlooking that recent illustration of the impact of women’s exclusion from senior positions: the sidelining of women’s concerns during a pandemic that caused disproportionate damage to women’s livelihoods. “Any economic plan will fail unless the right powers are in the right places in the hands of the right people,” Brown writes. Women’s representation in local government currently stands at a (record-breaking) 41% of councillors in England; 22% of council leaders and one out of nine metro mayors. Any credible plan for redistributing power needs to reassure women they will not be subject to decision-making by regional bodies composed along the lines of, say, West Midlands metro mayor Andy Street’s combined authority board (24 men, nine women), or Andy Burnham’s (nine men, three women). Not that the figures for Westminster – 34% women in the Commons, 28% in the Lords, 23% in the cabinet – are calculated to inspire local action to improve women’s involvement in decision-making. Last year, the Fawcett Society found that three-quarters of local councils do not have maternity or paternity policies for councillors. It’s possible, of course, that the near-zero appearance of women in Brown’s new Britain re-imaginings derives not so much from his unreconstructed habits so much as a natural reluctance to be reminded that his old cabinet (23 men, four women) could almost be a model for later Tory iniquities like Rishi Sunak’s. Either way, another singular aspect of Brown’s report is the section on Lords reform, which, stressing the chamber’s “indefensible” bloat and illegitimacy, overlooks another irrefutable argument for change: that it is 72% male. Partly resulting from the guarantee, so long as male primogeniture remains an element of the legislature, that around one in eight places will go to nonentities who are, in addition to being, by definition, entitled, picked by all-male elections and probably Conservative, not female. The last two such ornaments being respectively an obscure financier, Lord Effingham, and one called Ashcombe, relevant skill: “I have pursued a career in insurance.” Old spiritual habits mean that of the 25 bishops, 20 are men. Additional male dominance being assured via regular honours for donors and redundant ministers. If that bothers Brown, he doesn’t mention it in his vision. Which should be disappointing even for male supporters of Lords reform, since, unlike the defences of its immoderate size (oh please, is now really the time?) or hereditaries (oh please, is now really the time?), structural sex discrimination must be harder to trivialise, even for the most helplessly assimilated peers. By disregarding it, Brown has actually helped Lord Blunkett-minded members to drone on, as they have for ever, about the insurmountable obstacles presented by this, that or the other, all the more so at a time of international/economic/entirely invented difficulty. One distinguished exception is Lord Wakeham, whose report on Lords reform recommended, along with reduction in size and eviction of remaining hereditary peers, a more representative chamber that featured, together with proper representation for minority ethnic groups, “broadly equal numbers of men and women”. He noted: “The House of Lords has for too long contained an excessive proportion of white males.” And, as his proposals went nowhere, it still excessively does. Two decades on, perhaps it’s less amazing that Gordon Brown carried on being Gordon Brown than that Keir Starmer and his fellow enthusiasts for political transformation are content for their dream to leave unaddressed the older one of women’s full representation. Still, thank goodness, once again, for Mayor Brabin. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The agreement came after Chinese-brokered talks held in Beijing. “As a result of the talks, Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to resume diplomatic relations and reopen embassies … within two months,” Iran’s state news agency Irna reported, citing a joint statement. Riyadh cut ties with Tehran after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran in 2016 following the Saudi execution of the revered Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. The rivalry between predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia has dominated Middle East politics in recent years, spreading into Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Nour News, which is linked to Iran’s supreme national security council, posted footage of Ali Shamkhani, the council’s secretary, with a Saudi official and China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi. “After implementing the decision, the foreign ministers of both nations will meet to prepare for exchange of ambassadors,” Iranian state television said. The agreement has potentially wide implications for the Iran nuclear deal and the civil war in Yemen, where the two sides are locked in a proxy war, and shows the new determination of Saudi Arabia to conduct a foreign policy independent of the west. The Saudi Press Agency confirmed the agreement, which said the two countries had agreed to respect state sovereignty and not interfere in each other’s internal affairs. The statement also said Riyadh and Tehran had agreed to activate a security cooperation agreement signed in 2001. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said: “The return of normal relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia provides great capacities to the two countries, the region and the Islamic world. The neighbourhood policy, as the key axis of the government’s foreign policy, is strongly moving in the right direction, and the diplomatic apparatus is actively behind the preparation of more regional steps.” Talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran on a potential reconciliation have been continuing for years mainly in Iraq, so it comes as a surprise that the deal was sealed in China. Shamkhani, Iran’s national security secretary, acknowledged the role played by Baghdad, saying he appreciated Iraqi efforts in hosting five rounds of Iran-Saudi Arabia talks and adding that their efforts were valuable in paving the way for the agreement. Saudi sources said it was important that it was China’s plan that will, at least in principle, hold Iran to account. The deal could, however, have implications for a US-led effort to isolate Iran economically through sanctions. If there is a genuine warming of Saudi relations with Tehran, one consequence is likely to be Saudi investment inside Iran. A further potential consequence of the diplomatic re-engagement is that Saudi Arabia may rein back its London-based satellite channel Iran International, which has proved popular inside Iran by siding with the protesters. Speaking in London earlier this week, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, defended Saudi Arabia’s links with China, saying: “China is our largest trading partner. It is also the largest trading partner of most countries. And that is a reality that we will have to deal with. China, for us, is an important and valued partner in many areas. We have excellent working relationships across many sectors. But we have said and repeat this, always, we will look towards our own interests. And we will look for them in the west and in the east.” He also stressed that he believed the Iran nuclear talks in their current form were moribund, and it would be better to change the format so that other currently excluded regional powers most affected by Iran’s nuclear programme were included. Prince Saud added that he did not think the Saudis would have any additional demands about Iran’s civil nuclear programme than those currently posed by the west, but said: “I believe we can, when we are at the table, make it quite clear to the Iranians that this is not just a concern of distant countries, but it’s also a concern of its neighbours. Those neighbours would move into seeking better normal relations. So if we make clear that this is part of reassuring us, I think that may help them find it more acceptable to engage in such a process.” In Yemen, the Saudis have been backing the internationally recognised government in an eight-year civil war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels based in the north, but have been looking for a way to end the war by conducting private talks in Oman with the Houthis. Saudi Arabia will hope that Iran will halt Houthi drone and missile strikes on the kingdom, and that Iran will help with Saudi talks with the Houthis. But officials stressed that expectations would, at least initially, remain low. The pact does not necessarily mean any change in the Saudi approach to the Palestinian conflict, where it has been warning Israel that it is on course to cause dangerous bloodshed. However, the deal will cause concern among many Israeli politicians who have sought global isolation for its arch-enemy Iran. Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli prime minister, described the pact as a “serious and dangerous” development and a “fatal blow to the effort to create a regional alliance” against the Islamic Republic. Saudi Arabia has refused to join the Abraham accords that normalised relations between Israel and some Arab states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/dec/13/does-a-kettle-use-more-electricity-than-a-tv-power-use","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Does a kettle use more electricity than a TV?

Is it really cheaper to use the microwave to cook your food, as has been suggested? With the cost of electricity putting the squeeze on all our finances, and a house full of tech, I decided it was time to see how power-hungry everyday devices really are. We are constantly told that all manner of appliances chew through electricity, and that you can make huge savings by switching off “vampire devices” at the wall. But is that really true? To cut through the fug and find out myself, I grabbed a power meter and spent the last two months testing everything I could. Some devices get a bad rap for a good reason, guzzling electricity like nobody’s business. Some older wifi routers will fall into that category, and my testing suggests you may also be paying more than you think to watch TV. I was also surprised at how much it cost to use our hairdryer. However, I found that other devices were reassuringly frugal. Some manufacturers provide electricity consumption figures for their products. Others print the maximum amount of power a device can use in watts (W) on its plug. Measuring the amount of electricity used yourself with a simple power meter is easy. They cost under £20, slot in between your device and the power socket and can typically measure from 0.5W and up. You may be surprised by what you find. To convert watts into kilowatt-hours (kWh), the energy unit in which consumption is measured, simply divide by 1,000 and multiply by the number of hours in use. Here’s the good, the bad and the ugly from my research. The good According to my testing, a lot of the technology made in the last five years was fairly energy efficient, drawing less than 0.5W in standby mode, so would cost a maximum of £1.50 if left plugged in all the time for a year, but likely far, far less. That included the TV, monitor, smart kettle, smart bulbs, Xbox games console, smart hubs for the lights and thermostat, and many other devices, including various phone, tablet and laptop chargers. However, one standout was my 10-year-old Panasonic microwave, which consumed 2W when not doing anything other than displaying the time – a £6-a-year charge I could do without. Wirelessly connected systems typically consumed a little more. Sonos speakers, which connect via wifi to each other and the internet, drew between 1W and 3W (£3-£9 a year) when on standby, depending on age. Smart speakers were pleasingly energy efficient. Amazon’s Echo Dot with Clock and Google’s Nest Mini consumed less than 0.5W when idle and only 2.3-4W (less than 0.13p an hour) when pumping out music at maximum volume. LED smart bulbs were also fairly efficient, consuming about 6W (0.17p an hour) when turned up to maximum brightness, which is roughly the same as their non-smart equivalents. Charging portable electronics is generally low-cost. Smartphones typically cost less than 1p a full charge, while an iPad Air costs about 1.4p, and a laptop, such as the 14in MacBook Pro, costs 3.4p to fully power back up. A Philips electric toothbrush costs less than 3p in electricity to use a year. Modern set-top boxes also consume very little power. The latest Apple TV 4K and Sky’s new Stream box draw less than 0.5W in standby and cost 0.07p and 0.14p an hour respectively while watching movies. Older boxes, such as Sky Q, consume about 12W (0.4p an hour) when watching TV but go into a deep sleep overnight, drawing less than 0.5W when not recording or updating. The bad Generally speaking, if a device has a screen or emits light, it consumes more electricity. Google’s 7in Nest Hub draws about 2.7W (0.09p an hour) when displaying photos, costing roughly 1.5p a day to keep plugged in. Amazon’s bigger Echo Show 10 costs just under 4p a day to run. My 28in 4K Asus computer monitor costs just over 1p an hour to use. However, my TV produced one of the biggest surprises. My mid-range 55in LG OLED TV costs 2.2p an hour to watch for HD content. Start watching HDR content or gaming, however, and the cost increases to about 3.3p an hour. The Xbox consumes about 6p an hour when gaming, which with the TV costs less than 10p an hour – far less than a gaming PC would cost. However, using a console such as an Xbox for streaming TV costs about 2p an hour, which could quickly add up. Another surprise might be just how much electricity your wifi router consumes. Some older models can consume as much as 18W (£53 a year). The more modern Linksys Velop MX5300 that I use draws about 10W, costing £29.78 a year in electricity per unit, of which I have four dotted around my house. Turning off the internet to save electricity probably isn’t realistic but asking your provider for the latest, more efficient model may save you some money. The ugly Anything that heats or moves consumed the most power in my testing, which is almost all domestic appliances. Cooking is expensive regardless of what you do but the oven is one of the priciest. An electric fan oven at 200C costs about 45-55p an hour to run. My 850W microwave costs about 40p an hour to run but cooks food significantly quicker. However, a gas hob can still be cheaper to use. Heating 800g of lentil soup in 10 minutes on the smallest ring cost 0.14p compared with about 2p in the microwave. Even tea and toast quickly adds up. My Morphy Richards two-slot toaster costs about 1p a toasting, while boiling 0.5L of room-temperature water costs about 2p. However, I can save about 30% of the electricity by heating the water to only 85C for coffee using a smart kettle. Doing the washing is fairly costly, too. A 72-minute 40C daily wash cycle in a 7kg Samsung washing machine costs 25p in electricity but significantly more at higher temperatures or longer cycles with more spins. One surprisingly expensive item was the hairdryer. A Parlux 2200W dryer costs about 6p to use for 10 minutes. Electric heaters are also expensive to run. Even a relatively efficient Dyson fan heater costs 16p an hour to keep a small room at 20C when the ambient temperature is 14C, which is about 5p more than the amount of gas burned an hour by my 2013 combi boiler heating the whole house under similar conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-battle-kherson-kyiv","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T18:04:06Z","webTitle":"Putin watches Russian nuclear drills; 1,000 bodies exhumed in Kharkiv oblast, reports say – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-battle-kherson-kyiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-battle-kherson-kyiv","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a summary of the day’s headlines: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, monitored drills of the country’s strategic nuclear forces involving multiple practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles on Wednesday. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, reported to Putin that the exercise was intended to simulate a “massive nuclear strike” by Russia in retaliation for a nuclear attack on the country. About 1,000 bodies – including civilians and children – have been exhumed in the recently liberated territories of the Kharkiv oblast, media reports say. This includes the 447 bodies found at the mass burial site in Izium. Ukraine’s counter-offensive against Russian forces in the southern Kherson region is proving more difficult than it was in the northeast because of wet weather and the terrain, Ukraine’s defence minister said. Kyiv’s forces are piling pressure on Russian troops in the strategically important Kherson region occupied by Moscow since the start of its invasion, threatening president Vladimir Putin with another big battlefield setback, Reuters reported. The United Nations’ aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said on Wednesday that he was “relatively optimistic” that a UN-brokered deal that allowed Ukraine Black Sea grain exports would be extended beyond mid-November. Griffiths travelled to Moscow with senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan earlier this month for discussions with Russian officials on the deal, which also aims to facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertiliser to global markets. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Wednesday he did not believe Russia’s president Vladimir Putin would use nuclear weapons. Putin has warned repeatedly that Russia has the right to defend itself using any weapons in its arsenal, which includes the world’s largest nuclear stockpile. About 70,000 civilians have been relocated from the right bank of the Dnipro river to the left bank in the Kherson oblast, the Russian-appointed governor of the region told Russian media. Ukraine’s government is advising refugees living abroad not to return until the spring amid mounting fears over whether the country’s damaged energy infrastructure can cope with demand this winter. The energy crisis comes as officials in Kyiv warned that the coming winter may herald the heaviest fighting of the war, around the southern city of Kherson where Russian forces have been digging in. Up to 70 Australian defence force personnel will be deployed to the UK to train Ukrainian troops in the latest increase in the country’s support for Kyiv. The Australian government announced the decision late on Wednesday while emphasising that the ADF members would not be entering Ukrainian territory. The Kremlin also said assets in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed it had annexed last month may in future be transferred to Russian companies. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was obvious that “abandoned assets” could not be left inactive, and the government would deal with the issue. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, held a phone call with his Indian and Chinese counterparts and raised Russia’s concerns about the possible use of a “dirty bomb” by Ukraine, Shoigu’s ministry said. It followed a series of calls Shoigu has held since Sunday on the same topic with Nato defence ministers. The only way to facilitate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is helping Kyiv to defend itself militarily, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, told parliament. “Peace can be achieved by supporting Ukraine ... it is the only chance we have for the two sides to negotiate,” Meloni told the Senate ahead of a confidence vote on her newly appointed rightist government. EU regulators are considering extending easier state-aid rules that allow governments to support businesses affected by the war in Ukraine to the end of 2023, and with bigger amounts permitted, the competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said. The more flexible rules were introduced in March and subsequently revised in July. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, monitored drills of the country’s strategic nuclear forces involving multiple practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles on Wednesday. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin that the exercise was intended to simulate a “massive nuclear strike” by Russia in retaliation for a nuclear attack on the country, the Associated Press reported. It followed Putin’s warning about his readiness to use “all means available” to fend off attacks on Russia’s territory in a clear reference to the country’s nuclear arsenals. During the Russian drills, a Yars land-based intercontinental ballistic missile was test-fired from the northern Plesetsk launch site. A Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea also launched a Sineva ICBM at the Kura firing range on the far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, and Tu-95 strategic fired cruise missiles at practice targets. The Kremlin said in a statement that all tasks set for the exercise were fulfilled and all the missiles that were test-fired reached their designated targets. The only way to facilitate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is helping Kyiv to defend itself militarily, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, told parliament. “Peace can be achieved by supporting Ukraine ... it is the only chance we have for the two sides to negotiate,” Meloni told the Senate ahead of a confidence vote on her newly appointed rightist government. Meloni has repeatedly pledged support to Kyiv, while her coalition allies Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini have been much more ambivalent on the issue due to their historic ties with Putin, Reuters reported. Meloni said that while the arms Italy supplies to Ukraine are not decisive for the outcome of the war, they are vital for Italy to maintain its international credibility. EU regulators are considering extending easier state-aid rules that allow governments to support businesses affected by the war in Ukraine to the end of 2023, and with bigger amounts permitted, competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. The more flexible rules were introduced in March and subsequently revised in July. The European Commission is seeking feedback from EU countries on the level of public guarantees they can provide to energy companies to cover the financial collateral for their trading activities in order to offset high market prices and volatility. Governments are also asked how the rules can be made more flexible to allow them to provide faster and more effective support to companies hit with high energy bills. “One of the things we are consulting on is a prolongation for a full year until 31 December 2023. We are also consulting on larger aid amounts,” Vestager told a European Parliament hearing. She said the commission has to date given the green light to several billion euros of state aid. “Based on the rules we have already, we have taken 114 decisions that is as of 17 October and we have been approving 133 national measures notified by 25 member states. The budgets that we have been approving are around €455bn,” Vestager said. She said the commission may broaden the scope of the kind of businesses eligible for state aid. The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on individuals and entities involved in what it described as Russia’s malign influence operations in Moldova as well as systemic corruption in the small eastern European country. The people who have had sanctions placed on them, a mix of Russian and Moldovan officials, include oligarchs “widely recognised for capturing and corrupting Moldova’s political and economic institutions and those acting as instruments of Russia’s global influence campaign”, the US Treasury Department said in a statement. The designations also include former Moldovan parliament member Vladimir Plahotniuc, who has manipulated “key sectors of Moldova’s government, including the law enforcement, electoral and judicial sectors”, the statement said. There was no immediate comment from Russia or Moldova, Reuters reported. The United Nations’ aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Wednesday that he was “relatively optimistic” that a UN-brokered deal that allowed Ukraine Black Sea grain exports would be extended beyond mid-November. Griffiths travelled to Moscow with senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan earlier this month for discussions with Russian officials on the deal, which also aims to facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertiliser to global markets.

Kyiv’s forces are piling pressure on Russian troops in the strategically important Kherson region occupied by Moscow since the start of its invasion, threatening president Vladimir Putin with another big battlefield setback, Reuters reported. “First of all, the south of Ukraine is an agricultural region, and we have a lot of irrigation and water supply channels, and the Russians use them like trenches,” defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov told a news conference. “It’s more convenient for them.” “The second reason is weather conditions. This is the rainy season, and it’s very difficult to use fighting carrier vehicles with wheels,” he said, adding that this reduced the options for Ukraine’s armed forces. “The counter-offensive campaign in the Kherson direction is more difficult than in the Kharkiv direction,” he added. Russia will not use nuclear weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin has said in an interview with CNN. The US network’s chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour tweeted a video previewing an interview with Kelin, which is due to air later today. The ambassador’s comments come on a day when Russia is conducting military nuclear training drills, she adds. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Wednesday he did not believe Russia’s president Vladimir Putin would use nuclear weapons. Putin has warned repeatedly that Russia has the right to defend itself using any weapons in its arsenal, which includes the world’s largest nuclear stockpile. Russia’s setbacks in the war in Ukraine have heightened Western concerns that Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon, Reuters reported. “My personal opinion is that Putin won’t use nukes,” Reznikov told a news briefing when asked about the issue. About 1,000 bodies – including civilians and children – have been exhumed in the recently liberated territories of the Kharkiv oblast, media reports say. This includes the 447 bodies found at the mass burial site in Izium. About 70,000 civilians have been relocated from the right bank of the Dnipro river to the left bank in the Kherson oblast, the Russian-appointed governor of the region told Russian media. With the strategic southern region of the partially Russian-occupied Kherson believed to be the location of the next “heaviest of battles”, Russian authorities have been relocating residents, some just over the Dnipro river, others to southern Russia. The Russian-backed government are calling this an evacuation and say it’s for the civilians’ own safety as the Ukrainian armed forces move closer. Some Ukrainian officials believe the Russians are moving civilians as a way to fake-out Ukrainian forces. But no matter the reason, forcibly moving any citizen in an occupied territory is considered a war crime under the Geneva Convention. The European Union urged the bloc’s defence ministers on Wednesday to coordinate purchases of weapons, to obtain better terms from suppliers as they seek to replenish supplies depleted by shipments to Ukraine. Western countries have been rushing to restock weapons and ammunition after shipping huge quantities to Kyiv, requiring industry to ramp up to meet the surging demand, Reuters reported. “It is urgent to restore the readiness of our European armed forces and replenish depleted stocks,” Stijn Mols, the head of the EU diplomatic service’s security and defence division, told a European Parliament committee. EU defence ministers next meet on 15 November, and Mols said he hoped they would present concrete proposals for coordinated arms purchases. European countries need air and missile defence, anti-tank and artillery systems and drones, Mols said. Brussels hopes for around 5-7 “emblematic projects” to coordinate purchases by member countries in areas such as ammunition. Defence purchases in the EU are rarely carried out jointly, with countries eager to support their domestic industries. Ukraine’s government is advising refugees living abroad not to return until the spring amid mounting fears over whether the country’s damaged energy infrastructure can cope with demand this winter. The energy crisis comes as officials in Kyiv warned that the coming winter may herald the heaviest fighting of the war, around the southern city of Kherson where Russian forces have been digging in. With a third of the country’s energy sector compromised by recent Russian missile and drone attacks Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned: “The networks will not cope.” “You see what Russia is doing. We need to survive the winter,” she added. The warning was delivered after a period in which, polling suggested, more Ukrainians had expressed their desire to return home. Vereshchuk said that although she would like Ukrainians to return in the spring, it was important to refrain from returning for now because “the situation will only get worse. If it is possible, stay abroad for the time being”. With no evidence of a letup in the fighting in the country’s east and south, where Ukraine has made recent gains in Russian-occupied areas, many fear the coming winter could be challenging. Ukrainians have already been asked to be sparing in their use of electricity to balance the country’s struggling electricity grid. Up to 70 Australian defence force personnel will be deployed to the UK to train Ukrainian troops in the latest increase in the country’s support for Kyiv. The Australian government announced the decision late on Wednesday while emphasising that the ADF members would not be entering Ukrainian territory. It also said it would provide Ukraine with 30 more Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles, bringing to 90 the total number promised since Russia’s invasion. The government has been signalling for months that Australia might join other countries in training Ukrainian troops as part of longer term assistance, but has not confirmed the details until now. It says up to 70 ADF members will fly to the UK in January to join Operation Interflex, a mission that also involves personnel from other countries including New Zealand, Canada, Sweden and Finland. Ukrainian troops, including new recruits, have been travelling to the UK for training under this programme. A police officer secures a damaged gas station after a missile strike in Dnipro. The Kremlin also said assets in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed it had annexed last month may in future be transferred to Russian companies. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was obvious that “abandoned assets” could not be left inactive, and the government would deal with the issue. Ukraine, its western allies and an overwhelming majority of countries at the UN general assembly have condemned Russia’s declared annexation of the four regions as illegal, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, held a phone call with his Indian and Chinese counterparts and raised Russia’s concerns about the possible use of a “dirty bomb” by Ukraine, Shoigu’s ministry said. It followed a series of calls Shoigu has held since Sunday on the same topic with Nato defence ministers. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow wanted to prompt an active response from the international community, Reuters reported. India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, reportedly told Shoigu that nuclear weapons should not be used by any side in the war, according to an Indian government statement. “The prospect of the usage of nuclear or radiological weapons goes against the basic tenets of humanity,” Singh told Shoigu while reiterating the need for an early resolution to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected Russia’s allegation that Kyiv is preparing to use a radioactive “dirty bomb” and voiced concern that Moscow is using that as pretext for a further escalation in the war. Over the past day, Russian forces have launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on more than 40 settlements all around Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces. Russian forces have continued their sustained offence on the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas, killing one civilian yesterday in Bakhmut. However, Ukrainian authorities believe that Russian forces are digging in for the “heaviest of battles” in the strategic southern region of Kherson. Russian authorities spent yesterday relocating civilians in the region, blaming the oncoming onslaught of the Ukrainian armed forces for why they had to leave. A Russian missile attack killed two people in Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth-largest city. One of those who died was a pregnant woman. The office of the prosecutor general of Ukraine has launched a pre-trial investigation into the attack. Vladimir Putin entered the invasion of Ukraine with the term “denazification” – now his security council is pivoting to the term “desatanisation”. Aleksey Pavlov, assistant secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, is now claiming there were “hundreds of sects” in Ukraine where citizens have abandoned Orthodox values. Those who live in Ukraine can attest to that statement as being patently false. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 480 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone, bringing the total to 68,900 personnel lost so far in the invasion of Ukraine. The Nobel Foundation has made the decision to not invite the Russian and Belarusian ambassadors to its storied prize ceremony this year, even though the foundation typically extends an invitation to all ambassadors stationed in Sweden. “In view of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the Foundation has chosen not to invite the ambassadors of Russia and Belarus to the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Stockholm,” the foundation said in statement. The foundation jointly awarded this year’s peace prize to the Centre for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights organisation, in conjunction with Memorial, a Russian human rights group outlawed by the Kremlin, and the veteran Belarussian activist Ales Bialiatski, who is being held in prison without trial in his native country. Russia is purportedly recruiting members of Afghanistan’s highly respected national army commando corps to fight in Ukraine, Foreign Policy is reporting. These are the commandos that were trained by US navy seals and British armed forces. About 20,000 to 30,000 of the volunteer commandos were left behind when the US left Afghanistan in Taliban control in August 2021. The office of the prosecutor general of Ukraine has launched a pre-trial investigation into a Russian missile attack on Dnipro that killed two people, the office said in a statement today. One of those killed was a pregnant woman. “As a result of the enemy attack (yesterday), two townspeople were killed, four more wounded were hospitalised,” the statement reads. “A gas station, car wash, tire repair shop, cars were damaged.” With the strategic southern region of the partially Russian-occupied Kherson believed to be the location of the next “heaviest of battles”, Russian authorities spent yesterday relocating residents, some just over the Dnipro river, others to southern Russia. Here’s a video from Kyiv Independent on why calling this an evacuation of civilians is wrong: Mercedes-Benz has become the latest company to leave Russia. Russia is purportedly recruiting members of Afghanistan’s national army commando corps to fight in Ukraine, Foreign Policy is reporting. These are the commandos that were trained by US navy seals and British armed forces. About 20,000 to 30,000 of the volunteer commandos were left behind when the US left Afghanistan in Taliban control in August 2021. According to FP, only a few hundred senior officers were evacuated before the republic collapsed. While thousands escaped to neighbouring countries as the Taliban hunted and executed collaborators with the collapsed government, many more remain in Afghanistan, in hiding. The US spent $90bn building the Afghan national defence and security forces. Oleksandra Matviichuk is the Ukrainian lawyer who heads the Centre for Civil Liberties, a human rights organisation, which this month jointly won the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize in conjunction with Memorial, a Russian human rights group outlawed by the Kremlin, and the veteran Belarussian activist Ales Bialiatski, who is being held in prison without trial in his native country. Matviichuk’s organisation has meticulously documented more than 21,000 examples of war crimes committed by occupying Russian forces since 2014, including many from after the invasion in February. She spoke in depth with the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv on the need to hold Russia accountable for its actions as soon as possible. “Because we have a huge material collected – 21,000 episodes of war crimes – we can be very clear that Russia used war crimes as a method of warfare,” she says – and that Russia has sought to subject Ukraine to a “psychological experiment” through “the immense pain of the civilian population”. Read more here: The Nobel Foundation typically extends an invitation to its storied prize ceremony to ambassadors stationed in Sweden each year. This year, however, the foundation made the decision to exclude the Russian and Belarusian ambassadors, according to a statement issued by the foundation yesterday. “In view of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Foundation has chosen not to invite the ambassadors of Russia and Belarus to the Nobel Prize award ceremony in Stockholm,” the statement reads. This year’s ceremony will take place 10 December. The foundation jointly awarded this year’s peace prize to the Centre for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights organisation, in conjunction with Memorial, a Russian human rights group outlawed by the Kremlin, and the veteran Belarussian activist Ales Bialiatski, who is being held in prison without trial in his native country. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 480 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone. Vladimir Putin justified the invasion of Ukraine with claims of the need to “denazify” the country. Yesterday, Russia’s security council pivoted from “denazification” to “desatanisation”, with Aleksey Pavlov, assistant secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, claiming there were “hundreds of sects” in Ukraine where citizens have abandoned Orthodox values. A quick thread on why the narrative of “desatanisation” is false: Over the past day, Russian forces have launched five rockets, 30 air strikes and more than 100 multiple-launch rocket system attacks on more than 40 settlements all around Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces. “Violating the norms of international humanitarian law, the laws and customs of war, (the enemy) continues to strike critical infrastructure and the homes of the civilian population,” the Ukrainian general staff wrote in its morning update. Russian forces have continued their sustained offence on the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas, killing one civilian yesterday in Bakhmut, Donetsk oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. “Russians will be responsible for all crimes on our land,” Kyrylenko wrote. A Russian missile attack killed two people in Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth-largest city. One of those who died was a pregnant woman. Three people were injured. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Vivian Ho will take you through the news for the next few hours. In case you missed this last night: Russia has stepped up its nuclear propaganda and delivered a letter to the United Nations claiming that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a “dirty bomb” on its territory, an allegation dismissed by Kyiv, western governments and weapons experts as absurd and an attempt at distraction or pretext for Moscow’s own escalation. The letter was addressed to the UN secretary general and the Gabonese ambassador, who holds the rotating presidency of the security council, and follows calls by Russia’s defence minister to foreign ministers in recent days making similar unfounded allegations. At the same time, Russia circulated a 310-page document in the security council, repeating earlier debunked claims that Ukraine and its western backers had been working on a bioweapon. Sluggish US wheat exports and competitive prices for Russian and Ukrainian supplies have loomed over wheat markets, Reuters reports, offsetting worries that a United Nations-backed shipping corridor from Ukraine may not be extended beyond November. Ukraine‘s exports of agricultural products could rise more than 8% in October from last month, the Ukrainian Agrarian Council said on Tuesday. Ukraine is keeping its forecast of the winter wheat sowing area for the 2023 harvest unchanged at 3.8m hectares despite a delay caused by unfavourable weather, deputy agriculture minister Taras Vysotskiy told Reuters on Tuesday. Oleksandra Matviichuk has a point she wants to make. The Ukrainian lawyer heads the Centre for Civil Liberties, a human rights organisation that this month jointly won the Nobel peace prize. And she wants to use her platform to call for international action against Russian human rights violations now. The body she heads has patiently documented more than 21,000 examples of war crimes committed by occupying Russian forces since 2014, including many from after the invasion in February. But, speaking quietly and with controlled emotion, she complains: “I haven’t any legal instrument to stop the Russian atrocities” – no immediate way of bringing perpetrators to court. The criminality appears vast when listed. “After the large-scale invasion, we every day documented different kinds of war crimes, like intentional shelling of residential buildings, churches, hospitals, schools, the shelling of evacuation corridors,” Matviichuk says. “We received requests for help from people in the occupied territories because they were abducted, tortured; we recorded sexual violence, extrajudicial killings.” Staff from the Centre for Civil Liberties were among those who travelled through Irpin, Bucha and towns and villages north-west of Kyiv after Russia abandoned its attempt to seize the city in March. “I will remind you,” she says, that bodies were found lying uncollected in the streets, or dumped in mass graves. “And what was Putin’s response? He provided medals to the army unit that was staying in Bucha.” Russia, as governed now, shows a “genocidal character,” she argues. At first she admits the sheer emotional difficulty of taking in the trauma of individual cases, particularly understandable when her organisation deals with so many: The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest update that there have been at least six incidences of sabotage against Russian railway infrastructure since June, with the latest occurring days ago when “an explosive device had damaged the railway near the village of Novozybkovo, approximately 15km from the Russia-Belarus border.” “The line is the main rail link between Russia and southern Belarus,” the Ministry said. The Russian anti-war group ‘Stop the Wagons’ claimed responsibility for the attack on the main line between Russia and southern Belarus. “This is part of a wider trend of dissident attacks against railways in both Russian and Belarus. The Russian authorities have previously clamped down on STW’s online presence,” it said. “The Russian leadership will be increasingly concerned that even a small group of citizens has been sufficiently opposed to the conflict to resort to physical sabotage.” The US president, Joe Biden, and Britain’s new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, agreed during talks on Tuesday to work together to support Ukraine and stand up to China, the White House said. They spoke for the first time a few hours after Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year, inheriting an economic crisis after the resignation of Liz Truss whose tenure lasted 49 days. Only in recent days has Biden appeared to publicly criticise Truss’s doomed economic strategy, in a rare intervention by the US president. Relations between the two countries have also been somewhat strained in recent years amid ongoing tensions over post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland. The White House holds concerns over the impact on peace in the region. Biden and Sunak reaffirmed the “special relationship” between the US and Britain, and said they would work together to advance global security and prosperity, the White House said in a summary of the conversation. “The leaders agreed on the importance of working together to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for its aggression,” the statement said of the war triggered by the Russian invasion: In Mykolaiv region north and west of Kherson city, artillery duels continued throughout Tuesday, according to a post from the frontline on Rybar, a pro-Russian channel on Telegram. In Ishchenka district north of Kherson, Ukrainian forces tried to consolidate their positions, but were forced back to earlier lines, the post said. It said the Ukrainian military was preparing for an advance along the entire length of the frontline. A Reuters reporter in a remote hamlet near part of the Kherson frontline said residents hoped Russian forces would soon withdraw. “You fall asleep at night and you don’t know if you will wake up,” said Mikola Nizinets, 39, referring to Russian shelling. With no power or gas and little food or potable water in the area, many residents have fled, abandoning cattle to roam among expended munitions poking from the soil. Russian forces are digging in for the “heaviest of battles” in the strategic southern region of Kherson, a senior Ukrainian official said, as the Kremlin prepares to defend the largest city under its control from Ukraine‘s counter-offensive. Russian forces in the region have been driven back in recent weeks and risk being trapped against the west bank of the Dnipro river, where the provincial capital of Kherson has been in Russian hands since the early days of the invasion of Ukraine eight months ago. Russian-installed authorities are evacuating residents to the east bank, but Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there was no sign that Russian forces were preparing to abandon the city. “With Kherson everything is clear. The Russians are replenishing, strengthening their grouping there,” Arestovych said in an online video late on Tuesday. “It means that nobody is preparing to withdraw. On the contrary, the heaviest of battles is going to take place for Kherson.” Of the four provinces Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed to have annexed in September, Kherson is arguably the most strategically important. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014 and the mouth of the Dnipro, the vast river that bisects Ukraine. Yuri Sobolevsky, a member of the ousted pro-Ukrainian Kherson regional council, said the Russia-installed authorities were putting increasing pressure on Kherson residents to leave. “Search and filtration procedures are intensifying as are searches of cars and homes,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest for the next while. Russian forces are digging in for the “heaviest of battles” in the strategic southern region of Kherson, a senior Ukrainian official said late on Tuesday, as the Kremlin prepares to defend the largest city under its control from Ukraine’s counter-offensive.

In the meantime, here is the summary of recent news: Donetsk oblast was hit hard in the past day, with at least 15 Russian strikes killing seven civilians and injuring three more. The Ukrainian national police said the strikes also destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. Further south, a car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTV in Russian-occupied Melitopol injured at least five people, including company employees, authorities said. While investigators were still looking into the blast, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official, reportedly told Russian state media the explosion came from an “improvised explosive device”. Russia took its claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory to the UN security council, an assertion dismissed by western and Ukrainian officials as misinformation and a pretext for intensifying the war. Ukraine’s foreign minister said inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog would soon inspect two Ukrainian sites at Kyiv’s request, adding that it feared Moscow’s “dirty bomb” allegations were preparation for a “false-flag” operation. The US congressional Progressive Caucus withdrew a letter to the White House urging a negotiated settlement with Russia, its chair, Pramila Jayapal, confirmed. Vladimir Putin said Russia needed to speed up decision-making in the military campaign in Ukraine. Moscow was generally supportive of the idea of creating a secure zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna, told the Tass news agency. Russia has notified the US of plans to carry out annual exercises of its nuclear forces, the US government said, adding that it lowered the risk of miscalculation at a time of “reckless” Russian nuclear rhetoric. Britain’s incoming prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised Zelenskiy that the UK’s support for Ukraine would be steadfast and “as strong as ever” under his premiership. A Russian court dismissed WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner’s appeal against a nine-year sentence for possessing and smuggling vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. Griner’s lawyer said she hoped she could be released in a prisoner exchange with the US. The US is considering sending older Hawk air defence equipment from storage to Ukraine, two US officials told Reuters. Zelenskiy and the European hosts of a donor conference laid out a vision of a future Ukraine as a European Union member and major exporter of green energy to the continent. The European Commission urged EU countries and companies to donate more money and equipment to support the energy sector in Ukraine, over a third of which has been destroyed by Russian missile and drone strikes. Ukraine’s external financing needs will be around $3bn a month through 2023 in a best case scenario, but could rise as high as $5bn, said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said Russian assets and those of Russian oligarchs amount to a “huge pot of gold” that should be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “We must make sure that the offender pays for reconstruction. Russia should pay Ukraine war damages, war reparations.” Police rescued an eight-year-old boy whose parents were killed in Russian shell strikes in Bakhmut, it was reported. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the boy’s mother was seven months pregnant when she died “in the street” along with his father. Refugees who fled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should stay abroad this winter due to blackouts created by Moscow’s bombardment of energy infrastructure, a Ukrainian minister has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T06:35:19Z","webTitle":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","fields":{"bodyText":"When proposals for the largest solar plant ever conceived for US soil started to gather pace – a plan that involves spearing several million solar panels into the flat farmland of northern Indiana – something in Connie Ehrlich seems to have snapped. Ehrlich, 63, is part of a longstanding farming family in Pulaski county, the site of the new solar project, but doesn’t live in the county and previously only rarely dabbled in its usually somnolent local politics. She has carved out a comfortable life in a sprawling mansion set on 10 acres (four hectares) of land, just outside the city of Lafayette, and is known locally for her donations to medical research and her small fleet of deluxe cars with personalized license plates. But to Ehrlich the idea of transferring 13,000 acres of prized farmland to solar energy production seems to have been so unthinkable that it demanded an extraordinary response. Within months of the project being proposed she had mobilized her wealth to fund a flurry of lawsuits, spearheaded a sometimes-vituperative pressure group and spent $3m buying new plots of land, including a cemetery, on the fringes of the project. Ehrlich even acquired an office nextdoor to the solar developer’s own premises – and in its window a cartoon has been placed showing Joe Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers, depicted as pigs in a sty. The solar farm, which could have its goal of completion next year delayed because of the lawsuits, has stirred up strong feelings among some in Pulaski. “It’s got nasty, really nasty,” said Derrick Stalbaum, a hog farmer who also acts as president of the county’s board of zoning appeals. “It’s surprising as we live in a quiet area with a huge sense of community usually.” The opponents of the solar project, a $1.5bn venture appropriately called Mammoth that is set to span an area almost as large as Manhattan, say they are defying an egregious assault on time-honored farming traditions and are standing up to a newcomer that threatens to warp their pastoral way of life with Chinese-made technology. “We need to protect America’s farmland,” Ehrlich wrote in a February post for the Pulaski County Against Solar group’s Facebook page. “Not only from being sacrificed for the inefficient, unreliable energy generation, but from foreigners’ interest!” The ongoing fight is a sobering reminder of how Biden’s ambitions for a mass transition to renewables, aimed at averting the worst ravages of the climate crisis, will in significant part be decided by the vagaries and veto points of thousands of local officials, county boards and Connie Ehrlich-style opposition across the US. Localized battles over new solar projects threaten to proliferate as the industry, buoyed up by the huge tax credits available for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act, seeks to expand. Over the past year, solar projects in Ohio, Kentucky and Nevada have all been delayed or sunk by irked local people. Ordinances restricting solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities have been passed in 31 states. The prospect of solar energy projects occupying a chunk of American land has stirred unease among farmers, and even among some environmentalists, that valuable forests, wetlands and fertile soils may be sacrificed. If the US really is to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050, researchers at Princeton University have estimated that solar production could have to grow more than 20-fold, occupying an area that, put together, would be equivalent to the size of West Virginia. “We are absolutely seeing local opposition to solar arrays across the US,” said Samantha Levy, climate policy manager at American Farmland Trust. “About half of solar development is going on the best, most productive farmland and that is causing some concern because it’s not like we are making more land. We need to have a smart solar buildout and not hollow out these farming communities.” But for developers, the challenges posed by opponents such as Ehrlich are infuriating. “It’s just throw spaghetti and see what sticks,” said Nick Cohen, chief executive of Doral Renewables, the Israeli-founded developer behind the Mammoth project in Indiana. “It only takes one person to file a lawsuit and this feels like a one-person crusade to burn down the town.” Cohen said his dealings with Ehrlich have been “civil but direct” and that Doral holds out hope of being an amiable neighbor to its foe. The project won’t fell trees or disturb any fragile ecosystem, he pointed out. “If people have real concerns we can work it out,” Cohen said. “But the conduct here is so irrational and perplexing. Connie and [a] small group of followers are working against the best interests of the entire community.” The episode is also a demonstration of how an era of toxic politics and vicious online vitriol can quickly sour a community like Pulaski. Some people have left their church because of arguments with other congregants over the solar plant, while even family members have been at odds with one another. Stalbaum, the head of the board of zoning appeals, said while most people in the county are either supportive or apathetic about Mammoth, a faction of people are so outraged they have taken to following and videoing him and other members of the board, or idling in cars outside their homes. Anonymous phone calls, meanwhile, were made to a school where Stalbaum was previously a teacher to cryptically warn that he was not suited to be around children, he said. On Facebook, supporters of the project have been called “roaches” and “traitors” and, in one instance, seemingly compared to Adolf Hitler. “I can only imagine how intimidating he is around children!!” one poster wrote about Stalbaum. “This is no longer really about the solar applications; it’s more about driving the community apart,” said Stalbaum. “I have been attacked pretty hard for this, simply because this project meets our county requirements.” Much of the debate in Pulaski county about solar has become entangled in national resentments, with several unprompted attacks on Biden in public hearings for supposedly forcing through the Green New Deal, or for allowing Mexican immigrants to somehow take precious farmland along with the solar developers. In Pulaski, a county where Donald Trump outperformed Biden four to one in the 2020 election, flags hanging outside homes declaring “Let’s Go Brandon” and, less euphemistically, “Fuck Biden” are commonplace. *** Pulaski county appears to be an otherwise unassuming location for what will be one of the largest solar projects in the world. A rectangular slice of agricultural northern Indiana, Pulaski is home to about 12,000 people, a number that is declining, and a lot of corn. Peppermint is grown here, too, and sold to the Wrigley Company for gum flavoring. A ripple of excitement was felt in nearby Fulton county in 1978 when the partial skeleton of a hulking mastodon was discovered in a drainage ditch, exquisitely preserved in peat. It was this 10,000-year-old specimen that would give the Mammoth project its name, although Doral was more excited by quirks of infrastructure and geology – the area has flat, sandy ground ideal for solar and is a meeting point for two vast electrical grids, called MISO and PJM, that service tens of millions of Americans and will allow Mammoth to dump converted sunlight into both of them for consumption. In July 2019, Cohen was introduced to a farmer named Norm Welker. Welker’s land, Cohen said, was “right on the bullseye, exactly where you’d want to be.” Transmission lines run through Welker’s fields in Starke county and, crucially, Welker himself has been unsentimental about turning away from half a century of planting and harvesting corn on this land. “You couldn’t dream of a better project for us,” said Welker, a 62-year-old who has a short, clipped moustache and is almost more enthused by the idea of solar than the developers themselves. The money helps, of course – Welker’s 1,075 acres in Starke county will be leased for the next three decades at $1,000 an acre a year. “It’s five times what I’d make through corn,” he said. “It’s crazy money.” Construction began on Welker’s land earlier this year and a grid-like pattern of pilings driven into the soil is already in place. Long steel tubes are placed horizontally upon the pilings, with brackets on top to affix the solar panels, which are awaiting clearance for import from Malaysia. Wiring dangles from some of these poles, and cables lie in partly dug trenches, ready to connect the output to an inverter which will then help propel electrons into the grid. The panels will automatically rotate east to west, chasing the sun throughout the day, shaking off snow in the winter. But the whole system is fairly simple to slot together and is shorter than the serried ears of corn Welker would normally grow here. “It’s so passive, I mean, it’s even more benign than wind,” said Kevin Parzyck, a senior project manager for Doral. A few years ago, officials in Pulaski rejected an application to build wind turbines in the county. “With wind you’re actually spinning a generator,” Parzyck said. “The crickets make more noise than these solar panels do.” To Welker, solar is an evolution of farming rather than a betrayal of it. He already harvests the sunlight for his crops, he reasons, and considers fears of food shortages by taking land out of production overblown given that 40% of all US corn is already mashed up for another form of energy – ethanol, which is added to gasoline. Farmers are also routinely paid by the federal government to keep tracts of land free from crops, in order to bolster the price of corn. The rows of nodding metal and glass will contrast with the surrounding fields of corn, but it’s a moot point as to whether they are more unnatural or harmful to the surrounds. Wild grasses and wildflowers are springing up around the metal pilings, bringing back insect life to a landscape that is typically bombarded by pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. America’s corn belt, which stretches from Indiana to Nebraska, produces a fifth of the world’s maize, a stunning feat of agricultural might that has deforested large areas, stripped away topsoil and made the land, by one measure, 48 times more toxic than it was 25 years ago. “I’m gonna retire, I’m gonna restore habitats – it’s likely there’ll never be a cornfield here ever again,” said Welker. He has a further 500 acres in Pulaski county he hopes to give over to solar, too, but there he faces the tenacious obstacle of Ehrlich, whom he knew as a neighbor when she went to community college in Indianapolis and then married Donald “Jerry” Ehrlich, founder of the Wabash trucking company. Now the relationship is somewhat strained. “It blows my mind! It’s my farm – why do I need my neighbor’s permission to do this?” Welker asked, suddenly enraged. “I’m not doing any harm to you. What’s the deal with this woman? These people are nitwits.” The Guardian made multiple requests to Ehrlich and her lawyer for comment. There was no response to these requests. The Mammoth project – which will generate 1.3 gigawatts of renewable energy, enough to power more than 200,000 households annually in coal-dependent Indiana – is split into three distinct areas encompassing dozens of landowners, which looks on a map like a collection of Jenga blocks scattered on to the landscape. Two of these areas are in Pulaski, which has a county ordinance that requires special hearings to consider changing the use of land for solar. This opportunity to stymie the project was seized upon by Ehrlich and her group. The first hearing – by the county’s board of zoning appeals, a five-member body that issues typically mundane decisions about land use – in July 2020 was eagerly anticipated. Outside, people livestreamed proceedings via their phones and speakers were set up so the overflow crowd could listen in. Inside, Stalbaum tried to maintain a sense of order. A procession of local residents stepped up to speak at the microphone, the supporters of solar stressing it would help sustain farms for future generations and raise vital tax revenue for ailing public services. Opponents, meanwhile, were more pointed, often invoking a divine plan for this land and taking aim at local officials who would stray from this. “I don’t want my back yard to be a guinea pig!” exclaimed Riley Cervenka Tiede, Ehrlich’s niece, a recording of the meeting shows. “As a farmer I take great pride in the beautiful land that God has blessed us with and believe it should stay to be used to grow crops.” Tiede warned that property values would decline if solar arrived – there is somewhat threadbare evidence of this – and raised the spectre of a disastrous fire. On the Facebook streamed comments, people pondered if birds and plants would be fried by the glare from the panels, perhaps in response to a different, and unusual, type of solar farm in California that caused some birds to spontaneously combust after flying into its beams of concentrated sunlight. “Firefighters, police, please stand up,” Tiede implored, as applause thundered for the first responders. “Their lives are more important than a few landowners getting money!” When Nathan Origer, head of community development for Pulaski, attempted to explain that revenue from Mammoth could be used to help lower taxes for landowners – Mammoth will plow about $1.5m a year into Pulaski’s coffers, about a fifth of the county’s revenues from income tax – a man off camera shouted, “You’re full of shit!” Mark Cervenka, Ehrlich’s brother who farms land in Pulaski, said locals had been ambushed by a “disturbing, frightening and disgusting” solar plan. “I’m a farmer and always will be. I believe the land should be used the way God intended it to be,” he added. Things get so heated at one point a woman stormed toward the board members and started shouting indecipherably at them while holding up her phone. Stalbaum asked two burly sheriff’s deputies to remove her and muttered, “You’re not helping your cause here.” The board voted unanimously to allow a special exception for the solar project in the wake of the gathering, although with conditions, pushed for by Ehrlich and allied local resident Jennifer Knebel, that new trees will block the sight of the solar panels, noise will be kept to a minimum and wide buffer areas of open land will be kept at the project boundaries. Just 20% of the project area will be covered by the actual solar panels, which are disparagingly called a “sea of black glass” by opponents. Ehrlich has not been sated by this partial victory. According to Knebel, the group has spent “hundreds of hours” pondering the issue, usually coming to hearings with reams of notes to read out. Doral has had to muster a cadre of experts to counter claims the silicon and aluminum panels will give off deadly radiation, or that they will kill sandhill cranes by blinding them or will leach poison into the soil. “I feel like they got just about everything they could get apart from outright banning solar,” said Origer. “But whatever everyone did, it wasn’t enough. I have to conclude that it is at least partially an ideological thing. Ms Ehrlich simply doesn’t think that solar is good.” In a flurry of online posts, op-eds and speeches, Ehrlich has claimed solar developers “prey upon financially struggling counties”, questioned the efficacy of renewable energy and complained that the energy generated won’t be used by the county itself, a striking protest given Pulaski farmers’ routine sale of corn to be consumed across the US. “How can some landowners believe they have the right to do whatever they want with their land while destroying someone else’s property and quality of life?” Ehrlich posted in July last year on her group’s Facebook page. Public records show that Ehrlich has spent about $3m to buy three plots of land in Pulaski since 2020, including a cemetery near the town of Francesville. Some of the land is within a mile of the planned Mammoth project. Meanwhile, Ehrlich and eight other complainants have filed lawsuits to try to overturn the approval of the land use, dispute a tax abatement given to Doral and stop the county’s subsequent move to make it easier for developers to set up in Pulaski county. In September, Ehrlich got some reward for her efforts – the Indiana court of appeals ruled that Mammoth had not submitted a complete application for the project’s zoning. The state supreme court may now be called upon for further judgment, although the developers do not expect to be halted by what they frame as an administrative redo. “It doesn’t make much sense to me that she would purchase land for very high prices in the neighborhood if she thinks property prices will go down because of the project,” said Cohen. “She hasn’t been willing to compromise to discuss a mutual solution. All of the millions of dollars we are spending on lawsuits, that could’ve been put into the community. There’s nothing I would like more than to have them as our friends.” A detente doesn’t appear likely, however, if you take a trip to Doral’s project headquarters in Winamac, a small town that is Pulaski’s county seat. On the main road into Winamac is a huge billboard that reads “No to industrial solar” and, once you get to the Doral office, the opposition is hard for the developers to ignore. Ehrlich spent $100,000 on a former cigar store, public records show, that is a footstep from Doral’s own office. The windows are plastered with anti-solar posters, including the cartoon of Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers depicted as pigs. “Protesting – that’s Connie’s job,” said Welker, as he looked at the strange juxtaposition of the two offices. “Nick and I stopped in one time and tried to have peace talks, but she’s just, ‘No. I’m here to save Pulaski county from solar panels.’ That’s her job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/apr/29/wholesale-power-prices-double-in-a-year-in-australias-main-electricity-market","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-28T17:30:20Z","webTitle":"Australia’s wholesale power prices double in a year as coal-fired power plants falter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/wholesale-power-prices-double-in-a-year-in-australias-main-electricity-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/wholesale-power-prices-double-in-a-year-in-australias-main-electricity-market","fields":{"bodyText":"Wholesale power prices in Australia’s main electricity market continued to rise in the first three months of 2022, more than doubling the cost a year earlier, with the increase blamed mostly on more costly fossil fuels and the falling reliability of coal-fired power plants. Renewable energy, meanwhile, grew its share of the market to more than one-third, pushing carbon emissions from the largest polluting sector to new lows, according to the quarterly energy dynamics report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). Wholesale electricity prices averaged $87 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the first three months of 2022, up 141% from a year earlier, and two-thirds higher than the final three months of 2021. By the end of the March quarter, the average price in the four eastern mainland states was $94/MWh, up from an average of $65/MWh at the end of 2021. On Thursday, future prices for this quarter topped $200/MWh for both Queensland and New South Wales, indicating the jolt in costs is continuing. For the March quarter, generation at black coal plants in NSW and Queensland fell an average 456MW. Availability was off 3% to its lowest March quarter level since at least 2002. The unavailability of those ailing units – along with higher demand particularly during heatwaves in Queensland – triggered a divide with those states facing “significantly” higher prices than Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, Aemo said. “Coinciding with unplanned coal generation outages, Queensland experienced significant episodes of high demand, with overall price volatility contributing $47/MWh of the region’s average Q1 price of $150/MWh, its second highest for any quarter since 1998,” said Violette Mouchaileh, an Aemo executive. The leap in wholesale power prices is beginning to feed into the bills sent to households and businesses. Extra costs will also stoke the highest consumer price inflation since the introduction of the GST more than 20 years ago. The higher power prices may also feature in the federal election campaign, with Coalition leaders such as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, repeating claims on Thursday that the government had lowered power prices while they had risen under previous Labor governments. “The government is delivering on its commitment to secure affordable and reliable energy supply and has achieved its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MWh,” the government stated in its budget just last month. Labor, meanwhile, has argued its plan to accelerate the construction of transmission and other infrastructure would bring in more renewables and force down power prices. Consumers would pick up higher equipment costs but such a transformation is necessary as ageing, costly fossil-fuel plants aren’t likely to be replaced by similar kit. Aemo said wholesale prices were already averaging almost a quarter more than that federal budget figure, with market bids by coal plants leading the increase as costs for the fuel increased. “Compared to the first quarter of 2021, over 3,000MW of black coal offers shifted from lower-price bands to above $60/MWh – the largest year-on-year quarterly change since 1998,” Mouchaileh said. The shift had started before the surge in global coal prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she added.

Prices were at near-record levels across all Aemo markets, averaging $9.93 per gigajoule, compared with an average $6.05/GJ in the March quarter of 2021. Record gas prices were set in Victoria, Brisbane and Adelaide, while Sydney posted its second-highest March quarter level. Renewable energy sources continued to grab a bigger share of the market, with both capacity and output increasing. Wind and grid-scale solar output increased 743MW to a quarterly record of 4,190MW. Small-scale solar, mostly on rooftops, added another 460MW of capacity. Total renewable share reached 33.7% of supply. With the near-zero cost of fuel for wind, solar and hydro, the expansion of those sources left 6.6% of all dispatch intervals across the national electricity market at negative or zero spot prices. While a record, it was smaller than the share of such pricing in the December half of 2021. “Southern states continued to see higher incidences [of zero or negative prices] at 16.4% for South Australia and 12.5% for Victoria, compared to only around 1% across the northern states,” the report said. Emissions in the national electricity market, accounting for about 80% of Australian use, hit a record first-quarter low at 30.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, 4% lower than a year earlier. The March quarter jump in wholesale prices may have a way to run. Aemo said outlooks were influenced by the closure timing of plants in NSW and the delayed return of major units on outage including Callide C4 and Swanbank E in Queensland. Higher fuel costs were also expected, particularly in NSW where elevated prices extend into 2025. Future prices in the state rose $51/MWh in the quarter to $131/MWh, the highest among the states, and exceeding the level hit in Victoria after the Hazelwood brown coal-fired plant shut in 2017. By contrast, Queensland 2023 prices are at $108/MWh, South Australia’s $78/MWh, while Victoria’s were the lowest among the mainland states at $61/MWh. In Western Australia, operational demand rose 5.9% from March 2021. “Extended high temperatures contributed to the [WA market] recording its second-highest maximum operational demand of 3,980MW on 19 January 2022.” That was just 26MW shy of the record set in February 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T08:33:21Z","webTitle":"Paul Keating labels Aukus submarine pact ‘worst deal in all history’ in attack on Albanese government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government","fields":{"bodyText":"Paul Keating has labelled the $368bn Aukus nuclear submarine plan as the “worst deal in all history” and “the worst international decision” by a Labor government since Billy Hughes tried to introduce conscription. The former Labor prime minister launched an extraordinary broadside against the Albanese government at the National Press Club on Wednesday, blasting the “incompetence” of Labor backing the decision to sign up to Aukus while in opposition and when it had “no mandate” to do so. Keating also singled out the defence and foreign affairs ministers, Richard Marles and Penny Wong, as “seriously unwise”, arguing Wong had run the “smallest of small-target” strategies by backing Liberal strategic policies to win government, allowing defence interests to trump diplomacy. Keating brushed aside human rights concerns about China by arguing there are “disputes about what the nature of the Chinese affront to the Uyghurs” is, in reference to documented abuses that the UN has said are likely to be “crimes against humanity”. Keating is a noted dove towards China. He has previously labelled Taiwan “not a vital Australian interest” but rather a “civil matter” for China. China sees Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people, as a wayward province and has not ruled out taking it by force. On Wednesday Keating said China “is not the Soviet Union” because it is involved in international institutions and would “fall over themselves to have a proper relationship” with Australia, except that Australia has “manufactured a problem” through its increasing alignment with US. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Keating argued that China is “not going to attack us and have never threatened to attack us”, suggesting that the Aukus trilateral partnership is instead about preserving US “hegemony” in east Asia by seeking to contain China. “What Anthony Albanese has done this week, he’s screwed into place the last shackle in the long chain which the Americans have laid out to contain China,” he said. Keating said the “great sin” China had committed in the eyes of the west was developing its economy to equal the size of the US, suggesting the Americans “would have preferred” 20% of the world population remains in poverty. He also mocked aligning with the UK, which he said is “looking around for suckers” to create “global Britain … after that fool [Boris] Johnson destroyed their place in Europe”. The $368bn being spent to acquire as few as eight nuclear submarines – Virginia class and next-generation SSN-Aukus submarines – was the “worst deal in all history”, he said, because it could buy 40 to 50 conventional submarines instead. Keating also revealed that France, which lost a contract for conventional Attack class submarines in favour of Aukus, had offered “a new deal” for the “newest French nuclear submarines”. These would require only “5% enriched uranium, not 95%, weapons grade” and came with a “firm delivery date” of 2034 at “fixed prices”, he said. The French received “no response”, Keating claimed. The French embassy in Canberra declined to comment on the submarine offer claims. Marles was also contacted for a response. Keating spent 13 years on the board of the China Development Bank, including 10 as chairman, a role he left five years ago. Keating said he received a $5,000 honorarium for the board role and has “no commercial interests in China whatsoever”. He rejected any suggestion that a former Australian prime minister “would compromise his views” for sitting on an international board. Keating last week described the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s coverage suggesting war with China was possible within three years as “the most egregious and provocative news presentation” in five decades. In a tetchy performance on Wednesday, Keating refused to answer questions about another topic (superannuation) and repeatedly targeted journalists based on their outlet or previous publications about China. Keating deflected a question about whether he would direct any invective at China for its treatment of Uyghurs and of Hong Kong by arguing that “[the Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi has the same sorts of problems as the Chinese have” but the media are a “soft touch on India”. “What if the Chinese said – what about deaths in custody of Aboriginal people in your prison system? Wouldn’t that be a valid point for them?” Keating accused Albanese of “dropping the word ‘sovereignty’ into every sentence” about Aukus and warning this does not make it real. When Scott Morrison approached Labor seeking bipartisan support for Aukus in 2021, Keating claimed the opposition was briefed at 4pm and agreed within 24 hours despite having “no mandate” from Labor members. “How would you do this in 24 hours? You can only do it if you have no perceptive ability to understand the weight of the decisions you’re being asked to make,” he said. “It’s what other people call incompetence.” When asked about apparent improvements in Australia’s relationship with China since the election, Keating labelled this view “naive”. He warned that “no mealy mouthed talk of stabilisation … or the resort to soft language will disguise from the Chinese the extent and intent of the commitment to the United States hegemony”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/jul/03/memory-games-how-to-boost-your-brain-power","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-03T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Memory games: how to boost your brain power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/03/memory-games-how-to-boost-your-brain-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/jul/03/memory-games-how-to-boost-your-brain-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Reverse the ‘forgetting curve’ The forgetting curve is a visual representation of how much we forget if we don’t try to retain what we learn (a lot; pretty much everything). To combat that, it’s vital to test your recall at intervals. You don’t need to try to remember something specific: Nishant Kasibhatla, memory expert, grand master of memory and memory Guinness record holder, says you can improve your memory by practising recall at any time. Try it when you next get a coffee: “Who were the people in the queue? What colour was that poster? What else was on the menu?” Be sure to get enough sleep This isn’t just basic life hygiene: recent research seems to confirm the vital role sleep plays in memory consolidation. Like a mental Marie Kondo, some sleep phases are crucial for sorting memories: choosing what to keep and what to discard. Use flashcards If you are learning something concrete, flashcards are a great tool for “spaced recall”: you learn when you create the cards, then use them at intervals to test yourself. Medical students swear by the Anki Flashcards app, which works out algorithmically which topics you need testing on more frequently. Get playful Matching-card memory games derive from Pelmanism, an early 20th-century brain-training system that claimed to correct “tendencies to indolence and inefficiency”. There are some fiendish versions now, with subtly different Portuguese tile patterns, or Frank Lloyd Wright geometric designs. Alternatively, the Alzheimer’s Society can send you a monthly “brain workout” in return for a donation, or if jigsaws are your jam, keep going: research shows they are good for cognitive function. Build a ‘mind palace’ Loci, or mind palaces, like Sherlock’s, were first mentioned back in 80BCE and the technique is still used by today’s competitive memory athletes (yes, it’s a thing). Basically, you place what you want to remember along a “journey”. “Think of a sequence of locations you know really well, such as rooms in your house, or places in your town,” says competitive memory athlete Katie Kermode, who uses former homes, and a holiday through the US for hers. “Then put the objects in those locations. Then, when you want to recall them, you go through your journey and think ‘What object was here?’” I try a very simple version, “putting” a five-item shopping list on parts of my body. It works: “Shoulder, shallots, humerus, hummus!” I cry triumphantly in Waitrose, like a deranged middle-class bingo caller. Make dates and events visual For birthdays and other dates, Kermode suggests attributing an object to each month (“October might be a pumpkin; February a love heart”) and an image to the day. To remember a birthday on 4 February, Kermode suggests, “It can be as simple as the number 4 looks like a sailboat, so you can imagine they really love boats.” If you want to remember your schedule, associate each day of the week with an event or place: “Wednesday could be a wedding you’ve been to, so all the things you’re supposed to do on Wednesday, you could imagine happening at that wedding.” Pump iron (if you’re a mouse) Osteocalcin, a hormone released by bones that can be boosted by weightlifting, appears to have a key role in retaining memories in old age, according to research from Columbia University. However, as the excellent Twitter account @Justsaysinmice would emphasise, for results, we’re talking rodents for now. Find a hook for names “Names don’t generally mean anything,” says Kermode, whose four world records include memorising 224 names in 15 minutes. That means you have to make them meaningful to you. When you’re introduced to someone, “Come up with something that’s similar to that word, or something that rhymes with it: Brian could be ‘brain’, or Dominic could be domino; Dave likes to rave.” Think like a pianist Classical soloists perform hours of music live, from memory. Susan Tomes is a concert pianist and author whose belt-and-braces approach to performance combines muscle memory built through repetition, visual recall of the pages of her score and what she calls “an intellectual understanding of the shape of the music”: knowing how a piece is structured. That can work for public speaking, too: learn the logical shape of what you’re going to say, visualise where you are physically on your page, and practise with an audience. As Tomes says: “The presence of other people does extraordinary things to your consciousness and you have to learn to deal with them so you don’t come unstuck.” Reframe your memory When your memory fails, says Kasibhatla, tell yourself: “It’s OK, I will remember it next time,” since creating stress around your memory inevitably makes things worse. Conversely, when you remember something – and we do, every day, even if it’s the lyrics to a one-hit wonder from 1986 – tell yourself “I have a great memory.” “We all have memory successes,” says Kasibhatla. “You don’t give yourself credit for that. It’s unfair.” Learn a poem by heart Memory can be pure pleasure: remind yourself by learning a poem. “One of the absolutely beautiful things about poetry is the form, and the form lends itself super well to learning,” says Esther Sandys, an English teacher and Poetry by Heart supporter and enthusiast. Her tips? Learn in bite-size chunks, choose a poem you love (“It’s going to become part of you, probably for the rest of your life”) and combine visual, auditory and kinetic memory aids. That could mean retyping the poem with a helpful layout, recording it on to your phone with gaps between lines, and revising as you walk, iron, drive or wash up. I spoke to Sandys on Friday, and by Saturday night, had memorised one of my favourites (Snow by Louis MacNeice). I’m hooked and planning my next – it’s like creating your own mental Spotify. Use striking visual images Derren Brown’s Memory audiobook gives a great example of this: the dusty moth-filled cupboard that is my perimenopausal brain can still recall his list of 12 random words (telephone, sausage, monkey, button, book, cabbage, glass, mouse, stomach, cardboard, ferry, Christmas) effortlessly forwards and backwards. That’s thanks to the bizarre pictures Brown paints, associating each word with the next: dialling a rotary phone with a frankfurter; a monkey buttoning your shirt… The rules: choose vivid images, the weirder the better; you should feel some emotional engagement (funny or disgusting work well) and the two elements should interact in the image you create, actively if possible. Improve – at any age The average wannabe London cabby doing the Knowledge (25,000 streets and 20,000 landmarks) is in their 40s; one current candidate is late 60s. “Absolutely anyone can get through it,” says Transport for London Knowledge Manager and former cabby, Katie Chennells. The biggest challenge is “learning to learn”. After that, it’s just about commitment. There’s no magic involved: it’s about “repetition, repetition, repetition,” she says, until you can visualise each route. There are a few tricks, though: mnemonics, such as Little Apples Grow Slowly for the Lyric, Apollo, Gielgud and Sondheim theatres; and learning some city history helped Chennells remember stubborn places. Research shows the process actually expands drivers’ hippocampi. Make mistakes Research published earlier this year explores the “derring effect” (deliberate erring): making conscious errors can promote deeper understanding and better recall, with learners who inserted then corrected deliberate errors learning approximately double those who put the right answer first time. Truly, the mind and memory are mysterious."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/sep/17/rina-sawayama-hold-the-girl-review-poetry-power-and-pure-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-17T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rina Sawayama: Hold the Girl review – poetry, power and pure pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/17/rina-sawayama-hold-the-girl-review-poetry-power-and-pure-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/sep/17/rina-sawayama-hold-the-girl-review-poetry-power-and-pure-pop","fields":{"bodyText":"We live in dizzying times, in which cognitive dissonance seems like a default state. When Rina Sawayama’s debut album, Sawayama, landed in April 2020, it not only chimed with the mood of the day, it coincided with the intensity of lockdown. Sawayama was a head-spinning record that itself turned a fair few heads. Its big emotions and post-ironic sonics called to disrupted lives everywhere. It was often very good. It was also often bad, particularly when it was pointlessly tendentious. The singer eloquently itemised the pain of her childhood and her vexed relationship with her mother, a Japanese woman raising her daughter alone in Britain in straitened circumstances. Sawayama went in hard on racist microaggressions, and she sang about her sexuality (she identifies as pansexual) and finding her chosen family in a set of songs that thumbed their collective nose at genre – nothing wrong there – but also at all subtlety. The album paired scything violins with hokey metal riffs, melodies from Broadway musicals with edgy digitals. Fortunately, Sawayama’s big voice and searing intelligence – she is a Cambridge graduate – also threw itself at 90s pop structures, wrapped itself around retro R&amp;B. But as authentic as Sawayama’s internal weather was, too often she ruined perfectly good songs by slapping tokenistic riffs all over them, the aural equivalent of wearing a Slayer T-shirt bought from TK Maxx. The album’s best cuts – Comme des Garçons, Bad Friend – were straight-up tunes that did not sound like Sawayama and her producer had played some contrived game of lucky dip from the false metal-plus-another-genre bowl. Since then, she has worked with like-minded artists including Charli XCX and a hero, Elton John. But how might Sawayama follow Sawayama? Doom-metal Greatest Showman? Chamber dubstep? A track called Frankenstein seems to bode ill for cogency. The answer should surprise no one: Sawayama knows where her allegiances truly lie. Hold the Girl is an out-and-out pop album. Its pole stars are Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, its magnetic north 00s pop/R&amp;B, its side-gig hi-NRG Eurodance. Gone is the pursuit of fusion for fusion’s sake. Sawayama does make some highly eclectic choices, but these work far more coherently. The title track packs in the intro to Madonna’s Like a Prayer and a disco string flurry over a ticklish two-step beat. All that should not compute but does, landing this album firmly in 00s London, where Sawayama grew up, rebelling hard. There’s more two-step on Imagining, and vocal effects that pitch-shift her already impressive melisma to the Middle East. The elegant pluck of Indian strings introduces Your Age. Sawayama remains eclectic, but Frankenstein turns out to be a new wave workout rather than some obnoxious cut-up. Hugeness remains the singer’s ultimate goal. Now she is happy to take route one; some big-name producers such as Paul Epworth (Adele) and Stuart Price (Madonna) are on hand to steer. This Hell is a potent soft rock banger that, like Lil Nas X, shrugs at fundamentalist Christian carryings-on about damnation and keeps on loving. There’s something of Shania Twain singing Bon Jovi about it, but not so you’d mind. Lofty and wistful, Catch Me in the Air bears the imprimatur of Swift. So does Phantom, a ballad whose specifics – “stickers and scented gel pens” – feel as if they learned their granularity at Swift’s knee. Country pop is a logical staging post: Send My Love to John is a tender lyric written in honour of a queer friend that weighs up the reluctance of immigrant parents to comprehend their children’s sexualities. It ends well: “Send my love to John,” offers the mum, belatedly acknowledging a same-sex partner. Sawayama is a really important writer, one whose lyrics also scan beautifully. The opening track, Minor Feelings, takes its title from a book by the poet Cathy Park Hong about growing up Asian in America. It names feelings that society would rather young women of colour dismissed. If Sawayama’s debut chewed over her childhood, Hold the Girl has a lot to say about traumatic events she experienced as a young woman; it’s the result of a lot of therapy. Your Age bristles with outrage, the same kind that fuels Billie Eilish’s Your Power. Like a lot of recent albums by female pop artists hitting their 30s, this is a record about coming home to yourself, about feeling truly alive, one with the added benefit of being stuffed with bangers and not overburdened by corny shredding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2023/jan/23/abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-david-carrick-jenny-holzer","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Abuse of power comes as no surprise’: after David Carrick, Jenny Holzer’s words are more relevant than ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/23/abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-david-carrick-jenny-holzer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jan/23/abuse-of-power-comes-as-no-surprise-david-carrick-jenny-holzer","fields":{"bodyText":"“Abuse of power comes as no surprise” were the words emblazoned by Jenny Holzer on a giant electronic billboard in New York City’s Times Square in 1982.

When Boris Johnson lied during his premiership. It echoed when Matt Hancock was claimed to have helped his friends profit from the pandemic (although he has consistently denied this was the case). When Prince Andrew was accused of sexual assault on the underage Virginia Giuffre. During the overturning of Roe v Wade. After the killing of George Floyd by policeman Derek Chauvin. Seeing the brutality of Iran’s morality police that resulted in the death of Mahsa Amini. Reading about Wayne Couzens’ murder of Sarah Everard. When is enough, enough? This statement is part of Holzer’s Truisms series which presents short phrases out of context and inserted into “real-life” scenarios: T-shirts, benches, LED screens, projections on buildings, and more. When they were first produced in the late 70s, the Truisms were devoid of explanatory context, but in recent years have become more reactive to world events, and are now resonant with political meaning. After 17 students were murdered by a 19-year-old gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida in 2018, Holzer organised, as part of her series It Is Guns, for trucks to drive around the US with LED screens on the back bearing statements including “the students were shot” and “the president backs away”. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, Holzer projected a transcript of his final words on to the walls of a Brooklyn building, along with the names of 115 Black people who had died at the hands of the police or as a result of racial violence. Through bold, loud text, she makes voices heard. Holzer’s early career coincided with the boom in political art, at a time of extremely conservative government – Ronald Reagan in America and Margaret Thatcher in Britain – that spurred younger artists to focus on activism in their art and respond to daily injustices. Mostly the children of postwar society, raised when television was the defining cultural medium, these artists took to appropriating commercial advertising, and hit the streets to communicate to the broadest audience possible. Holzer has said: “If you want to reach a general audience, it’s not art issues that are going to compel them to stop on their way to lunch, it has to be life issues.” A pioneer of implementing text as an artistic medium, Holzer had peers including the Guerrilla Girls – who pasted posters up on the streets with bold slogans that attacked the art world’s sexism (one stated: When Racism &amp; Sexism Are No Longer Fashionable, What Will Your Art Collection Be Worth?) – and Barbara Kruger, whose poster declaring “Your body is a battleground” was created in support of the pro-choice Women’s March on Washington in 1989. Influenced by the slogan Abuse of Power Comes As No Surprise, the activist group We Are Not Surprised formed in 2017 in light of the #MeToo movement. They wrote an open letter condemning sexism in the art world signed by a staggering 9,500 non-male artists, writers and curators. But should any of us be surprised? Today, Holzer’s words resonate just as powerfully. Last week, Met PC David Carrick was found guilty of sexual offences against more than 12 women, including 24 cases of rape. As a member of the protective services, he abused his power. Not only that, but the claims were announced on the same day that – as pointed out by comedian Grace Campbell, who has written poignantly about her own experience of sexual abuse – Rishi Sunak announced that he wanted to give the Met more power with draconian new laws attacking the right to protest. Power must be interrogated and held accountable. Complaints against Carrick were ignored for years. Currently, 1,000 Met officers are under investigation for sexual violence. As Sian Norris points out, “that’s one in 45 staff members in an organisation that is meant to arrest perpetrators of such crimes”. If women are not safe with the police, then what hope do we have? And how many more times will Holzer’s words come into my thoughts? • This article was amended on 25 January 2023 to include Matt Hancock’s rejection of claims that he “helped his friends” to benefit from the pandemic.

Addressing the Sydney-based Lowy Institute by video link on Thursday evening, Zelenskiy revealed Australia was offering heavy arms to Ukraine in its next package of military support to defend against Russia’s invasion. The UN general assembly will consider a resolution condemning Russia’s purported annexation of four partly occupied Ukrainian regions, but Russian officials are lobbying for a secret vote so countries don’t have to make their positions public. Zelenskiy asked Australian officials to join in diplomatic efforts to ensure next week’s UN vote was “as unanimous as possible”. “I’m asking Australia to use all of its influence to convince as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for international law and against a Russian annexation,” he said during the Lowy Institute event. Zelenskiy called on as many countries as possible to join in the “clear and straightforward condemnation” of the Kremlin, saying the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would escalate further if the response was “weak”. Putin has threatened to use all means at his disposal to defend Russian territory and has said the four Ukrainian regions would be part of Russia “forever”. Zelenskiy said on Thursday: “So even if he would decide to launch a nuclear strike, well, what can I say? I think the world will never forgive this. “I think he clearly understand that after the use of [nuclear] weapons, he would be unable any more to preserve – so to say – his life and I’m confident of that.” Zelenskiy thanked Australia for its “very meaningful” defence assistance, saying the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles had “performed masterfully”. “There’s also a significant package that Australia has been preparing,” he added. “This process is ongoing as we speak and I’m very grateful for that. I don’t want to go into details on what weapons, what’s inside this package, but it’s not only small arms but some heavy weapons as well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He urged Australia to continue to ratchet up sanctions against Russia, because the pressure campaign would be most effective if “the aggressor does not have time to circumvent those sanctions”. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s recapture of territory that Russia had claimed showed the Kremlin was not capable of holding its ground. “They can kill but they cannot survive,” he said. Asked about Ukraine’s bid to join Nato, announced last week, Zelenskiy said the alliance had to “demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia”. But the timeline for joining Nato was unclear, and “unfortunately depends not only on Ukraine”, he said. Ukraine’s forces have been trying to advance in the east and south of the country, prompting a rare admission from Putin that his troops were under pressure. Putin said earlier this week that Russia would “stabilise” the situation in the four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it claimed as its own territory last week. Australia and other countries have refused to recognise the purported annexations. Australia has gradually ramped up its assistance to Ukraine since February, first under the Morrison government and now under the Albanese government, and ministers are now considering further expanding that help amid expectations of a “protracted” conflict. Australia’s $388m in pledged military assistance to Ukraine includes 60 Bushmaster vehicles, unmanned aerial systems, anti-armour weapons and equipment to remove bombs littering the battlefield. Both major parties in Australia have said helping Ukraine respond to Russia’s “illegal, immoral” invasion is important for broader preservation of international stability – including in the Indo-Pacific, where China has not ruled out taking Taiwan by force. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the Australian government was considering longer term support “to put Ukraine in a position where ultimately this conflict can be resolved on its terms”. “The unprovoked aggression from Russia in respect of Ukraine, is such a flouting of the UN charter, of the global rules-based order, it must not be allowed to stand,” Marles said after a meeting with his American and Japanese counterparts in Hawaii last weekend. So far, however, Australia has stopped short of expelling Russian diplomats – a move officials fear would trigger retaliatory expulsions of Australian diplomats in Moscow. Zelenskiy made a direct appeal for Bushmaster vehicles when he addressed the Australian parliament by video link in late March – equipment that Canberra later agreed to supply. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s defence ministry posted video of its forces using an Australian-supplied Bushmaster to tow a Russian amphibious armoured personnel carrier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Iran gloats, America plots, but even a nuclear deal will not tame Tehran | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","fields":{"bodyText":"If any one man is to blame for gleeful Iranian crowing over the attack on Salman Rushdie, it is the country’s 83-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. The black-turbaned ayatollah’s bigoted, blinkered outlook has been poisoning the well of Iranian politics and society since he first took power in 1989. Kayhan newspaper, known as Khamenei’s mouthpiece, praised Rushdie’s assailant, saying “his hands should be showered with kisses”. A jubilant headline declared: “Devil’s neck under the sword”. While Iran denies responsibility for the attack, Khamenei has repeatedly endorsed the late Ruhollah Khomeini’s fatwa ordering Rushdie’s murder. Such callous gloating reveals a country whose leadership has wholly lost its way, the promise of the 1979 revolution despoiled by a ruling elite’s reactionary and avaricious incompetence. The question now, as the US and Europe contemplate a revived nuclear deal with Tehran and an end to sanctions, is can this rotten regime be trusted to keep its word? Khamenei’s harshly anti-western, anti-American stance, rooted in questionable theology (scholars dispute his religious credentials), deep paranoia and profound personal ignorance of the world, is Tehran’s dominant political brand. No matter, apparently, that it impoverishes and isolates Iranians while endangering their neighbours. After last year’s rigged presidential election, won on a record low turnout by Khamenei’s hardline stooge Ebrahim Raisi, lingering hopes of reform evaporated. Internal repression is terrifying. Political dissidents, women’s rights activists, ethnic minorities, dual nationals and Bahá’ís are persecuted mercilessly. Iran’s economy, plagued by endemic corruption and sanctions, is in a shocking state. While oil and gas export earnings have risen, officials, clergy and other groups linked to the regime, such as the Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia, are the main beneficiaries. It’s a mullah’s version of trickle-down economics, without the trickle. Year-on-year inflation reached 52.5% in June. Reduced food subsidies are hurting badly. At least 30% of Iranians live below the official poverty line. Strikes are commonplace. But few have forgotten 2019’s nationwide “Bloody November” anti-regime protests, when many hundreds were gunned down. Only 28% think Raisi does a good job. “The policies that ... Khamenei has championed for three decades have pushed Iran to the brink of total economic and ecological collapse and, despite staging brutal crackdowns, the country is wallowing in social unrest ... By celebrating the assault on Rushdie, the clerical establishment seems to be saving face at home,” commentator Sayeh Isfahani wrote. Externally, Iran sides ever-more closely with Russia and China. Hosting Vladimir Putin in Tehran last month, Khamenei claimed that, just as with Iran, the west and Nato opposed a “strong, independent Russia”. Like Putin, he is delusional about his country’s global standing and scorns the US as a declining power. Iran is reportedly supplying drones to help Russia attack Ukraine. China is Iran’s biggest energy customer, with Beijing now importing more oil than before US sanctions were imposed. The two countries are also pursuing “strategic defence cooperation” after Raisi told visiting Chinese officials that Iran sought a united front against the west. Like Russia, China has taken Iran’s side on disputed UN nuclear inspections. Donald Trump’s idiotic decision to trash the 2015 nuclear pact led, predictably, to a rapid acceleration in Iran’s programme. It now says it can build a bomb within months but has no plans to do so. Short of time, the Biden administration may soon agree a revised pact – yet deal or no deal, the regime’s behaviour seems unlikely to alter radically. There’s little sign, for example, of a reining-in of its regional ambitions. Khamenei personally commands the Quds Force, Iran’s extraterritorial military arm, which operates via proxies in Yemen, Lebanon and Palestine. Israel’s hopes that, through currying favour with Putin by soft-pedalling over Ukraine, it could shatter the Russia-Iran axis in Syria have been dashed. Most disruptive right now is the huge instability rocking Iraq, caused by rivalry between Tehran-backed Shia parties and militias and the popular, anti-Iranian, anti-American nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Iran’s self-interested attempts to mediate have got nowhere. Israeli leaders are sceptical that so malign and shambolic an adversary will stick to any nuclear agreement. Israel opposes a new deal and warns of military action at any time. If its rightwing former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu regains power in elections this autumn, fears of direct confrontation will increase. Analysts in Israel question US president Joe Biden’s motives. Is he too keen to score a big foreign policy success before November’s midterm elections? Is it all about confounding Trump? Haaretz’s Amos Harel wondered why the US is ignoring what he termed recent Iranian aggression. “Just this last week, a Revolutionary Guards conspiracy to assassinate two very senior Trump administration officials, former national security adviser John Bolton and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, was exposed,” Harel noted. Then came the Rushdie horror and the Iranian media’s macabre triumphalism. Americans, too, should be deeply suspicious of Tehran’s intentions, suggested Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour – because Khamenei’s grip on power, and that of the illegitimate elite surrounding him, pivots on unceasing confrontation with the Great Satan. “US-Iran normalisation could prove deeply destabilising to a theocratic government whose organising principle has been premised on fighting American imperialism,” Sadjadpour wrote. Iran’s leaders, he argued, couldn’t change even if they wanted to. “Even if the nuclear deal is revived, Tehran’s worldview will endure.” It’s plain Khamenei needs the American enemy. But is the converse also true? For the Republican right, Iran has long been a useful bogeyman to frighten the voters, corral Gulf Arab allies and rally support for Israel. So can Iran trust the US to honour the terms of any reworked nuclear pact? Whatever the White House says now, it’s by no means certain Biden’s eventual successor will do so.

The move is an effort to tackle a spree of “review bombings” driven, in part, by an “anti-woke” backlash to the diverse casting in the company’s Lord of the Rings prequel series, The Rings of Power, which features non-white actors cast as elves and dwarfs. On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the show has an 84% average rating from critics, but a 38% average audience score. Even on IMDb, the film and TV site owned by Amazon, the show has attracted 17,500 one-star ratings, 25% of the reviews for the title, although many of them have been disregarded by the site’s “weighted average” ratings, which attempt to downrate “unusual voting activity”. Amazon’s Prime Video streaming site, however, where the new show has premiered, currently displays no customer reviews at allas a result of the delay. According to Variety, which first spotted the new practice, the streaming service uses the delay to determine whether a review is “genuine or a forgery”. The company also has another weapon against review-bombing: users cannot post a review of The Rings of Power until they have watched the show. As a result, the first reviews should appear on Monday morning, 72 hours after the first episode aired at 2am UK time on Friday. Review bombing, positive and negative, has become a fact of life for media franchises with large, dedicated and often unruly fanbases, who use sites such as Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes to leave messages in huge quantities, dragging down ratings and occasionally having a knock-on effect on the commercial success of the production. The campaigns can be triggered by anything from a backlash against casting decisions (a 2016 Ghostbusters remake was review-bombed for its all-female stars) to complaints about geopolitical slights (the video game Life is Strange: True Colours was review bombed by Chinese players for a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it inclusion of a Tibetan flag). In taking action against fake reviews for its own multimillion TV show, however, Amazon risks charges of hypocrisy over its policing of reviews elsewhere on the e-commerce site. A Which investigation this year “found that there are still unscrupulous businesses exploiting weaknesses with Amazon’s review system,” said Rocio Concha, the consumer rights group’s director of policy and advocacy, “leaving shoppers at risk of buying products boosted by thousands of bogus five-star reviews.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/06/sse-to-pay-near-10m-penalty-over-licence-breach","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T08:43:17Z","webTitle":"SSE to pay near-£10m penalty over licence breach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/06/sse-to-pay-near-10m-penalty-over-licence-breach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/06/sse-to-pay-near-10m-penalty-over-licence-breach","fields":{"bodyText":"The energy regulator has said the power generation arm of Scottish energy company SSE will pay a near-£10m penalty for breaching the terms of its licence. Ofgem said a detailed investigation had found that SSE Generation had secured “excessive payments” from the National Grid, the electricity system operator (ESO), during periods of what is known as “transmission constraint”. As a result, Ofgem has issued a penalty of £9.8m to SSE Generation. Cathryn Scott, the director of enforcement and emerging problems at Ofgem, said the regulator would “continue to monitor the wholesale energy markets in Great Britain and ensure their integrity on behalf of energy users”. She added: “This enforcement action sends another strong signal to all generators that they must put in place controls to ensure that their bid prices are set in a way that ensures that they do not obtain excessive benefits during transmission constraint periods. “If they fail to do so, they will face significant consequences.” Transmission constraint can occur when the electricity transmission system is unable to transmit power from where it is being produced to where it is required, due to congestion in the network. The ESO can take action in the market to increase and decrease the amount of electricity available at different locations on the network. The SSE penalty relates to its Foyers hydro pumped-storage power station, located in the Scottish Highlands. The regulator found that the company breached its licence after securing excessive payments in exchange for reducing its output at Foyers. SSE changed the bid prices it charged National Grid in May 2020, which the regulator said made it “significantly more expensive” to reduce Foyers’ output, including in periods of transmission constraint. Ofgem said SSE made the change to bring Foyers in line with what it believed was the market practice of other pumped-storage operators and to increase its profit. It opened an investigation into SSE Generation in October 2021. The regulator said it had not seen any evidence that SSE’s breach of its licence was deliberate. However, it added that SSE and its senior management should have realised that its revised approach “carried a significant risk” of breaching the terms of its transmission constraint licence condition. SSE said it cooperated fully with the investigation By settling the investigation early, SSE qualified for a discount on the £11.6m it would otherwise have been required to pay by Ofgem. SSE said: “We aim to comply with regulations at all times and believed we were doing so in this case. Following the investigation, we are updating our relevant procedures accordingly.” The £9.8m penalty will be paid by SSE into the energy redress fund, a scheme that distributes payments from companies that have breached Ofgem rules to charities and community benefit organisations to deliver energy-related projects. Drax, the owner of Britain’s biggest power plant, agreed in January to pay £6.1m in to the energy redress fund, after admitting to an inadvertent breach of its energy generation licence. The company’s pumped-storage unit assured Ofgem at the time it had revised the way it calculates its pricing, after the regulator found it had secured excessive payments in relation to its Cruachan power station in Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/12/morning-mail-200000-robodebt-reviews-wiped-g7-leaders-warn-putin-over-nuclear-threat-bali-bombings-remembered","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T19:59:00Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: 200,000 robodebt reviews wiped, G7 leaders warn Putin over nuclear threat, Bali bombings remembered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/morning-mail-200000-robodebt-reviews-wiped-g7-leaders-warn-putin-over-nuclear-threat-bali-bombings-remembered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/morning-mail-200000-robodebt-reviews-wiped-g7-leaders-warn-putin-over-nuclear-threat-bali-bombings-remembered","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

They spoke out after National Grid warned on Thursday that households could experience a series of three-hour electricity outages this winter to manage extreme gas shortages, for example if Vladimir Putin shuts off supplies from Russia and cold weather sends demand soaring. Such an event would mean consumers in different parts of the country being notified a day in advance of three-hour blocks of time during which their power would be cut off. The government has resisted calls for a public information campaign to encourage consumers to cut back on electricity and gas. However, the Guardian understands that after the National Grid announcement, it will direct people to trusted sites where they can get energy-saving information and tips. It was also reported that the National Grid could pay some businesses and consumers up to £10 a day to use electricity outside of peak hours. The prospect of rolling power outages caused alarm among some health groups, with particular concerns for the thousands of vulnerable patients who rely on electrical devices to keep themselves alive and healthy. Laurie Cuthbert, a director of Kidney Care UK, a health charity, said thousands of adults and children depended on a constant source of power to provide life-saving dialysis at home. “This is very energy intensive … as for some people this treatment takes place several times every day for shorter periods, and for some this takes place every day, or overnight, for up to eight to 10 hours a time,” he said. “Any interruption to the power supply would put the treatment itself at risk, and if people on dialysis miss too many sessions in a row then their lives will be at risk.” Andy Fletcher, the chief executive of Together for Short Lives, which advocates for the UK’s 99,000 seriously ill children and their families, said: “For seriously ill children a three-hour blackout could deprive them of vital life-saving equipment such as ventilators, oxygen and temperature control. Families would be forced to decide whether to admit their child to hospital, which would be extremely disruptive and distressing.” Key sites including hospitals, airports and water treatment works would not be disconnected under the proposals, unless there was a total blackout in energy supply. Rory Deighton, the director of the NHS Confederation’s acute network, said: “The NHS has robust emergency planning in place in the event of blackouts so we would expect the risk to safety to be well managed.” The director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, Miriam Deakin, added: “The cold weather can bring increased respiratory problems and falls, often affecting the most vulnerable people, including those who can’t keep their homes warm. “Power cuts would only make matters worse, adding to pressures on the NHS at a time when it is already severely stretched.” Charities called on energy companies to identify and prioritise vulnerable customers put at risk by power cuts, including people with chronic health conditions and those dependent on equipment. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: “It is essential that the National Grid prioritises vulnerable households and completely exempts them from any planned outage.” Each energy supplier operates a priority service register, which flags up vulnerable customers and ensures they are given advance warning of power cuts, are at the front of the queue when electricity is reconnected, and in some cases are eligible for portable generators, hot meals and drinks, and alternative accommodation. The register is open to people with a disability or chronic health conditions, as well as the over-60s and pregnant women or parents with children under five. About 6 million people in Great Britain are on priority service registers, according to Ofgem. Ministers have so far opposed the idea of an official drive to encourage households to save energy, despite discussing the idea with the industry and National Grid. The Guardian understands the government does not plan a formal campaign, but will instead “signpost” trusted sites like energy regulator Ofgem where the public can get advice. Government insiders denied the decision is due to an aversion to “nanny state” interventions but said it is because previous experience of running campaigns suggests people listen more to information from third parties. The government has faced criticism for a lack of commitment to renewable power projects and failing to launch a drive to encourage the public to insulate their homes. Jess Ralston, a senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “We didn’t need to be here. Had investment in energy efficiency and onshore wind gone ahead over the past few years, we’d be much more certain about meeting demand. Every spin of a wind turbine and loft lagged means less gas we need to try to buy.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has called for a “national mission” to insulate millions of homes, accusing the “zombie government” of ignoring the issue. National Grid said that in order for the power cuts to be brought in, there would have to be reduced electricity imports from Europe and insufficient gas supply to power stations. Due to archaic rules, the emergency plans to disconnect customers would need to be approved by King Charles III, after advice from his privy council, on the recommendation of the business secretary. National Grid has worked on a series of initiatives to attempt to manage supply and demand this winter. It is ready to call into action five coal-fired power plants, which can generate up to 2 gigawatts of power. It will also launch a “demand flexibility service” on 1 November that will encourage businesses and consumers to use power outside peak demand periods, including early evenings on weekdays. Consumers with smart meters will be notified the day before and will be paid for using power outside these time periods, with reports saying that payments could be as high as £10 a day. The initiative was trialled by Octopus Energy earlier this year. National Grid hopes this service will free up an extra 2GW, enough to power about 600,000 homes, if enough companies and households participate. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus, said: “Of course, blackouts are unlikely but we could eliminate them altogether. Instead of cutting off whole chunks of the country if we are short of gas, we can reward people who choose to use less energy at times of peak demand. “After all, some people have critical needs – for example when using electrical medical equipment – whilst others are happy to watch Netflix on a laptop for a while.” Ovo, the third-largest energy supplier in the UK, said it would pay customers a total of £100 to move their non-essential energy use to times when the demand was lower. It said that households used 19% of their daily usage between 4pm and 7pm, when pressure on the grid was at its highest. Regulators hope long-term to align energy supplies more closely with demand to help the switch towards renewable energy, which becomes less reliable in times of low wind. Work is already under way to delink the price of electricity from gas and build an energy system. Asked on a visit to Prague on Thursday about the guarantee she made during her leadership campaign that there would be no electricity blackouts this winter, Liz Truss said: “We do have a good supply of energy in the UK, we’re in a much better position than many other countries, but of course there’s always more we can do, and that’s why I’m here working with our partners, making sure we do have a secure energy supply into the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"‘Everything we do is about connection’: 50 years of Pacha and the Ibiza club scene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/22/50-years-of-pacha-ibiza","fields":{"bodyText":"The year was 2010, the last vestige of time in which, when the beat dropped in the club, there would be thousands of hands in the air simultaneously cutting through the laser lights instead of holding up little glowing bars to film it. Swedish House Mafia, the superstar DJ trio comprising Steve Angello, Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso, had taken over the world with their euphoric Eurodance bangers, and those who’d managed to get into their residency night at Pacha, the superclub in Ibiza’s Mediterranean Old Town, knew that they were at the centre of the island’s best party. But they weren’t prepared for what happened next. Pacha’s twin cherry logos glowed red and, suddenly, on a platform before the crowd appeared none other than Kylie Minogue, delivering an impromptu reworking of Can’t Get You Out of My Head, the irresistible beats of which now came courtesy of Swedish House Mafia. “It was an explosion. Nobody knew it was going to happen,” says Francisco Ferrer, a local man who started working for Pacha in 1985 selling tickets and would become its global brand ambassador. “You could feel the happiness of people around the room,” he says. “It’s a big memory.” He had devised the performance with Kylie, who enjoyed the club so much she would often go incognito with her friends to dance in the middle of the crowd. Ferrer and I are speaking inside an eerily empty Pacha while technicians tinker away in the DJ booth. In just a few hours’ time, the doors will open to thousands of clubbers for the nightclub’s opening party, heralding the unofficial start of the season. Opening party weekend here is always a big one, but as it’s Pacha’s 50th anniversary, tonight will be particularly exceptional. The anniversary marks not just five decades of the island’s oldest club, but of Ibiza partying itself. When Ferrer was born in 1964, just a few hundred yards away from Pacha, Ibiza was a remote island unknown to many in the rest of Europe. But the seeds of its identity as a hedonistic, free and inclusive paradise had already begun to germinate. Word spread of a mythical white island with irrepressible natural beauty that had become Spain’s unofficial refuge from General Franco’s fascist government. Ibiza soon drew the first hippies and beatniks from the US who were fleeing conscription from the Vietnam war, instead forming free-love communes and throwing raves in the rugged centre and north of the island. In Eivissa Town, across the marina from Pacha, the Calle de la Virgen street was a hallowed LGBTQ+ sanctuary. A young entrepreneur named Ricardo Urgell, having already founded the first Pacha nightclub in Sitges, Catalonia, visited Ibiza in the early 70s and was determined to create the first official discotheque there. Ignoring financial advisers who complained that a bunch of hippies was too small a group of people to cater for, Urgell converted an old whitewashed farmhouse into a party palace and, in 1973, Pacha Ibiza was born. Flower Power, the club’s earliest themed night, is still going to this day – playing 60s and 70s music. Resplendent with daisies and peace signs, the farmhouse once famously played Imagine while an elevated bed made its way through the crowd, upon which languished a pair of joint-smoking John Lennon and Yoko Ono impersonators. At another Flower Power night, Ferrer remembers finding Mick Jagger – the real one – in an empty room. Old Snake Hips was alone, swaying, in the centre of the dancefloor, absorbed in the music. “Do you want something to drink?” Ferrer asked him, tentatively. “No,” Jagger replied. “I’m here to listen to this music. I’m alone here; nobody can disturb me and I can dance and be myself.” By the 1980s and 90s, Ibiza was the island of personalities, and Pacha, as the sassiest, glitziest club, was “the place to be and be seen”. Any celebrity worth their salt partied there. Grace Jones was always cutting shapes while a slew of designers – Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier – and their entourages packed out the VIP booths with gold jewellery and haughty smiles. The concept of a “superstar DJ” did not yet exist, which meant the crowd and the club itself were the spectacle. Palm trees. Chandeliers of fireworks. Confetti explosions. Smoke cannon. Strobe lights. Fire-breathers. And as well as the ravers, there were the go-go dancers: beautiful women and men complementing the aural fiesta. “It was freeness,” recalls Ferrer. “You met a lot of people because maybe you are dancing and meet people next to you, then begin to speak to them, you know? There was no telephone, there was no Instagram. It was natural. Now society is very performing.” By the late 1980s, house music was permeating from the turntables of Frankie Knuckles and Marshall Jefferson in Chicago warehouse raves. These infectious 120bpm sounds soon landed on the shores of the White Isle, where the hedonism of Pacha, Amnesia and Ku Club (the biggest club in the world, later renamed Privilege) had reached its zenith – enough to influence four British blokes to import elements of the scene to the UK. Paul Oakenfold, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Danny Rampling were blown away in 1987 by the Balearic beats, raves that lasted for days, and their first ecstasy experiences. As soon as they landed back in London they launched their own club nights, Spectrum, Shoom and The Trip, and what happened next is well-worn UK house history: illegal raves, ecstasy, the Smiley face, tabloid hysteria and the 1988 “second summer of love”. The next chapter is considered by many Britons (but perhaps by fewer Spaniards) as the “golden era” of Ibiza – all despite the insalubrious 18-30s package holidays, turbo-shandies on San Antonio’s strip and “Brits abroad” behaviour as captured by the Ibiza Uncovered TV series. The songs of the 1990s are timeless: Café Del Mar by Energy 52; Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust; 9PM (Till I Come) by ATB; Children by Robert Miles; You Don’t Know Me by Armand Van Helden, and; Needin’ U, from Pacha’s resident DJ, David Morales. By then, the aftershocks of the ’Beefa boom were reverberating around the world. The 00s, however, were when Pacha hit its commercial peak. It was one of the first major clubs to book David Guetta, who, despite having now amassed 10 million album sales, was paid for his first sets with the money Ferrer and his crew made from selling branded T-shirts that day. In the first year of the new millennium, Paul Oakenfold was a resident DJ, playing mammoth sets lasting until 9am. And the British invasion was cemented with Darren Emerson’s Underwater nights and sets from Paul Woolford and X Press 2 and Groove Armada. For Simon Dunmore, the founder and former CEO of Defected Records, the label that hosted a summer-long season at Pacha for eight years between 2005 to 2012, the 00s was “the rise of the superclubs”. “It was the early days of the internet, and reputations grew over that period of time because people were way more connected,” he says. Dunmore’s most memorable Pacha moment was in 2001, when Defected had released Roger Sanchez’s Another Chance, which was at No 1 in the UK singles chart. Dunmore describes the goosebumps moment in the club when Sanchez “looped up the beginning of the chords and teased it in for a couple of minutes. “When the record eventually came in, the club just exploded,” he recalls. “The head of music at Radio 1 was there and we ended up hugging each other,” he says, adding: “It’s mad isn’t it, how music brings people together?” The subsequent decade saw previously underground electronic music enter the mainstream, and cemented Ibiza’s reputation as a rite of passage for any dance music fan. Yet the commercialisation of dance saw aspects of the island fall victim to rampant capitalism, notably through eye-watering drinks prices, a ballooning VIP culture and overcrowding on the dancefloors. The balance between Ibiza’s outlaw heritage and modern gloss is an ongoing issue. There are distinctly more private jets and yachts than in yesteryear, but Sanjay Nandi, the CEO of Pacha Group, believes people of all demographics are still attracted to the island. “It’s not possible to fill superclubs entirely with high-net-worth individuals,” he says. Last month, at its 50th opening season party, the Pacha crew and progenitors of those cheeky red cherries were looking ahead to many more decades of decadence to come. Multiplatinum British DJ duo CamelPhat have joined the 2023 residency billing alongside a heterogeneous music programme that includes the desert sounds of Bedouin, the techno of Marco Carola and, of course, the 60s and 70s grooves of the Flower Power night. Yet while Pacha diversifies, Jessica Capaz McCarthy, Pacha Group’s artistic director, argues the club’s ethos will remain the same. “I feel like when you go to a nightclub it’s all about the feeling of connection, and everything we do is about connection,” she says. “That’s what makes people feel like they had the best night of their lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/27/no-victorian-greenslide-but-progressives-on-track-for-upper-house-balance-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T05:33:14Z","webTitle":"Victorian ‘Greenslide’ fails to eventuate but progressives on track for upper house balance of power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/27/no-victorian-greenslide-but-progressives-on-track-for-upper-house-balance-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/27/no-victorian-greenslide-but-progressives-on-track-for-upper-house-balance-of-power","fields":{"bodyText":"As her forecast “Greenslide” failed to materialise on Sunday, the Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, turned her attention to hopes the party can hold the balance of power in the upper house to influence a returned Daniel Andrews government. Ratnam was buoyant on Saturday night, declaring a surge in support off the back of early election results that showed a number of lower house seats in play for the minor party. But while the Greens picked up the historically safe Labor seat of Richmond to add to the party’s three seats in the previous parliament, a strong flow of prepoll and postal votes to their opponents saw any additional hopes largely evaporate over the next 24 hours. Their best chance of an additional seat remains Northcote, where they trailed Labor by 865 votes on Sunday afternoon. Addressing reporters at lunchtime on Sunday, Ratnam said she was confident the party could pick up three seats in the upper house, where she was the only Greens MP in the last term. The Greens candidate Katherine Copsey has been elected for the Southern Metropolitan region and the party also hopes to secure representation in the North-Eastern Metropolitan and Western Victorian regions. “We’re willing to work constructively and cooperatively with this Labor government to get really progressive reform in areas like climate, housing, integrity and so much more,” Ratnam said. “We’re in a powerful position to be able to do that.” The electoral analyst Ben Raue said the Greens were likely to share the upper house balance of power, alongside other progressive parties that could include the Animal Justice, Reason and Legalise Cannabis parties. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Labor relied on a similar progressive crossbench to pass legislation in the last parliament, but Raue predicted the government’s position in the upper house would worsen. “Labor will have a smaller number than they do now [and] there will be a progressive bloc that the Greens will be part of. That is the most feasible pathway forward,” he told Guardian Australia. The Greens had high hopes of securing the balance of power in the lower house but Labor cruised to victory and may yet exceed the 55 of 88 seats it won at the 2018 election. The Greens had won 10.9% of the lower house primary vote as of Sunday afternoon, which was up slightly on 2018 (10.7%), but a smaller share than the party received in both the 2010 (11.2%) and 2014 (11.5%) elections. Pressed on this, Ratnam said the party had received significant swings on a two-party-preferred basis. The Liberals’ decision to preference Labor last across the state meant opposition preferences flowed to the Greens. “We know the count is still continuing,” she said. “There’s still races that are too close to call, but this is a strong result for the Greens.” Addressing media on Sunday, Andrews made a thinly veiled swipe at the Greens, saying “no member of my team is going to be sitting in the parliament as a result of Liberal party preferences”. But Ratnam hit back, saying the party had won seats because “voters care about the issues that we were willing to engage them on”. “And we’ve seen the progressive vote rise right across the city,” she said. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Sunday dismissed talk of a “Greenslide” and inflated claims about the shift towards minor parties. “I know that some will declare that the major party process is somehow not ever going to be successful again. Well, I lead a majority Labor government, Daniel Andrews has just been elected for a third term with a majority Labor government,” he told reporters on Sunday. Labor and the Coalition received 72.1% of the primary vote during counting on Sunday afternoon, down from 78.1% in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-search-trump-mar-a-lago-home-classified-nuclear-weapons-documents-report","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T17:13:33Z","webTitle":"FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home for classified nuclear weapons documents – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-search-trump-mar-a-lago-home-classified-nuclear-weapons-documents-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-search-trump-mar-a-lago-home-classified-nuclear-weapons-documents-report","fields":{"bodyText":"FBI agents were looking for secret documents about nuclear weapons among other classified material when they searched Donald Trump’s home on Monday, it has been reported. The Washington Post cited people familiar with the investigation as saying nuclear weapons documents were thought to be in the trove the FBI was hunting in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. They did not specify what kind of documents or whether they referred to the US arsenal or another country’s. The former US president on Friday denounced the investigation as “a hoax”, while asking for the warrant issued in the search to be released – even though a copy of that and of the list of property taken by the federal government are already in the possession of his legal team, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said. The report came hours after the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said on Thursday that he had personally authorised the government request for a search warrant and revealed that the justice department had asked a Florida court for the warrant to be unsealed, noting that Trump himself had made the search public. The DoJ motion referred to “the public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred in its contents”. Trump later released a statement saying he would not oppose but rather was “encouraging the immediate release of those documents” related to what he called the “un-American, unwarranted, and unnecessary raid and break-in … Release the documents now!” Early on Friday morning, Trump further stated, via his social media platform Truth Social, that he believes the “nuclear weapons issue is a hoax”, comparing it to other investigations he has called hoaxes in the past, including the Mueller investigation into allegations of collusion between his 2016 election campaign and the Russian government and his historic double impeachment. “Some sleazy people involved,” he said, adding “planting information, anyone?” Garland’s announcement followed a furious backlash to the search from Trump supporters who portrayed it as politically motivated. On Thursday a man who tried to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati office was shot and killed by police after he fled the scene. The court told the government to present its motion to Trump’s lawyers and to report back by 3pm on Friday on whether Trump objected to the warrant being unsealed. Several US national media outlets, including the New York Times, CBS, the Washington Post, CNN and NBC have asked the court to unseal everything related to the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. Nancy Pelosi condemned the attacks by Trump and other Republicans on the FBI, whose agents Garland hailed as patriotic public servants. Speaking at a press conference before the speaker was to preside over the House vote on her party’s landmark climate legislation, Pelosi also reacted to the Thursday attack on an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio, by a man who may have been present at the January 6 insurrection. “You would think there would be an adult in the Republican room that would say just calm down, see what the facts are and let’s go for that instead of again instigating assaults on law enforcement,” Pelosi said. Donald Trump is known to be mulling whether to announce another campaign for president at an early date, potentially before the November midterm election, and immediately began a fundraising push after announcing the FBI search, which he described as a break-in although his Secret Service agents were given notice and the federal agents were escorted into the compound. “President Donald Trump is Joe Biden’s most likely political opponent in 2024 and this is less than 100 days from critical midterm elections. The FBI raid of President Trump is a complete abuse and overreach of its authority,” said Elise Stefanik, the number-three House Republican, at a press conference. The suspected presence of nuclear weapons documents at Mar-a-Lago could explain why Garland took such a politically charged and unprecedented step as ordering FBI agents into a former president’s house. Trump was particularly fixated on the US nuclear arsenal while he was in the White House, and boasted about being privy to highly secret information. In the summer of 2017 he told US military leaders he wanted an arsenal comparable to its cold war peak, which would have involved a tenfold increase, a demand that reportedly led the then secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, describe him as a “fucking moron”. Trump publicly threatened to obliterate both North Korea and Afghanistan. In his book on the Trump presidency, Rage, Bob Woodward quoted the former president as telling him: “We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody – what we have is incredible.” Woodward said he was later told the US did indeed have an unspecified new weapons system, and officials were “surprised” that Trump had disclosed the fact. Cheryl Rofer, a chemist who worked on nuclear weapons at the Los Alamos national laboratory said there were varying classification levels applying to different kinds of documentation. “Information about the design of nuclear weapons is called Restricted Data and is ‘born classified’. That means it is assumed to be classified unless declassified,” Rofer, who writes a blog titled Nuclear Diner, wrote on Twitter. But she added: “There’s no reason for a president to have nuclear weapons design information that I can see.” Among the nuclear documents that Trump would routinely have had access to would be the classified version of the Nuclear Posture Review, about US capabilities and policies. A military aide is always close to the president carrying the “nuclear football”, a briefcase containing nuclear strike options, but it would be unusual for those documents to be taken out of the football. Another possibility Rofer pointed to is that Trump could have retained his nuclear “biscuit”, a piece of plastic like a credit card with the identification codes necessary for nuclear launch. Those codes would have been changed however the moment Biden took office at noon on 20 January 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/03/aukus-biden-urged-to-fast-track-research-into-submarines-using-non-weapons-grade-uranium","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"Aukus: Biden urged to fast-track research into submarines using non-weapons grade uranium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/03/aukus-biden-urged-to-fast-track-research-into-submarines-using-non-weapons-grade-uranium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/03/aukus-biden-urged-to-fast-track-research-into-submarines-using-non-weapons-grade-uranium","fields":{"bodyText":"The Biden administration is being urged to fast-track research into submarines that do not use weapons-grade uranium, as four Democratic politicians warn the Aukus deal with Australia makes the task “even more pressing”. Australia’s deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, arrived in the United States for crucial talks with the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Friday (US time), amid renewed congressional concerns about aspects of the flagship Aukus project. With March looming as the deadline for key decisions on how Australia acquires at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with help from the US and the UK, all three countries maintain the work remains on track. But in the latest sign of congressional jitters, four politicians from Joe Biden’s party have sounded the alarm about broader risks to the global nuclear non-proliferation system. A newly published letter coordinated by Bill Foster, a physicist serving as US representative for an Illinois congressional district, asks the Biden administration to ramp up research into alternatives to using weapons-grade uranium to power submarines. It adds to concerns already raised by experts that if the Australian submarines are powered by highly enriched uranium (HEU), other countries may seek to follow the precedent – even though they will not be armed with nuclear weapons. “It is more important than ever to promote the safe, secure, and peaceful use of nuclear technologies,” wrote Foster and fellow US representatives Rick Larsen and Donald Beyer, and US senator Jeffrey Merkley. They noted Biden had authorised funding of $20m to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for nuclear fuels development. But in a letter to the administrator of the NNSA and the navy secretary, the politicians formally requested a detailed report on “the feasibility and performance impact of a Virginia-Class replacement SSN(X) nuclear-powered attack submarine” that is fuelled by a low-enriched uranium (LEU) reactor with a life-of-the-ship core. They said previous reports indicated it “may be feasible for the navy to use LEU fuel for naval nuclear propulsion, as France and China already do”. “A leading technical challenge is that a greater volume of LEU fuel is required to produce the same amount of energy as HEU fuel,” the letter said. “The Naval Reactors office has suggested this would not pose a problem for existing aircraft carriers, which have sufficient space for a larger LEU reactor core. However, submarines face more severe space constraints, raising a question that we request you address in a report to Congress.” The politicians said this research was “even more pressing with the September 2021 Aukus agreement under which the US and UK will provide nuclear submarine technology to Australia”. “Minimizing the global presence of HEU by reducing its use in military applications would reduce the risks associated with making and transporting HEU and demonstrate significant leadership on nonproliferation,” the letter said. The Australian government has said it will comply with the highest non-proliferation standards and pledged to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty does not ban non-nuclear weapon countries like Australia from having nuclear-powered ships. James Acton, a co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has previously argued that Aukus depends on “a glaring and worrying loophole in IAEA safeguards” that could be exploited by others. This loophole allows non-nuclear weapon countries to remove the fissile material they need for the submarine reactors from the stockpile monitored by the IAEA. With concerns that the first Australian-built nuclear-powered submarines may not be ready until about 2040, there has been speculation that Australia could seek to buy the first couple of boats from offshore. Austin promised in December that the US would not allow Australia to have a capability gap between the retirement of its existing Collins class conventional fleet and the entry into service of new nuclear-powered submarines. That has prompted a vigorous debate within US politics about how to help Australia in the short to medium term without undermining its own submarine needs. Democratic senator Jack Reed, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and then-Republican senator James Inhofe wrote to Biden in December to implore him not to stress “the US submarine industrial base to the breaking point”. A subsequent bipartisan letter coordinated by the Democratic representative Joe Courtney said the US would gain from providing “our closest ally with an undersea capability to better posture itself in the region”. Courtney’s grouping said while it was essential for the US to stick to its own plan to build a minimum of two submarines a year to meet its requirements, “we are supportive of expanding the industrial base to meet Aukus expectations”. There is renewed speculation the three countries might work on a shared future submarine model, after the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the options included “the sharing of technology and the understanding of how to do it, the sharing of the build, or the sharing of the design”. Marles and the Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, joined their British counterparts Wallace and James Cleverly for annual high-level talks in the UK on Thursday, with Aukus one of the key topics on the agenda. At their joint press conference in Portsmouth on Thursday, Marles said: “This is a huge moment in our country’s history. This will change Australia’s international personality. It will dramatically build our capability and with that it will build our sovereignty.” In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which was signed by Biden in late December, the US Congress requested Austin to order an independent assessment of the “challenges” to implementing Aukus. The assessment would examine “alternatives that would significantly accelerate Australia’s national security”. Interim options could include “leasing or conveyance of legacy United States submarines for Australia’s use” or the supply of B-21 bombers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2023/mar/14/ruthless-chris-hipkins-backpedals-on-climate-action-as-new-zealand-elections-near","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T01:38:47Z","webTitle":"Ruthless Chris Hipkins backpedals on climate action as New Zealand elections near | Henry Cooke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/mar/14/ruthless-chris-hipkins-backpedals-on-climate-action-as-new-zealand-elections-near","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2023/mar/14/ruthless-chris-hipkins-backpedals-on-climate-action-as-new-zealand-elections-near","fields":{"bodyText":"Chris Hipkins loves to cycle. New Zealand’s newish prime minister, who stepped into the job after Jacinda Ardern’s shock resignation earlier this year, has been pedalling the 30km from his home in Upper Hutt to parliament for years. It’s not a particularly safe route, with many sections where Hipkins would be riding right alongside 100kmh traffic. It’s this kind of danger that stops cycle commuting from being particularly mainstream – just 2% commuted by bike at the last census – but this is far from a political priority for Hipkins. He loves to cycle, but the main thing he wants to do is win. This intense drive towards victory is crucial to understanding why Hipkins has spent the last month ditching many sections of his government’s climate change policy, all in the aftermath of two major storms which were likely worse because of climate change. It explains why a government that happily tells other nations to stop subsidising fossil fuels is once again extending a tax cut on petrol and diesel. It’s why Hipkins on Monday ditched not just expensive climate policies like the “cash for clunkers” scrappage scheme, but also the drive to lower speed limits in many parts of the country to increase road safety. It’s not that the government couldn’t lower speeds and fix storm-damaged roads at the same time – our transport agency has around 2,400 staff – it’s that Hipkins doesn’t want to talk about lowering the speed limit. He doesn’t want to talk about spending a small amount of money on bike lanes or a media merger or votes for 16-year-olds, and he doesn’t want the media talking about it either. The money is immaterial; the conversation is not. This message discipline is ruthless enough that Hipkins is willing to ditch policies his colleagues have spent months or years on, all for emptier column inches. He’s betting that the flurry of headlines about the government getting rid of any policies that don’t have to do with what he calls “bread and butter issues” will win him votes. And it seems to be working. Hipkins has climbed in the preferred prime ministerial stakes in recent polls, and Labour is now solidly back in contention for this year’s election. Hipkins would argue that the climate is far better served by Labour winning the election than a National-Act coalition. After all, the Act party has flirted with outright denialism within living memory, while National gutted the Emissions Trading Scheme while last in government, and remains committed to reopening offshore drilling for oil and gas. But Labour cannot simply delete policies until it is in government for ever. Presumably at the election this year it will have to have some actual policies to address the fact that New Zealand’s reliance on cars and cows mean we have quite high per-capita emissions and no easy path to bringing those down, given the easier job of decarbonising our electricity generation is largely already finished. If Labour doesn’t have those policies to talk about then the Green party, which it will need to form a government, will happily fill the void. Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the climate change minister, told this columnist Hipkins’ repeated backdowns on climate policy were “disappointing and making things harder”. “Individually none of these policies actually add up to much – but the cumulative effect is starting to add up. We’re running out of easy options. It’s getting very difficult to find options that we haven’t already exhausted,” Shaw said. Shaw rebuffs those who want the government to simply ditch various climate policies and focus exclusively on pricing carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme, saying the necessary price would be politically impossible. He notes that the recent surge in electric vehicle sales brought on by the government’s feebate scheme would have required an emissions price of about $500 a tonne – a price that “would result in the closure of all our heavy industry and eye-watering fuel prices for those who aren’t able to get an electric car.” Hipkins’ desertion of the field will probably benefit Shaw in the short term. The Greens can soak up climate conscious votes while Hipkins takes more of the centre-ground. But really big bold policy changes in New Zealand generally require one of the main two parties. That’s why Ardern’s “nuclear-free” line had such staying power – because it recalled a time when Labour was willing to take a big bold stance and fight with the rest of the world over it. Now the party just wants to backpedal.

The four units at one of Queensland’s largest generators, the failure-prone Callide power station near Biloela, were all offline after a series of incidents last week. At a press conference on Sunday, de Brenni addressed concerns about power supply shortages, which had been raised by the Mining and Energy Union (MEU) and others. Those worries were compounded by partial shutdowns and maintenance works at other Queensland generators. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The minister said the transmission system operator, Powerlink, had advised that the state had more than twice the amount of electricity supply needed to meet current demand. “We have a strong publicly owned and resilient system,” he said. “We’re very confident moving forward that we’ll have adequate supply. There’s no need for an emergency response.” The shutdown of Callide has reignited debate about the immediate future of coal-fired power stations. Some, like the Institute of Public Affairs, said that “likely blackouts and load-shedding” had “exposed the consequences” of removing coal-fired power stations from the national energy market. The Queensland Conservation Council said coal was increasingly unreliable and that renewables supported the energy system when coal power stations were offline. The council said the latest problem at Callide was evidence of the need to close coal stations and hasten the shift to renewables. Callide has been running at reduced capacity since an explosion and fire last year caused major damage to one of its four generators. That generator was one of two at “Callide C” built in 2001 and is one of the country’s youngest coal-fired generators. In 2020, Callide C broke down eight times. On Sunday, de Brenni said Callide was “old fashioned” and that “you wouldn’t build infrastructure like this going forward”. “That’s why we’re investing in new renewables, wind and solar,” he said. “The energy system of the future is not about old-fashioned, hard-to-maintain equipment, it’s about new technology.” The state government’s long-term energy plan, announced earlier this year, envisages transforming coal-fired power station sites like Callide into renewables hubs from about 2027. It also offered a jobs guarantee for energy-sector workers affected by the transition. Clare Silcock, an energy strategist with the Queensland Conservation Council, said the energy grid’s reliance on coal-fired power would create problems if power stations were offline during periods of peak demand. “It puts us in a pretty intense position for this summer, because we don’t have the investment in renewables and storage in place yet,” she said. “We could have more than 1o summers like this, where unreliable coal-fired power stations are offline. The only way to get out of the situation is to transition to renewables”. The MEU Queensland vice-president, Mike Brunker, released a statement last week saying the breakdown at Callide confirmed workers’ “fears that that investment in maintenance of the power station has been neglected in the race to shut down coal power and move to renewables”. “We need the Queensland government to step in and ensure Callide is being responsibly managed and maintenance and repair is prioritised – not only to get the power station back up and running but to keep it operating safely in the years ahead. “The focus should be on investing in the existing fleet and exploring opportunities to improve them rather than running them down.” De Brenni said the government supported the state’s power generation workforce and that he was confident engineers would have Callide operating safely “as soon as possible”. “[They have] done a stellar job of maintaining that plant and they’ll continue to do that,” he said. “We take our responsibility to manage our energy assets fully.” Callide is run by Queensland government-owned CS Energy. Its chief executive, Andrew Bills, has said the “immediate focus is to work methodically and safely to restore these units to service as quickly as possible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/04/labor-warns-nsw-facing-a-momentous-task-in-transition-to-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-04T08:27:13Z","webTitle":"Labor warns NSW facing a ‘momentous task’ in transition to renewables ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/04/labor-warns-nsw-facing-a-momentous-task-in-transition-to-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/04/labor-warns-nsw-facing-a-momentous-task-in-transition-to-renewables","fields":{"bodyText":"New South Wales faces a “momentous task” to decarbonise its electricity sector and will need to accelerate the state’s transition to renewables, the new energy minister, Penny Sharpe, has said. The electricity infrastructure roadmap, inherited from the previous Coalition government, aims to drive 12 gigawatts of new renewable generation and 2GW of long-duration storage into the grid by 2030. The plan’s first tender secured 1.4GW of new capacity at record low minimum prices, the government said earlier this week. “We’re trying to undertake a momentous task in the shortest period of time that’s ever been asked for us to do it,” Sharpe told the Smart Energy Council conference in Sydney on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Four of NSW’s five coal-fired power plants are scheduled to retire over the next 11 years in a state that sources 70% of its energy from non-renewable sources, she said. “The infrastructure to replace the coal-fired power stations in the past would have taken around 30 years, I’m told, to build,” Sharpe said. “We’re trying to do it in 15.” Last month’s closure of AGL Energy’s Liddell power station and Wednesday’s confirmation that Snowy Hydro’s 2.0 giant pumped hydro project has been delayed at least two years until possibly the end of 2029, have intensified calls for NSW to keep Origin Energy’s 2880MW Eraring power station beyond its scheduled closure date of August 2025. “‘The key thing is we just can’t turn [Eraring] off if the replacement [capacity] is not there,” Sharpe said on the sidelines of the conference. “We can’t have a situation where households and businesses and industries don’t have access to energy.” Sharpe and other officials have met executives from Origin and also the Canadian asset manager, Brookfield, that is in the process of trying to acquire Origin. To quicken the roll-out of renewables, the government will have to remove or reduce impediments across the government, including planning, skills and training, and inform communities affected by new plants and transmission lines more openly. “We need to find ways for them to feel as though the benefits will work for them,” Sharpe said. There will also be “the need adequate compensation for affected landholders”. “Our ambition is high,” Sharpe said. “We want NSW to be the world leader.” Other changes will include transition authorities to assist regions that will be losing fossil fuel-related employment, potentially complementing a national equivalent planned by the federal government. The Labor government also plans to legislate the state’s emissions reductions targets, including the 2050 net zero goal. An independent net zero commission, as promised in the election campaign, will also be set up “to keep the NSW government honest”, Sharpe said. To help provide relief to cope with soaring power bills in the near term, the government will provide $485m, to be matched by Canberra, to 1.6 eligible households and more than 300,000 eligible small businesses in the coming year. “I want every person, every household, every business, every community to be supported through what will sometimes be a bumpy transformation,” Sharpe said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/24/scotland-to-earn-260m-from-floating-windfarms-powering-north-sea-rigs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-24T14:59:41Z","webTitle":"Scotland to earn £260m from floating windfarms powering North Sea rigs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/24/scotland-to-earn-260m-from-floating-windfarms-powering-north-sea-rigs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/24/scotland-to-earn-260m-from-floating-windfarms-powering-north-sea-rigs","fields":{"bodyText":"The Scottish government will earn more than £260m after agreeing to lease areas of its seabed to floating offshore wind projects that can power oil and gas rigs. In a world first, Crown Estate Scotland gave the green light for companies to help trim the North Sea’s carbon emissions by developing floating windfarms that can directly supply oil and gas platforms with renewable electricity. Eight companies, which include the UK-listed oil firm Harbour Energy and an investment unit of the oil company BP, will pay a total of almost £262m in “applicant fees” once the agreements are finalised next year for the chance to build 13 offshore wind projects totalling 5.5GW. The leases were awarded to eight full-scale windfarm projects that plan to supply electricity directly to oil and gas platforms, as well as five small-scale wind power projects that will provide test beds for innovative new technologies that are not yet ready to be rolled out at scale. The crown estate expects to rake in further revenues for the Scottish government from “rent payments” once the windfarms begin operating for lifetimes, which could stretch to between 25 and 50 years. The North Sea oil industry is under pressure to cut its carbon emissions as the UK government continues to defy the anger of environmentalists by approving new oil and gas projects despite its legally binding climate targets. The Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the government on climate issues, has said that the UK carbon budgets can still be met if new UK fields are developed, provided that additional actions are taken to reduce emissions, such as electrifying offshore platforms with renewable energy. “However, there is also a wider question: whether developing new UK fields would help or hinder efforts to reduce emissions globally,” said the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, in a letter to the government last year. Oil companies are turning to floating offshore wind technology to replace the gas and diesel generators that usually power their rigs because these turbines can generate electricity even in very deep areas of the UK Continental Shelf where traditional windfarms could not be built. Colin Palmer, a director at Crown Estate Scotland, said the leasing round would help to reduce North Sea carbon emissions, generate revenues for the Scottish government and encourage innovation in the offshore renewables market. Brian McFarlane, an industry co-chair of the Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council, added that by using “Scottish deep-sea expertise built up over many years” would give the industry the opportunity “to show the world how to successfully build and operate floating offshore wind sites”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/06/how-would-three-hour-power-cuts-work-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T16:17:09Z","webTitle":"How would three-hour power cuts work if enacted in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/06/how-would-three-hour-power-cuts-work-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/06/how-would-three-hour-power-cuts-work-great-britain","fields":{"bodyText":"People in England, Scotland and Wales are braced for the possibility of rolling power cuts this winter after a warning on Thursday from National Grid. The electricity and gas system operator has said households could face a series of three-hour power cuts if Vladimir Putin shuts off gas supplies from Russia, and Britain experiences a cold snap akin to 2018’s “beast from the east”. Although National Grid has labelled the scenario “unlikely”, the emergency plan has prompted memories of persistent power outages in the 1970s and brought into focus the process by which people are cut off. What is rota disconnection? The system of rota disconnection, or rota load-shedding, is designed to equally share out the available power in a country or region through strategic shutdowns. In Great Britain, consumers in different parts of the country would be notified a day in advance of a three-hour block of time during which they would lose power. Households in different areas would then be cut off at different times or days, with the frequency rising depending on the severity of the supply shortage. The process is in legislation under the Electricity Supply Emergency Code. How would it work? There are 14 licensed areas of the country; within these, there are smaller areas on different circuits that have a timetable for cutoffs. The aim is to reduce power usage by about 5% through the three-hour disconnections. Consumers would typically be notified with a text message, similar to when there is a planned outage for maintenance work. An emergency public information campaign by National Grid and the government would be deployed across radio, billboards and social media platforms to urge people to use less energy. Liz Truss has so far resisted calls to ask people to use less energy. What has to happen for cutoffs to be introduced? The starting principle in the energy industry is to avoid disruption to consumers as long as it is safe to do so. With this in mind, the business department has spent months discussing usage with businesses, including large manufacturers, which use a lot of energy, about how to change their shift patterns away from times of peak demand. Households are now involved too, through a new “demand flexibility service”, which incentivises consumers not to turn on appliances when demand is high, such as during early evenings. However, if demand is still stretched after this intervention, and standby coal plants have been fired up, then consumers may start to experience “brownouts”, in which the electrical voltage drops. For households, that means lights may flicker more. At that point, rota disconnection could be employed. Why would the King be involved? Arcane legislation shows that the process cannot be enacted until the monarch gives their approval. An order in council would need to be approved by King Charles, taken on the advice of his privy council, after a recommendation by the business secretary. Who would be prioritised? Businesses can apply for protected site status to avoid disconnection. Certain manufacturers, such as steel plants where coal-fired blastfurnaces run constantly, are already exempt if shutdowns for three-hour periods would cause “significant financial damage”. Other designated sites with exemptions include hospitals, oil refineries, gas terminals, electricity generators, water treatment plants, armed forces bases and telecoms sites. Transport would be supported too, with airports, railways and ports allowed to run smoothly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jun/30/uk-coal-power-station-uniper-seeks-aid-from-german-government","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-30T16:37:16Z","webTitle":"UK power stations owner seeks German state aid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/30/uk-coal-power-station-uniper-seeks-aid-from-german-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jun/30/uk-coal-power-station-uniper-seeks-aid-from-german-government","fields":{"bodyText":"The owner of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire is in talks with the German government to secure emergency state support after Russia slashed its gas supplies. Uniper has issued a profit warning and is discussing “stabilisation measures” with German officials after Russia’s Gazprom delivered just 40% of the gas it had ordered. The German group said it expected its earnings to be significantly below previous years as a result. Its shares plunged nearly 20% in response. Russia has been limiting gas supplies to western Europe since the start of the war in Ukraine. Energy firms on the continent have dashed to fill up gas storage facilities before the winter fearing supplies will be completely cut off. Germany last week triggered the second stage of a national gas emergency plan that could lead to rationing if shortages continue. Uniper said government support could include “equity investments” and an expansion of a €2bn credit facility with a state bank agreed earlier this year as the energy crisis ramped up. John Musk, an RBC Europe analyst, said other European utility companies with gas supply exposure – including E.ON, RWE, Enel and Engie – could also be negatively affected by the situation. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: “[Uniper] has been forced to buy energy in the market after Gazprom delivered less than half of its contractually committed volumes of gas over the past fortnight. “Uniper is in a pickle as it can’t yet pass on these higher costs, so there is significant financial pressure on the business.” Shares in Uniper, which is worth nearly €5bn, are down 67% so far this year. Uniper owns the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station as well as a string of UK gas plants. Britain has access to significant quantities of gas from the North Sea and Norway. This week it emerged that the National Grid had drawn up emergency measures, including cutting off supplies into Europe. The government is in talks to extend the life of one of the coal-fired units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar to shore up energy supplies during winter. George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said the energy rationing would increase the risk of a recession in Germany. “If the gas shutoff is not resolved in [the] coming weeks, we worry this will lead to a broadening out of energy disruption with material upfront effects on economic growth, and of course much higher inflation,” he added. There are fears that a sudden shutdown in Russian gas supplies would lead to further increases in already sky-high consumer bills. The Aurora Energy Research consultancy estimated that if supplies were brought to an immediate halt, the UK annual energy price cap for this winter would rise to £3,100. It is currently £1,971 and is expected to exceed £2800 from October, excluding the £400 government discount pledged by the chancellor ,Rishi Sunak. Aurora estimated that a complete halt to Russian natural gas to Europe as soon as July would drive European gas prices 68% higher by this winter, and that wholesale prices in the UK would be 38% higher than pre-war forecasts on average over the next five years. Earlier this month, Gazprom cut supplies through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, citing the delayed return of equipment being serviced in Canada by the German company Siemens Energy. The delay to its return was reportedly due to Canadian sanctions, and the government in Ottawa has said it is attempting to resolve the issue. Separately, the Nord Stream pipeline is due to shut for 10 days from 11 July for maintenance work, raising the prospect of a further supply squeeze. Germany has said 60% of its gas storage facilities are full but that the remaining 30% necessary to hit a November target cannot be achieved without extra measures if the low levels of Russian gas supplies continue. Germany has also restarted its coal-fired plants to preserve natural gas. Separately on Thursday, Gazprom cancelled its dividend for the first time since 1998. The state-backed company said its investors had blocked plans to make a large payout for 2021 at its annual meeting. The Russian state owns 38% of the energy supplier, with other state companies owning a further 12%. The dividend decision sent its shares plummeting by 25%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/07/mar-a-lago-trump-nuclear-documents-spies","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T18:25:35Z","webTitle":"Mar-a-Lago a magnet for spies, officials warn after nuclear file reportedly found","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/07/mar-a-lago-trump-nuclear-documents-spies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/07/mar-a-lago-trump-nuclear-documents-spies","fields":{"bodyText":"Mar-a-Lago – the Palm Beach resort and residence where Donald Trump reportedly stored nuclear secrets among a trove of highly classified documents for 18 months since leaving the White House – is a magnet for foreign spies, former intelligence officials have warned. The Washington Post reported that a document describing an unspecified foreign government’s defences, including its nuclear capabilities, was one of the many highly secret papers Trump took away from the White House when he left office in January 2021. There were also documents marked SAP, for Special-Access Programmes, which are often about US intelligence operations and whose circulation is severely restricted, even among administration officials with top security clearance. Potentially most disturbing of all, there were papers stamped HCS, Humint Control Systems, involving human intelligence gathered from agents in enemy countries, whose lives would be in danger if their identities were compromised. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is conducting a damage assessment review which is focused on the sensitivity of the documents, but US officials said it is the job of FBI counter-intelligence to assess who may have gained access to them. That is a wide field. The home of a former president with a history of being enthralled by foreign autocrats, distrustful of US security services, and boastful about his knowledge of secrets, is an obvious foreign intelligence target. “I know that national security professionals inside government, my former colleagues, [they] are shaking their heads at what damage might have been done,” John Brennan, former CIA director, told MSNBC. “I’m sure Mar-a-Lago was being targeted by Russian intelligence and other intelligence services over the course of the last 18 or 20 months, and if they were able to get individuals into that facility, and access those rooms where those documents were and made copies of those documents, that’s what they would do.” Last month, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported that a Russian-speaking immigrant from Ukraine was able to mingle with the former president’s family and friends at Mar-a-Lago, posing as Anna de Rothschild, presenting herself as being an heiress of the banking dynasty. Inna Yashchyshyn, the daughter of a truck driver who moved to Canada, regaled those around her with tales of vineyards and estates and growing up in Monaco, and even met the former president in person, getting herself photographed with him on a golfing green. There is no evidence that Yashchyshyn was a spy, but the episode underlined how easy it is to get into Mar-a-Lago. During Trump’s presidency, two Chinese women were caught trespassing there on separate occasions. One of them, Yujing Zhang, was in possession of four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive, and a thumb drive later found to carry malware. In her hotel room, investigators found nine USB drives, five SIM cards and a “signal detector” device for spotting hidden microphones or cameras. She was found guilty of unlawfully entering a restricted building and making false statements to a federal officer, and deported to China in 2021. The guests, invited or otherwise, are not the only security concern. In 2021, the Trump Organization sought 87 foreign workers for positions at Mar-a-Lago, with wages starting at $11.96 an hour. “Any competent foreign intelligence service, whether those belonging to China, those belonging to Iran, to Cuba, certainly including Russia are … and were interested in gaining access to Mar-a-Lago,” Peter Strzok, former deputy assistant director of counter-intelligence at the FBI, told MSNBC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2022/oct/06/detroit-power-outages-impact-minority-low-income-neighborhoods","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"‘Utility redlining’: Detroit power outages disproportionally hit minority and low-income areas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/oct/06/detroit-power-outages-impact-minority-low-income-neighborhoods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2022/oct/06/detroit-power-outages-impact-minority-low-income-neighborhoods","fields":{"bodyText":"In late August, strong thunderstorms rolled through metro Detroit, knocking out power for six days at Marlene Harris-Bady’s Highland Park home. It was the second long outage that month in the largely low-income neighborhood, and Harris-Bady said she and her husband endure similar outages about five times annually. “It’s always a big mess and this has been going on for years,” Harris-Bady said, adding that DTE Energy, the private utility serving the area, always tells her the problem is with a nearby transformer. A few miles away, in a wealthier suburb, Harris-Bady’s sister lost power during the August storm for only a few hours, and rarely endures long outages. A new report proposes an explanation: DTE has generally disinvested in low-income and minority neighborhoods, and spends more resources on improving service in whiter, wealthier areas. The type of power delivery system DTE most often operates in the region’s low-income and minority neighborhoods is antiquated, and equipment like poles and transformers in these areas are generally much older and beyond their expected life. The policy brief, written by Michigan consumer advocates with data gleaned from regulatory hearings, characterizes the situation as “utility redlining”. “DTE predominantly underserves an area that has higher percentages of Bipoc and people experiencing poverty,” the brief, co-written by We the People Michigan and Soulardarity. “It’s a textbook example of an inequitable electric distribution system.” DTE faces ongoing criticism over frequent and long outages in Detroit caused by an aging grid and strong storms that occur more often as the climate changes. Federal data from 2019, the most recent year available, shows Michigan customers experienced the fourth longest average duration of outages, and DTE ranks among the worst utilities in the metric in Michigan. Though state regulators have asked DTE for more granular data that would show outage frequency and duration in areas served by the two systems, it has not yet been publicly released. In a statement to the Guardian, the company highlighted recent upgrades and maintenance, like tree trimming, that it says have reduced the number of outages in Detroit. A spokesperson also pointed to several wealthier, whiter cities served by the older system, and noted plans to upgrade its entire service area to the newer system, though it didn’t provide a timeline. Throughout the DTE service area, wealthier and whiter communities are most often served by 13.2kV lines, while lower-income and minority communities are generally served by a 4.8kV system installed over 60 years ago. The newer systems are much more resilient and capable of weathering a storm without widespread, long outages because they have about three times as much voltage capacity, according to industry literature. When an outage occurs, the newer system enables utilities to restore service faster by rerouting customers to an adjacent circuit without making repairs, and the newer system provides more circuits. The newer systems also integrate advanced technology that helps improve service with solar, storage and electric vehicle charging stations. Minority customers largely do not get those benefits, the report finds. About 90% of residents served by the older system in Detroit are minorities, as are about 24% outside of the city. Only about 21% of those served by DTE’s newer system are minorities. Similarly, residents living below the poverty line comprise about 38% of DTE customers served by the older system inside Detroit and 15% outside Detroit. Only about 10% of customers served by the newer system live beneath the poverty line. DTE and utilities around the country generally invest in areas where there is economic growth, an approach that favors wealthier, whiter suburbs. The company has said in regulatory hearings that it does not consider race or income when making improvements, said Jackson Koeppel, a co-author of the brief and independent consultant for Soulardarity. “We know that race- and income-blind policies are self-fulfilling prophecies that will keep poor and non-white communities underdeveloped,” he said. The report also looked at the age of the utilities’ infrastructure, including substations, switchgear, poles, cables and transformers, and found all except poles were beyond their industry expected life in older areas. Substations have an industry life expectancy of 45 years, while the average age in DTE’s newer system is 32 years compared with 53 years in its older system. Cables in the utility’s older system average 64 years compared with 25 years in the newer system, while the average industry life expectancy is 25 years. The Michigan Public Services Commission, which regulates private utilities in the state, has said it is clear DTE’s service is worse in areas with older systems. “Communities served by [the older system] are plagued by the highest trouble in the DTE electric system, yet the very system that causes the increased trouble is also the one that limits their ability to seek solutions,” Joy Wang, a staff member with the commission, said during a recent regulatory hearing. DTE told the Guardian it plans to convert all of its 4.8kV systems to 13.2kV, and noted that half of that work is planned for Detroit. But the work that has begun and is planned for the coming years is in greater downtown Detroit, which holds the city’s highest concentration of wealthy and white residents. Improvements are also planned for areas where large industrial customers operate. Some are also calling for the utility to take simple, cost-effective steps like implementing software that allows utilities to flag weak points in the grid system before they cause an outage. Consumer advocates have called for regulators to order DTE’s shareholders to take the financial hit to improve the grid. DTE is a “regulated monopoly”, meaning customers in its service area have to buy power from it. But regulators can order the utility to make improvements, and set the return on equity for its Wall Street shareholders. So far, the company and its shareholders largely have not faced financial consequences, Koeppel said. “If there’s no connection between performance and profits, then DTE is going to keep making profits without improving performance,” he said. For now, that financial burden falls on residents like Harris-Bady. She and her husband have purchased a generator to protect against outages. They’ve lost food, and a surge during the August storm destroyed their stove. When they lose heat in the winter, they have to stay in hotel rooms, and having the lights out in a high crime area creates a safety risk, Harris-Bady said. She estimates outages have cost them at least $10,000 in expenses. They have received only a $25 credit from the utility for their trouble over the years. “We’re not just complaining – we’re spending money to try to fix it on our own,” said Shawn Bady, Marlene Harris-Bady’s husband. “We’ve done preventive maintenance to make sure these things don’t happen, but it’s out of our control.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T14:06:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 400 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"A Moscow court has formally arrested a reporter for the Wall Street Journal in relation to espionage allegations, according to Russian law enforcement agencies. Russia’s top security agency said Evan Gershkovich was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Ekaterinburg while allegedly trying to obtain classified information. The security service alleged that Gershkovich “was collecting classified information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex.” The Wall Street Journal “vehemently denies” allegations of espionage against Gershkovich, the newspaper said in a statement. The Moscow court has ordered Gershkovich should be held in pre-trial custody for nearly two months until 29 May, according to a court document. Gershkovich told the court that he was not guilty of espionage, state-run Tass news agency is reporting. A lawyer representing Gershkovich was not allowed to attend the hearing, according to Tass. Russian forces have had some success in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday evening, adding that their fighters were still holding on in a battle that has lasted several months. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War’s regular update appears to support this, saying, “geolocated footage published on March 28 and 29 indicates that Russian forces advanced in southern and southwestern Bakhmut.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow will continue to give the US advance notice about its missile tests despite suspending participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty, reversing a statement he made on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Alexei Moskalyov, a Russian man who was sentenced to two years in prison for discrediting the Russian armed forces, and whose daughter was taken into care, has been detained after fleeing house arrest, human rights activist and lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said on Thursday. It was earlier reported that Moskalyov was arrested in Minsk in Belarus, having fled his house arrest. The UK Ministry of Defence reports, citing Russian media, that authorities are preparing to launch a major recruitment campaign aimed at signing up 400,000 new troops to fight in Ukraine. Ukrainian volunteers who have been evacuating civilians from the frontlines of the war with Russia say some parents have been hiding their children in basements to prevent them from being taken. While parents have given different reasons, most volunteers have attributed the phenomenon to a combination of poverty and the psychological condition of the families, who have been living under bombing for months. European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski would support curbs on trading with Ukraine if Poland proposed such a solution, he said on Thursday, amid anger from farmers over the effect of Ukrainian imports on grain prices. Lawmakers from the pro-Russia, far-right Freedom Party walked out of the lower house of Austria’s parliament on Thursday during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, protesting that it violated Austria’s neutrality. Austria says its neutrality prevents it from military involvement in the conflict and while it supports Ukraine politically it cannot send the country weapons in its fight against the Russian invasion. The Freedom Party (FPÖ) had warned days before that it would hold some form of protest against the address. Four bankers who helped a close friend of Vladimir Putin move millions of francs through Swiss bank accounts have been convicted of lacking diligence in financial transactions. The four were found guilty on Thursday of helping Sergey Roldugin, a concert cellist who has been dubbed “Putin’s wallet” by the Swiss government. China said its military was willing to work together with the Russian military to strengthen strategic communication and coordination. Dymtro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has criticised the fact that Russia will take over chairing the UN security council on 1 April, describing it as a “bad joke”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to attend the Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on 3 April to 5 April. He will meet Kuleba, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. King Charles III lauded the current unity between the UK and Germany in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying “the scourge of war is back in Europe”. The king said both the UK and Germany had shown “vital leadership” and praised Berlin’s decision to provide large military support to Ukraine as “remarkably courageous, important and appreciated”. Criticism by some European governments – including Ukraine’s – of a plan for a full return of Russian and Belarusian athletes to international sport is deplorable and cuts into the autonomy of sport, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, Thomas Bach, said on Thursday. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that Moscow was still talking to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the idea of a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has been controlled by Russian forces since March 2022. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, had made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine on Wednesday amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked.” Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/07/first-thing-fbi-found-document-on-foreign-nuclear-defenses-at-mar-a-lago-report","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T10:46:20Z","webTitle":"FBI found document on foreign nuclear defenses at Mar-a-Lago – report | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/07/first-thing-fbi-found-document-on-foreign-nuclear-defenses-at-mar-a-lago-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/07/first-thing-fbi-found-document-on-foreign-nuclear-defenses-at-mar-a-lago-report","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. A document describing a foreign government’s nuclear capabilities was recovered by the FBI during its search of Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post reported yesterday. The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, did not identify the government named in the document, which described the country’s military defenses. The content of the more than 11,000 government documents and photographs that FBI agents recovered from Donald Trump’s Florida estate last month has not been revealed, but previous reporting from the Post indicated classified documents about nuclear weapons were among the items federal authorities were looking for. Some of the documents seized from were typically closely guarded, the newspaper reported, and had “a designated control officer” to monitor their location. What was found in the documents? Among the records recovered by the FBI were documents detailing top-secret US operations that require special clearances “on a need-to-know basis”, beyond a top-secret clearance, according to the Post. Some of the Biden administration’s most senior national security officials were not authorized to review some of the documents because they were so restricted, the Post said. Why did a judge grant Trump’s request for a “special master”? Critics say the decision to stop reviewing documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a special master is appointed is “unprecedented” and “insane”. California heatwave enters intense phase bringing blackouts and wildfires California’s power grid faces a major stress test on Tuesday, as a record heatwave enters its most brutal phase. With temperatures in parts of the state predicted to hit 115F (46C), officials are asking residents to prepare for possible rolling blackouts. Controlled power interruptions could help maintain reliability and avoid cascading blackouts, as people across the state cranked up their air conditioners, California’s grid operator said. “We have now entered the most intense phase of this heatwave,” said Elliot Mainzer, the president of the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which runs the state’s electrical grid. “Forecasted demand for Monday and Tuesday is at all-time record levels and the potential for rotating outages has increased significantly.” Mainzer said the state’s power supply could fall more than 5,000MW short of its peak demand yesterday, predicted to be about 5.30pm. Demand could exceed 51,000MW – surpassing the record 50,270MW set in 2006. What’s going to happen? The California ISO is expected to request an elevated emergency alert, one step away from ordering rotating power outages. Losing power and access to fans and air conditioning could be disastrous for vulnerable populations, as well as for disabled residents using powered medical devices. Steve Bannon to be indicted on fresh fraud charges over border wall – sources Trump’s former top strategist Steve Bannon is expected to be indicted tomorrow on state fraud charges connected to his role in a fundraising scheme to build a border wall, according to two sources familiar with the matter, years after he received a presidential pardon in the federal case. The expected move by the Manhattan district attorney’s office was quietly communicated to Bannon in recent days, the sources said of the sealed indictment, and they indicated the state charges would probably mirror the federal case in which he was pardoned. Bannon and three others were charged in that case by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with falsely claiming that they would not take compensation in the private We Build the Wall fundraising effort to underwrite part of the construction of the wall on the US-Mexico border. The architect of Trump’s 2016 election campaign, and later White House adviser, was accused of taking more than $1m of donations to the campaign, which sought to secure funding for the completion of the border wall. Why doesn’t the pardon apply to this charge? Bannon received a last-minute pardon in the final days of the Trump administration that expunged the federal indictment. But presidential pardons do not apply to state-level charges.

But we’ve been watching the plates shift over five hectic days trailing Anthony Albanese through our region. But before we get to Albanese’s reset with the Chinese president on Tuesday night, it’s best we understand the high-powered preamble. Joe Biden met Xi Jinping in Bali on Monday. Here’s some quick context for that meeting. The US and China – led by a couple of presidents who have just consolidated their domestic political power – are locked and loaded in their competition for regional supremacy. Biden was very clear about that after Monday’s meeting with Xi. Strategic competition is fierce, and it’s here to stay. But Biden had a very clear objective when he met Xi at the G20. He was pursuing something close to reciprocal trust. Biden said he wanted he and Xi to maintain open lines of communication as insurance against a cataclysm. If Biden’s meaning isn’t clear, let me help. The US president wanted to be able to pick up the phone to Xi to avert a world war that could start because of an accident, or a stupid miscalculation. And he wanted Xi to be able to reciprocate. If that thought feels chilling, I’m sorry. But it’s the world as it is. From our vantage point in Bali, it’s very clear the world wants an off-ramp from danger, from living in a constant state of fight or flight. World leaders are doing their red carpet struts, kings and queens of their dominions, but they are locked in an extraordinary, anxious huddle here in the luxury beach resorts of a tropical paradise in Indonesia. This G20 meeting is orbiting around a terrible war in Europe, and China’s role as a facilitator of Russia. The northern hemisphere is preoccupied with that conflict. But Biden well understands the dangers bubbling in the Indo-Pacific. So does Indonesia, the summit hosts. So do Asean nations. So Biden is working the world as it is, at both ends. The gavotte of the heavyweights in Bali on Monday night was Biden’s first face-to-face discussion with Xi since he took the White House, and the diplomatic reset was a bit of summit season pageantry staged for the world. While the media coverage ramped up the first contact angle, Biden and Xi actually know each other well. Their relationship goes back many years. Australia’s prime minister is yet to build a relationship with his most powerful peer in the region, and that work began on Tuesday night, when Albanese had his first meeting with Xi. It’s a first step, but it’s an important one. Albanese has cemented peer relationships quickly since winning the May election. He’s travelled extensively and won plaudits for being empathetic and sensible, and for not being Scott Morrison – the Australian prime minister much of the world seems to want to forget. Albanese has built rapport with Australia’s key allies by seeking human connections. I don’t know whether transactional humanism cuts through with an implacable, dangerous, authoritarian Chinese president, but I suspect Albanese will start with that, because temperamentally, that’s his thing. Biden, who has some of Albanese’s personality traits, signals differently on the world stage. Superpower diplomacy has to be aggressively simple, understood from the dress circle to the cheap seats. Albanese’s objectives and the way he projects reflects our status as an energetic regional middle power squeezed between our most important security and our largest trading partner. Aspirational. Not uppity. Quieter. Albanese was asked before Tuesday night’s meeting to articulate Australia’s objectives. They were modest. He was seeking “an improvement in the relationship”. Asked what success would look like, Albanese said: “Having the meeting is a successful outcome, because for six years, we have not had any dialogue”. The modest-sounding dot points belie the extreme complexity of this exercise. Once upon a time, Australian prime ministers used to pretend we wouldn’t “take sides” when it came to our relationships with the US and China. “Taking sides” was universally disdained as the unsophisticated, binary thinking of hacks and plodders. We are a long way away from that time now, and the reality is Australia has always had a side, even when we claimed we wouldn’t take one. China’s sharp elbows has made our choice explicit. As John Curtin said in 1941, Australia looks to America. As long as Biden and his rational presidential successors can hoist their democracy out of the post-truth bin fire, and keep it safe from the posturing proto-fascists who would destroy it, Australia will look to America. But that doesn’t mean Australia’s objectives with the China relationship are a facsimile of US objectives. There are differences, mostly expressed in the abstruse nuances of diplomacy, but these differences are actually substantial. Albanese lives in this region. Biden visits it. Australia seeks its security in this region, not from it, while Biden scans across the Pacific from afar. While the US asserts itself as the pre-eminent regional power, with all the trappings and status of pater familias, Labor’s tone in the region reflects our status, and our values. Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong is a child of the region, genetically and intellectually. A core doctrine in the new Labor government’s foreign policy has been to facilitate a sense of agency for our most important near neighbours. As she’s lapped south-east Asia and Pacific nations over the past six months in one of the most consequential soft-power offensives Australia has mounted in recent times, Wong has posed the same rhetorical question over and over. What kind of region do we want to live in? She tells our neighbours things are scary, but we get to determine what happens next. We can influence the flow of history through the sum of our actions. We don’t have to sit mute while China and the US dictate how security and prosperity looks in this region. We can decide. We should decide. But the thing about decisions is everyone can make them. China will also make decisions based on its own interests. Don’t get me wrong. Tuesday night is a good first start. Xi’s language suggests he wants a reset grounded in “mutual respect”. China’s signalling on this point has been obvious for several months, even when studded with flaring bellicosity from the foreign ministry. And Albanese will ride that tiger with eyes wide open. But there are profound disagreements in this relationship. It’s hard to see how the differences of values and aspirations can be bridged. It’s important to be clear at this juncture. From Australia’s perspective, the point of Tuesday night’s reset isn’t chasing perfect unanimity. Australia is actually seeking something else – the capacity to disagree well with China, with the least amount of collateral damage. Tuesday night is certainly a diplomatic coup for Albanese, a coup for Wong. But when it comes to the crunch, hard power, and the capacity to wield it, determines outcomes. China is the rising hegemon; the region’s long shadow. This century is China’s. Australians know that because we are a neighbour of China’s. We live it. We breathe it. We don’t need to read about it in a G20 brief as we fly in for an international summit. In the long run, China will decide how it wants to treat an Australia bolted into the military complex of the US; an Australia that is actively, openly, unapologetically, repelling Beijing’s influence campaigns both domestically and regionally. It will be up to China to determine whether it can pursue a fruitful relationship with Australia when Australia has already picked the other side, and everyone knows that. Talking is good. Talking is always better than not talking. Talking can change the world. But durable detente, if it is to happen, is a reciprocity business. It always requires two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/27/cuban-missile-crisis-60-years-on-new-papers-reveal-how-close-the-world-came-to-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T05:22:19Z","webTitle":"Cuban missile crisis, 60 years on: new papers reveal how close the world came to nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/cuban-missile-crisis-60-years-on-new-papers-reveal-how-close-the-world-came-to-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/27/cuban-missile-crisis-60-years-on-new-papers-reveal-how-close-the-world-came-to-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"The commander of a nuclear-armed Soviet submarine panicked and came close to launching a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago, after being blinded and disoriented by aggressive US tactics, according to newly translated documents. Many nuclear historians agree that 27 October 1962, known as “Black Saturday”, was the closest the world came to nuclear catastrophe, as US forces enforced a blockade of Cuba to stop deliveries of Soviet missiles. On the same day a U-2 spy plane was shot down over the island, and another went missing over Siberia when the pilot lost his way. Six decades on from the “world’s most dangerous day”, last week’s revelation that a Russian warplane fired a missile near a British Rivet Joint surveillance plane over the Black Sea has once more heightened concerns that miscalculation or accident could trigger uncontrolled escalation. In October 1962, the US sent its anti-submarine forces to hunt down Soviet submarines trying to slip through the “quarantine” imposed on Cuba. The most perilous moment came when one of those submarines, B-59, was forced to surface late at night in the Sargasso Sea to recharge its batteries and found itself surrounded by US destroyers and anti-submarine planes circling overhead. In a newly translated account, one of the senior officers on board, Captain Second Class Vasily Arkhipov, described the scene. “Overflights by planes just 20-30 metres above the submarine’s conning tower, use of powerful searchlights, fire from automatic cannons (over 300 shells), dropping depth charges, cutting in front of the submarine by destroyers at a dangerously [small] distance, targeting guns at the submarine,” Arkhipov, the chief of staff of the 69th submarine brigade, recalled. In his account, first given in 1997 but published for the first time in English by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, the submarine’s commander, Valentin Savitsky, lost his nerve. Arkhipov said one of the US planes “turned on powerful searchlights and blinded the people on the bridge so that their eyes hurt”. “It was a shock,” he said. “The commander physically could not give any orders, could not even understand what was happening.” The risk was, Arkhipov added: “The commander could have instinctively, without contemplation ordered an ‘emergency dive’; then after submerging, the question whether the plane was shooting at the submarine or around it would not have come up in anybody’s head. That is war.” In his account, Arkhipov played down his role and how close the B-59 submarine commander, Savitsky, came to launching the submarine’s one nuclear-tipped torpedo. However, Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of the National Security Archive’s Russian programmes, interviewed another submarine commander from the same brigade, Ryurik Ketov, who said Savitsky was convinced they were under attack and that the war with the US had started. The commander panicked, calling for an “urgent dive” and for the number one torpedo with the nuclear warhead to be prepared. However, because the signalling officer was in the way, Savitsky could not immediately get down the narrow stairway through the conning tower, and during those few moments of hesitation, Arkhipov realised that the US forces were signalling rather than attacking, and deliberately firing off to the side of the submarine. “He called to Savitsky and said: ‘calm down, look they are signalling, not attacking, let’s signal back.’ Savitsky turned back, saw the situation, ordered the signalling officer to signal back,” Savranskaya said. She added that two other officers would have had to confirm any order from Savitsky before the nuclear torpedo could have been launched. Tom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, said the aggressive tactics used by the American submarine hunters contributed to the close shave. At a conference in Havana in 2002, John Peterson, a lieutenant on the USS Beale, the destroyer closest to the Russian submarine, said he and his crew resented their orders to use only practice depth charges, which just made a loud bang. So they stuffed hand grenades into toilet roll tubes which would hold the pin down for a couple of hundred metres before disintegrating, and causing the grenade to explode next to the submarine’s hull. The Russian signals intelligence officer on the B-59, Vadim Orlov, said the experience was like being inside an oil drum beaten by a sledgehammer. The officers and crew were already exhausted. They had sailed all the way from the Russian far north, in submarines that were not adapted for warm waters. Internal temperatures in the engine compartment rose to up to 65 degrees Celsius, with carbon dioxide levels several times normal, and there was very little drinking water, Arkhipov recalled. Saved ‘primarily because of luck’ The B-59 incident was just one of a cascade of crises that day. A U-2 went missing over Siberia when the pilot lost his bearings, blinded by the aurora borealis and misled by compass malfunction close to the north pole. Some F-102 interceptor jets were scrambled to protect the U-2, but the joint chiefs of staff who gave the order for their launch were not aware they had been armed with nuclear missiles as a matter of course once the alert level was raised to Defcon 2. Minutes later, the joint chiefs heard that another U-2 had been shot down over Cuba and assumed it was a deliberate escalation by Moscow. In fact, the order had been given independently by two Soviet generals in Cuba. The joint chiefs were also unaware that there were 80 nuclear warheads on the missiles already in Cuba when they gave their recommendation for the US to carry out airstrikes and then an invasion of Cuba. The recommendation was overruled by president John Kennedy, as negotiations with Soviet representatives, some of them in a Washington Chinese restaurant, were making progress, leading ultimately to the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba while US missiles were pulled back from Turkey. Tom Collina, the director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, a disarmament advocacy group, said Black Saturday “reminds us that the reason we’ve gotten out of things like that in the past is primarily because of luck”. “We had some good management, we had some good thinkers,” Collina, co-author of The Button, a book on the nuclear arms race, said. “But basically, we got lucky in the closest situations where we could have gotten involved in nuclear war.” In the incident over the Black Sea on 29 September this year, two Russian Su-27 fighter aircraft shadowed a Royal Air Force Rivet Joint electronic surveillance plane, and one of the Russian planes released a missile. The Russian air force investigated and claimed it was the result of a technical malfunction. British officials are not convinced it was an accident, but intercepted communications made clear that Russian ground controllers were shocked at what happened, suggesting that if it was a deliberate show of force it was the decision of the pilot, rather than an order from Moscow. The close encounter prompted an unscheduled visit to Washington on 18 October by the UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, to coordinate responses in the event of a miscalculation or accidental clash between Nato and Russian forces, and to ask for Washington’s agreement for the UK to restart Rivet Joint patrols with fighter escorts. Collina said the danger of disaster would remain as long as nuclear weapons were part of the military equation. “The lesson we should have learned in 1962 is that humans are fallible, and we should not combine crises with fallible humans with nuclear weapons,” Collina said. “Yet here we are again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T19:46:34Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Latham eyes NSW kingmaker role, new secret ministries discovery, gas shortage fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/morning-mail-latham-eyes-nsw-kingmaker-role-new-secret-ministries-discovery-gas-shortage-fear","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning, everyone.

The project involves considerable risk. Spanning three nations (each with multiple jurisdictions) over two or more decades, including the governments of multiple presidents and prime ministers in three countries. This seems inconceivably difficult on one level – were it not for the galvanising effects of: the rise of an increasingly authoritarian and adversarial China; the fallout from Brexit, which has helped focus UK government officials on finding new trading partners in the Indo-Pacific and new ways of validating the “special relationship” with the United States; advanced artificial intelligence, persistent satellite surveillance and drones, which make detection of diesel-electric submarines traversing long distances much easier (therefore making Australia’s existing submarines more vulnerable and less stealthy). The project risks consuming vast resources, distracting the Australian government and its Aukus partners from addressing pressing environmental and governance concerns in the Pacific and beyond. Australia, with a long history of struggling to reconcile its history (with its Anglosphere inclinations) with its geography (a sparsely populated island continent on the edge of Asia), has shown signs of being eager to be on good terms with south-east Asian and Pacific neighbours, but Aukus leaves less bandwidth for governments to respond to such issues. Recruiting, training and keeping a workforce with specialist skills in the fields of nuclear science (notably physics and engineering), coupled with a significant expansion in specialist trades, will stretch the ability of the already taxed Australian education sector. Having spent decades shifting from just-in-case to just-in-time supply chains, Australia is less resilient now than most realise. Existing capabilities exist to threaten and disrupt Australia’s numerous supply chain vulnerabilities. The nuclear propulsion submarine complicates a potential adversary’s planning options with the knowledge that they would not be able to act with impunity. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia has long had a fear of abandonment. In the first half of the 20th century Australia relied on British martial prowess to supplement its own (not inconsequential) military forces and, from 1942 onwards has relied more on the United States. In the 72 years since the signing of the Anzus treaty in 1951 (itself only an 800-word essay lacking mutual security guarantees) the ties that bind have deepened and broadened. For a boutique defence force like Australia’s, which proudly stresses its sovereignty, militarily it has become increasingly enmeshed and reliant on US systems – ironically enough with a view to bolster its own self-reliance. Beyond this already quite dependent level of integration with US forces and systems, Albanese has strenuously asserted that the Aukus submarine acquisition will not dilute Australian sovereignty. The calculus is that in the face of sanctions, wolf-warrior diplomacy, an increasingly authoritarian and pushy China that has been expanding its land, sea, air, cyber, space and strategic missile forces at an alarming rate, prudence dictates circumspect public engagement and a more muscular approach – speaking more softly and carrying a bigger stick. Some critics suggest the United States will eventually leave the Pacific or will be pushed out so we should be cautious about doubling down on our security ties. But its presence geographically is not temporary and its friends are more eager than ever for it to stay. Others point to domestic political uncertainty in the US. But even Trump as president doubled down on the alliance with Australia and made a concerted effort to reduce the prospect of war – including on the Korean peninsula. The view that America should back off defies the will of many in the region (notably Japan, Korea, the Philippines and many (albeit more quietly spoken) in south-east Asia and the Pacific. If anything, Aukus looks set to provide greater US resolve to stay engaged in Australia’s neighbourhood. Critics also suggest the submarines will only exacerbate tensions. I beg to differ. If handled with discretion and with neighbours treated respectfully and briefed in as best as possible, the new arrangements can be expected to bolster security and stability in the region, not undermine them. Weakness invites adventurism, it is said. This high-stakes and high-risk plan is about reducing the prospects of adventurism. Others say we will be dragged into a war over Taiwan. But what we want is the status quo maintained, not overturned. And it’s not just us. While most regional neighbours are reluctant to say so publicly, privately they are eager for the US presence to remain and for the status quo to continue. The best way to ensure that, in the face of a more assertive and muscular China, it appears, is to muscle up in response. Some would respond saying the US can’t be trusted. Look at Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. They miss the changed dynamics of today. American strategists have a clear-eyed appreciation of the diminution of American martial prowess and of the high risk of failure in any Indo-Pacific confrontation. The unduly cocky confidence of 2003 and 2011 is a thing of the past. In my estimation, the chastened Americans can be trusted to do the right thing, having “tried everything else”, as Winston Churchill once said.

The nuclear-powered submarine program is forecast to cost between $268bn and $368bn by the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period. Humanitarian and development organisations have pointed to this allocation as proof that “significant funds” are available if the government shows political will. In meetings with MPs from across the political spectrum in Canberra, the sector has stressed that Australia spends just $1 on aid for every $10 spent on defence. The Australian Council for International Development argues security is more likely to be assured when the different arms of statecraft – defence, diplomacy and development – are working together. It has noted that Australia remains near the bottom of the OECD ladder for foreign aid funding as a share of gross national income. Its member organisations, including ChildFund and UnitingWorld, are calling for “a balance of approaches” after the Aukus announcement. Margaret Sheehan, the chief executive of ChildFund, said: “Clearly, there are funds that are available and I suppose it’s about the way people choose to prioritise those funds.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sheehan said defence, diplomacy and development were interconnected. “We want to see a fair weighting – and Australians would say a fair go.” Sureka Goringe, the national director at UnitingWorld, said: “Development has a proven track record in making friends and influencing people, so we should use it. “This is not a ‘nice to have’ luxury. This is a core strategic investment for Australia.” The sector is asking the government to commit to a clear timetable for meeting a pledge to restore official development assistance to 0.5% of gross national income. To deal with more immediate crises, such as natural disasters and famine in the region and beyond, the sector also wants the government to double the $150m annual humanitarian emergency fund. “We’re seeing that the need is escalating through the impacts of Covid, the impact of conflict, particularly the war in Ukraine, and obviously, the climate crisis, which has no borders,” Goringe said. Faysel Ahmed Selat, the president of the Somali Community Association of Queensland, travelled to Canberra to support the Help Fight Famine campaign, which seeks a $110m famine prevention package focused on the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria. “What I can tell you is the Somali community in Australia … are going without and sending money to family members who would otherwise have nothing,” he told Guardian Australia. “We are suffering because of the loss of family members, grandparents, children, mothers, fathers, or we may be worried about their wellbeing.” Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, defence industry and the Pacific, has sought to assure the sector that the government is not focused only on hard power. Conroy said the government was “serious about putting development at the centre of how we do international engagement”. “When I talk to the leaders of the Department of Defence, they’re evangelical that hard power – acquiring nuclear submarines – has to be complemented with equal efforts on soft power, investing in diplomacy, investing in development,” he said. Conroy said members of the cabinet’s national security committee accepted that Australia faced “the greatest strategic uncertainty since 1945” and this compelled the government to invest in all elements of statecraft. He said that attitude was a big reason he and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, had secured “so much support” internally to increase development funding by $1.4bn over four years in the Albanese government’s first budget. Conroy said the government would “always look at opportunities to make sure that money is spent well and, where there are opportunities, to increase it”, but he added a word of caution about the budget. “We’re in a very tight fiscal environment at the moment, and we need to balance all those demands.” The increase to development funding announced last October came on top of a low base because of multibillion-dollar cuts made during the Coalition’s time in office. In 2021 Australia was ranked 21st out of 29 OECD donors for development assistance, delivering 0.22% of gross national income."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/02/could-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-ruin-minsmere-rspb-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-02T13:32:57Z","webTitle":"Could nuclear plant ruin Suffolk haven for avocets, bitterns and harriers?

More than a dozen birdwatchers were crammed into the elevated shelter which overlooks a broad band of heath, freshwater pools and reed beds stretching to the Suffolk coast. Marsh harriers swirled overhead and an occasional bittern swept across the landscape. In front of another nearby hide, avocets waded leisurely across a lagoon. Minsmere is an ornithologist’s paradise. But a threat hangs over its wildlife glories. In a few days, the government is set to announce its decision on whether to allow the Sizewell C nuclear power plant to be built by EDF on land that overlooks the 1,000-hectare (2,500-acre) reserve. Approval will trigger the go-ahead for one of Europe’s biggest construction projects, and the impact on the reserve will be intense. New roads and a temporary port may be built, and dozens of huge cranes erected across land that borders Minsmere. For at least a decade, construction of the giant plant’s twin nuclear reactors will proceed – day and night. “We are not opposed to the principle of there being energy infrastructure at the Sizewell site but the likely impact of this particular project could be very damaging,” said Adam Rowlands, Suffolk area manager for the RSPB. “There is a real threat to species that we have struggled to preserve here.” Minsmere, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, is rated as one of the UK’s finest wildlife reserves, though its origins are unusual. At the beginning of the second world war, it was decided the area’s low-lying farmland should be flooded as a protection against German invasion. After the war ended, it was discovered that avocets, which had been extinct in the UK for more than 100 years, had started nesting there. “At the time, there was all sorts of pressure being put on landowners to drain land and boost food production in the UK in the years after the war,” added Rowlands. “However, in the end it was decided to keep the area as a natural mix of shingle beaches, coastal lagoons, grazing marshes and woodland. The RSPB took this over in 1947. Essentially, the land was rewilded, long before the term became an ecological buzzword.” Many rare species, such as the marsh harrier and the bittern, found precious refuge at Minsmere. However, it was the return of the avocet that had the greatest impact. After a century’s absence from Britain, the black-and-white wader, with its distinctive up-curved beak, established a small colony at Minsmere. From there it spread slowly across the nation. Today, there are about 1,500 breeding pairs in the UK and the bird is now depicted in the RSPB’s emblem, a symbol of hope in the cause of saving threatened bird species. Nor are avocets, bitterns and marsh harriers the only Minsmere residents. Otters, water voles, kingfishers, nightjars, woodlarks, Dartford warblers, adders, natterjack toads and silver-studded blue butterflies have also made homes on the reserve. “It is the range of habitats that makes Minsmere special,” said Rowlands. “There are reed beds, wet grassland, ditches, coastal shingle, woodland, heather heathland and acid grassland. This is a precious space.” The prospect of a vast construction project proceeding on adjacent land, therefore, causes concerns. In Somerset, where EDF is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, about 1,600 workers are on site every day; 3m tonnes of concrete and 230,000 tonnes of steel will eventually be used to make the new power plant while the site is dominated by giant 40-metre (130ft) cranes. The construction of its twin at Sizewell C will be identical in scale. Sizewell C will also require vast amounts of water for its workers, and to make the concrete needed for its construction. It is not clear where this water will come from in an area where supplies are already stretched. After its completion, even greater amounts will be needed to cool its reactors. “There is also the issue of the warm water leaving the reactor,” said Rowlands. “That could have a significant impact on the marine environment on the coast at Minsmere, affecting the populations of fish and shellfish there and the birds that feed on them.” After nine years’ construction, Hinkley Point C is now two years behind schedule and £8bn over budget although EDF has argued that the lessons it is learning in constructing the Somerset plant will be crucial in keeping Sizewell C – which would provide electricity for 6m homes in Britain – on target in terms of cost and schedule. The company says it is already planting trees along its boundary with the reserve to protect Minsmere and it has also created 47 hectares of new habitats for foraging marsh harriers to the north of the construction site. “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity, and Sizewell will play a big role in tackling the carbon emissions that are driving that change,” said an EDF spokesperson. “We have to get to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, and – combined with Hinkley Point C and further nuclear projects – Sizewell C will play a key role in getting us there.” Nevertheless, the RSPB remains concerned about the likely impact on the reserve it considers to be a jewel in its crown. “There are plans to have a new port, a massive new road and a new rail line built into the land beside this reserve in order to construct Sizewell C,” said Rowlands. “That is going to make it very, very difficult for us to preserve an absolutely glorious region where people can observe some of Britain’s finest wildlife.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/24/how-our-cities-fall-prey-to-power-and-money","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-24T16:21:13Z","webTitle":"How our cities fall prey to power and money | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/24/how-our-cities-fall-prey-to-power-and-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/24/how-our-cities-fall-prey-to-power-and-money","fields":{"bodyText":"Aditya Chakrabortty’s well-researched exposé of how a rich and powerful actor has run rings around a naive and emasculated local authority is unfortunately par for the course (How a great English city sold itself to Abu Dhabi’s elite – and not even for a good price, 21 July). It may be a particularly egregious example given the UAE’s appalling record on human rights, but the root problem has been reproduced throughout the country. However, it’s not too late, and all is not necessarily lost. A substantial land value tax would return much of the relinquished benefit to the public purse, and therefore to the community that unwittingly gave it all away in perpetuity. It would also undermine the business model for this kind of pernicious, speculative project in the future and, by repairing the dysfunctional land market, invalidate the current infrastructure development modus operandi that works so well for the few and so poorly for the many. Anthony Molloy Labour Land Campaign • I share Aditya Chakrabortty’s concerns about the redevelopment of Manchester and the role of the city council, but would go further. The redevelopment of the city centre, dominated by hideous high-rise blocks, has damaged the whole cityscape. One looks to the French, who sensibly limited the height of buildings across the core of Paris. What may work at Salford Quays does not work within the city boundaries. The rot started in the 1960s and is epitomised by the hideous Piccadilly Plaza, in what is laughingly called Piccadilly Gardens, further deteriorating when the remaining gardens were themselves replaced by an office block and acres of concrete. As for the financial arrangements, there is a more general problem. Too often local councils refuse to reveal financial agreements and contracts on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. While this may suit the partners, it is clearly not in the public interest, and is a recurring source of incompetence and corruption in local authorities. National legislation needs to outlaw this practice. Dr Stephen Dearden New Mills, Derbyshire • Having read Aditya Chakrabortty’s article, I don’t think the blame lies just with the council. I used to work for a local authority finance department, trying to assess projects. After years of austerity cuts, staff were too stretched to be able to properly navigate and interrogate these deals. Also, by getting rid of the Audit Commission in 2015, there was another layer of scrutiny gone. Staff themselves had nowhere to turn, as concerns were ignored by senior colleagues. At the local authority that I worked for, it felt as if local politicians were desperate to build houses and homes. However, due to the terrible policy of central government whereby right-to-buy receipts couldn’t be used to build replacement housing without additional “external” borrowing, my local authority ended up in dubious deals sold to them by slick consultants. The politicians were just so relieved to be able to say something about affordable homes while these consultants made a packet. Local politicians and local authority staff rarely knew the pitfalls of what they’d signed up to. The Conservatives have done a grand trick of stripping out so much funding and taking away the Audit Commission, that mechanisms of accountability are running thin. And residents will just look to the local politicians and blame them, which is only part of the picture. Name and address supplied • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
