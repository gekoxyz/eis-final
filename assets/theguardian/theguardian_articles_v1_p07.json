                    "body": "<p>No 10 and allies of Liz Truss are resisting the idea that people should be asked to cut their energy use, with the government insisting that consumption of gas and electricity is a “decision for individuals”.</p> <p>With the threat of shortages possible this winter, officials have raised the option of the UK public being requested to reduce their energy usage, after countries in the EU including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter\">France and Germany were asked to cut gas demand by 15%</a>.</p> <p>People across Europe have been urged to switch off lights and use appliances less often, after all member states apart from Hungary agreed to a voluntary cut in usage.</p> <p>However, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who is likely to be Truss’s next chancellor, is opposed to such a move, believing it is not necessary for the UK and that energy use should be up to individuals.</p> <p>Asked whether people should reduce how much energy they use given the high cost and worries about supply, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said on Monday: “These decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals.</p> <p>“Households, businesses and industry can be confident that they will have the electricity and gas that they need.”</p> <p>The government favours a plan put forward by National Grid to incentivise households with smart meters to save energy by paying them to use appliances at off-peak times.</p> <p>“We support the National Grid in developing all options which could benefit consumers and help to reduce bills by spreading out peak demand,” No 10 said.</p> <p>Concern about energy security has risen since a report was leaked to Bloomberg showing the government had prepared crisis plans modelling a situation where businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter.</p> <p>Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combined with gas shortages to leave the country short of power.</p> <p>At the same time, annual energy bills are forecast by one analyst, Auxilione, to top £6,000 next year, triggering Labour to warn that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” if the government does not intervene.</p> <p>Advising households on how to cut energy usage has previously been attempted in a 1922 Committee report published in April, led by Andrea Leadsom, a former energy secretary. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee she chaired proposed that there should be improved guidance on cutting energy usage, better access to existing education and incentive schemes, and clearer messaging on money-saving ideas such as turning off radiators in unused rooms, reducing pressure to hot water taps and reducing radiator settings on gas boilers to between 55C and 65C to optimise energy output.</p> <p>The committee also suggested stronger public messaging on the advantage of smart meters and pressure on energy companies to bring forward smart tariffs. Leadsom said on Monday there was a “really strong case” for these measures.</p> <p>However, politicians can be sensitive about public perceptions of asking people to use less energy. Some energy bosses have been pilloried for giving tips on keeping warm, such as putting on jumpers, doing star jumps, cuddling pets or eating porridge.</p> <p>In the EU, Brussels is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter\">urging governments</a> to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning.</p> <p>Industrial users may also be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas.</p> <p>The government insists that power cuts and energy shortages are extremely unlikely. However, Adam Bell, a former policy senior official at BEIS, told the BBC’s PM programme he thought there was about a one-in-10 chance of seeing limited, planned blackouts in certain parts of the country over the winter.</p> <p>He also said: “The right thing to do now is to get used to lowering our demand so we can eliminate that chance as much as we can.”</p> <p>Bell said there were stages that could be gone through, including switching some industry off, then export pipelines and then homes. “But because we might be in that situation, there’s a lot households should be thinking about now, to help minimise the likelihood … like turning down your thermostat by one degree and optimising the flow temperature in your boiler as well as draught-proofing where you can.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that the UK’s secure and diverse energy supplies will provide the electricity and gas they need.</p> <p>“Decisions on energy consumption rightly remain a matter for individuals and we recognise households will have different energy usage needs.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.org%2Fen%2F%22%3ESignal%20Messenger%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Contact the team securely: create a Protonmail account and email us at guardian.politics.desk@protonmail.com; or use Signal Messenger or WhatsApp to message +44 7824 537227.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.org%2Fen%2F%22%3ESignal%20Messenger%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&link=false\">Interactive</a> </figure>",

                    "bodyText": "No 10 and allies of Liz Truss are resisting the idea that people should be asked to cut their energy use, with the government insisting that consumption of gas and electricity is a “decision for individuals”. With the threat of shortages possible this winter, officials have raised the option of the UK public being requested to reduce their energy usage, after countries in the EU including France and Germany were asked to cut gas demand by 15%. People across Europe have been urged to switch off lights and use appliances less often, after all member states apart from Hungary agreed to a voluntary cut in usage. However, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who is likely to be Truss’s next chancellor, is opposed to such a move, believing it is not necessary for the UK and that energy use should be up to individuals. Asked whether people should reduce how much energy they use given the high cost and worries about supply, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said on Monday: “These decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals. “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that they will have the electricity and gas that they need.” The government favours a plan put forward by National Grid to incentivise households with smart meters to save energy by paying them to use appliances at off-peak times. “We support the National Grid in developing all options which could benefit consumers and help to reduce bills by spreading out peak demand,” No 10 said. Concern about energy security has risen since a report was leaked to Bloomberg showing the government had prepared crisis plans modelling a situation where businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combined with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. At the same time, annual energy bills are forecast by one analyst, Auxilione, to top £6,000 next year, triggering Labour to warn that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” if the government does not intervene. Advising households on how to cut energy usage has previously been attempted in a 1922 Committee report published in April, led by Andrea Leadsom, a former energy secretary. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee she chaired proposed that there should be improved guidance on cutting energy usage, better access to existing education and incentive schemes, and clearer messaging on money-saving ideas such as turning off radiators in unused rooms, reducing pressure to hot water taps and reducing radiator settings on gas boilers to between 55C and 65C to optimise energy output. The committee also suggested stronger public messaging on the advantage of smart meters and pressure on energy companies to bring forward smart tariffs. Leadsom said on Monday there was a “really strong case” for these measures. However, politicians can be sensitive about public perceptions of asking people to use less energy. Some energy bosses have been pilloried for giving tips on keeping warm, such as putting on jumpers, doing star jumps, cuddling pets or eating porridge. In the EU, Brussels is urging governments to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning. Industrial users may also be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas. The government insists that power cuts and energy shortages are extremely unlikely. However, Adam Bell, a former policy senior official at BEIS, told the BBC’s PM programme he thought there was about a one-in-10 chance of seeing limited, planned blackouts in certain parts of the country over the winter. He also said: “The right thing to do now is to get used to lowering our demand so we can eliminate that chance as much as we can.” Bell said there were stages that could be gone through, including switching some industry off, then export pipelines and then homes. “But because we might be in that situation, there’s a lot households should be thinking about now, to help minimise the likelihood … like turning down your thermostat by one degree and optimising the flow temperature in your boiler as well as draught-proofing where you can.” A government spokesperson said: “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that the UK’s secure and diverse energy supplies will provide the electricity and gas they need. “Decisions on energy consumption rightly remain a matter for individuals and we recognise households will have different energy usage needs.”",

Here’s where things stand: The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live. The shelling posses a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson, Agence France-Presse reports. Johansson warned that civilians could act as spies, saboteurs or provocateurs and alleged that some Russian travellers had sought to harass and humiliate Ukrainian refugees, who have been granted protected status within the EU. “We can not exclude that people are coming with the aim to provoke, to try to get some social unrest, or to provoke violence or riots or things like that or to try to use propaganda,” she said. On Friday, the EU formally suspended a 2007 visa facilitation pact that had made it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to Europe, but stopped short of the full travel ban demanded by some member states. Johansson said the new rules would still allow passage to vetted dissidents, journalists and humanitarian cases, but that applications for simple tourist and business visas should be “reassessed.” Just under a million Russians already hold visas for the EU’s Schengen travel area, and the commissioner said member states should also reassess these existing travel documents. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. Agence France-Presse reports: State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said meanwhile that Russia’s push to send reinforcements showed Moscow was paying “huge costs” in its bid to capture and then hold Ukrainian territory. A Moscow-installed official in the region, Vitaliy Ganchev, said in televised remarks that “fierce battles” were under way near Balakliya, a town in the Kharkiv region that Ukraine said it had recaptured on Thursday. “We do not control Balakliya. Attempts are being made to dislodge the Ukrainian forces, but there are fierce battles and our troops are being held back on the approaches,” Ganchev said. “Now Russian reserves have been brought there, our troops are fighting back,” he added. His comments come after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared footage late Thursday showing camouflage-clad Ukrainian soldiers holding his country’s blue-and-yellow flag over Balakliya. The town, which had been under Russian control for around six months and had a pre-war population of around 30,000 people, fell easily and early on to Russian forces who invaded in February. Now, Russian officials in the Kharkiv region say they are evacuating civilians towards Russia “until the situation stabilises.” “We have been trying to focus all our efforts on evacuating the local population for three or four days,” Russian-appointed official Maxim Gubin said. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live, posing a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. Reuters reports: The plant’s offsite power lines, vital lines of defence against potential nuclear meltdown, have already been cut and the shelling at Enerhodar has caused a lasting blackout there. That has prompted Ukraine to say it may have to shut down the last operating reactor supplying power to Zaporizhzhia including the cooling systems for the plant’s nuclear fuel. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar has gone dark. The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, said in a statement. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The first €1bn was fully sent in early August, while the Czech finance minister, Zbynek Stanjura, said upcoming meetings would decide how the remaining €3bn in the package could be split into loans or grants. “All member states agreed on further support for Ukraine,” Stanjura said. The ministers also discussed short-term financing options and longer-term options to help Ukraine fund its reconstruction in the future. A report released Friday by the World Bank, Ukrainian government and European Commission calculated Russia’s invasion caused more than $97bn in direct damages to Ukraine through to 1 June, while it could cost nearly $350bn to rebuild the country. The European Commission vice-president, Valdis Dombrovski, said costs to help re-build Ukraine would be immense as the war drags into a seventh month. “Clearly Ukraine needs short-term financial assistance to keep the country running on a daily basis and maintain essential services,” he said. “We also need to look beyond immediate needs, as long-term costs for Ukraine’s reconstruction are likely to keep growing as long as war continues.” The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The EU will table “unprecedented measures next week for an unprecedented situation”, energy commissioner Kadri Simson said, after meeting the ministers. Simson said compensation for struggling households and businesses would be covered by a levy on non-gas electricity companies, such as nuclear, solar or renewable firms, that are seeing a revenue bonanza on the back of high prices for electric power. She added that fossil fuel companies would also be levied on their mega profits from the inflated energy prices. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. This would leave the plant fully dependent on emergency diesel generators to provide electricity for vital nuclear safety functions. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” Grossi said, the Associated Press reports. “The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” he said. “This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand.” Grossi called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area” and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,” he said. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Vitaly Ganchev said on state television host Vladimir Solovyov’s daily livestream that civilians were being evacuated from the towns of Izium, Kupiansk and Veliky Burluk, Reuters reports. Civilians are being evacuated from Russian-held Izium, and Kupiansk in eastern Ukraine, according to a Russian-appointed local official, Reuters reports. This is a developing story with more details to come … If you’re just joining us, here’s a round-up of all the day’s news from Ukraine so far … Ukraine’s counter-offensive in Kharkiv continues, with Ukrainian forces appearing to be closing in on the city of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the region US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said late last night it was likely the city would be taken within 72 hours, and that its recapture would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. Unverified photos posted to social media appeared to show soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag on the outskirts of the city. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia, another city in the Kharkiv region, shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s military has said the number of Russian soldiers killed since the start of the invasion has reached 51,900. It also said that information provided to it by Ukrainians inside occupied territory has contributed to a recent rise in Russian personnel losses from 150-200 a day to about 600. At least 10 people, three of them children, were injured and a kindergarten was set on fire amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, city mayor Igor Terekhov has said Nine civilians have also been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to local officials. A Russian airstrike hit and destroyed a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy near the Russian border on Friday, Ukrainian officials said. A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security. A spokesperson said the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is “highly unlikely” Belarus is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, despite ongoing military exercises being conducted by the country’s military A spokesperson for President Putin has said he is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. A European Union proposal to cap the price Europe pays for Russian gas did not receive broad support from energy ministers in a meeting on Friday, two diplomats with knowledge of the talks told Reuters. “There was a big debate about capping the price of gas, and the Commission should come up with a proposal that will help reduce the prices of all gas, but at the same time will not jeopardise gas supplies to Europe,” one of the diplomats said. On Wednesday, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said European Union countries should set a price cap on Russian gas. The finance ministers from the G7 countries have already agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports. Asked about the plans at an economic form last week, President Putin said Russia’s response to price caps would be to “just halt supplies” of gas, oil, diesel oil, and coal. At least 10 people, three of them children, have been injured amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, the city’s mayor has said. Writing on Telegram, Igor Terekhov said that private homes and a school were among the buildings hit, and that a kindergarten in the centre of the city was on fire. “I ask all Kharkiv residents to be as careful as possible and stay in shelters,” he said. It is highly unlikely that Belarus’s ongoing military exercises near the Ukrainian border are a sign that it is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. On Thursday, the Belarusian military began routine drills close to Brest near the Polish border, around capital Minsk, and in the north-eastern region of Vitebsk. Belarus said the exercises, set to run until Wednesday, were intended to practice “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. In its latest intelligence update, the UK ministry of defence said: “Although Russia’s use of Belarusian territory was instrumental in Russia’s failed advance on Kyiv early in the invasion, Belarusian forces have limited offensive capabilities and there is a remote chance that they have deployed forces into Ukraine. “It is highly unlikely that these exercises are an indication of preparations for direct Belarusian involvement in the Ukraine war.” Russian personnel losses are increasing because Ukraine is being fed information about the location of Russian forces by Ukrainians who remain in occupied territory, the Ukrainian military has said. Recent figures from the Ukrainian authorities have seen estimates of the number of Russian soldiers being killed each day rise from 150-200 to about 600. The figure for Thursday was 650, bringing the total since the start of the war to 51,900. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the general staff of the armed forces, was asked about the rise during a press briefing on Thursday, Pravda reported. “Conscious Ukrainians, no matter where they are, in occupied Crimea or in the occupied territories of Kherson region, or Zaporizhzhia Oblast, or in Donetsk, Luhansk and other oblasts, conscious citizens effectively help our armed forces,” he said. “It is no secret that thanks to them we have certain information concerning the location of the Russian occupying forces. “Thanks to them we are able to increase these numbers [of Russian losses].” Moldova’s national airline has announced the resumption of flights to Russia. In a statement on its website, Air Moldova said it would begin operating flights to Moscow starting on 1 October. It said the decision was the “result of countless requests from citizens of the Republic of Moldova, who are in the Russian Federation and want to return home”. “The safety and comfort of flights are the company’s priority, thus Air Moldova will continue to make constant efforts to respond to the needs and requests of our passengers,” it said. Air Moldova suspended flights to Russia in February. Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, also closed its entire airspace in the immediate wake of the Russian invasion, but partially reopened it the following month. A Russian airstrike hit a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy on Friday, Ukrainian officials have said. Posting to Telegram, Dmytro Zhivytsky, head of the regional administration, said the attack occurred after 9am local time and that the building, in the Velyka Pysarivka district, had been destroyed. He added that people had been wounded. “The Russians continue to cynically fire at the civilian infrastructure of Sumy oblast,” he said. “Russian enemy aircraft, without crossing the border of Ukraine, fired at a hospital.” Velyka Pysarivka is a small settlement a few miles from Ukraine’s north-western border with Russia. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security, Polish broadcaster Polsat News reports. A spokesperson told the outlet that the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin” of Poland’s support for Ukraine. They added that the invasion was a breach of all possible international standards and that Poland considered the defence of Ukraine part of the defence of its own security. A photo shared on social media appears to show Ukrainian soldiers on the outskirts of the city of Kupiansk. Ukrainian forces have been advancing on the city, which serves as a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region. The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said last night Ukraine would probably recapture the city within 72 hours, and that its loss would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. A picture posted to Twitter by Illia Ponomarenko, a defence reporter at the Kyiv Independent, showed soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag while stood in front of a large road sign bearing the Russian name for Kupiansk. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the image. President Putin is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, his spokesperson has said. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti quoted Dmitry Peskov saying the Kremlin would “wait for the announcement of the protocol of the ceremony” before deciding who would represent Russia. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv has proved that it can drive Russia out of its territories, a key adviser in President Zelenskiy’s government has said. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, said: “What does effective Ukrainian counteroffensive tell the world? “1. Ukraine proved the capability of de-occupying its territories. There will be no freezing of the conflict. “2. Ukraine proved that it can effectively use modern western weapons. “3. Russian troops have to get out. It will hurt.” A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The ministry said it was cooperating with global health organisation Project Hope to restore healthcare access across Ukraine. It added that 62 facilities damaged by Russian forces had already been restored. In a statement, deputy health minister Bohdan Borukhovskyi said: “We are now consolidating efforts with our partners to first of all restore hospitals that have received minor damage and can be rebuilt in the shortest possible time. “In parallel with this, we are implementing several more projects in Kyiv Oblast and Sumy Oblast, where medical facilities are being built virtually from scratch.” President Zelenskiy has said efforts continue to keep agricultural exports moving through Ukrainian ports and maintain global food security. Exports of grain and other agricultural goods have been been able to leave Ukraine since a deal agreed between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the UN in July. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy spoken with Kenyan president-elect William Ruto about overcoming food shortages. “We are doing everything for this,” he said. “Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. “At [present], more than 65,000 tons of wheat [are entering] the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya – more than 50,000 tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. “In the Pivdennyi Port [a port near Odesa], a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded. “Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level.” In a speech on Wednesday, President Putin said the deal should be revised, claiming it was delivering products to the European Union and Turkey rather than to poor countries. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia near Kharkiv shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Balakliia lies around 70km (43 miles) south-east of Kharkiv city, in the centre of the territory on which Ukraine has launched a major counter-offensive. One clip posted to twitter by Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk shows men and women emerging from a building to hug soldiers as they arrive. Some of the people can be seen crying. Another shows two women hugging and taking photos with soldiers gathered on a plaza. Nine civilians have been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to Ukrainian officials. Posting to Telegram, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said: “Russia kills civilians! “On September 8, the Russians killed nine civilians of Donetsk region: five in Bakhmut, two in Zaitsevo, one in New York and one in Fedorivka. Another 23 people were injured.” He added that it was not possible to establish how many people had been killed in Mariupol and Volnovas. “All Russians will be held accountable for their crimes on our land!” he said. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken has left Ukraine after making an unannounced visit on Thursday. The trip, Blinken’s third since the war began on 24 February, included meetings with President Zelenskiy and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as a visit to a children’s hospital in Kyiv. Photos posted to Twitter showed him speaking with officials before boarding a train. “Stay strong, Kyiv,” a caption read. “I leave with redoubled respect for your ferocity, your courage, and your confidence that Ukraine will prevail.” A further 650 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine, according to the latest update from the Ukrainian ministry of defence. Figures posted to twitter said Russia’s personnel losses since the start of the war had reached 51,900, up from 51,250 since yesterday. It added that, since the start of the invasion, Russia had lost a total of 2122 tanks, 4575 armoured combat vehicles, 239 jets, and 211 helicopters. The tweet also opened with a quote from a second world war radio broadcast delivered to the children of the Commonwealth by Queen Elizabeth II in October 1940, when she was still a princess. “When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place,” it read. The G7’s planned price cap on Russian oil exports will fail and drive prices even higher, Russia’s top lawmaker has claimed. Posting on Telegram, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, said that “what G7 state officials call a price ‘ceiling’ will become a price floor”. “The global market is not limited to seven countries,” he said. “The marginal price announced by the west will become the lower bar.” Last week, the finance ministers from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan announced plans for a cap intended to “reduce Russian revenues and Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. The European Union has also proposed a price cap for Russian gas, and is set to phase in a ban on Russian oil imports over the coming months. Speaking in Vladivostok on Wednesday, President Putin threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Ukraine is likely to retake the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region within 72 hours, US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has said. The group’s latest assessment said Ukrainian forces had advanced to within 20km of the city, and that retaking it would significantly worsen communication between Russian forces in the region. “Russian rear positions in Kharkiv Oblast are now exposed to further Ukrainian advances, and Ukrainian forces will likely capture Kupiansk within the next 72 hours,” it said. “The loss of Kupiansk and other rear areas on critical ground lines of communication will hinder Russian efforts to support offensive and defence operations, but will not completely sever Russian lines of communication to Izyum.” The space between the Izyum and the city of Kharkiv to its north-west currently forms part of the frontline between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Good morning and welcome to our Ukraine live blog. We’ll be bringing you all the latest updates from the conflict throughout the day. First up, President Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,000 sq km of territory over the last week. It follows a surprise counter-offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and sustained pressure on Russian forces in the south. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results. “In total, more than a thousand square kilometres of our territory have been liberated since 1 September.” He went on to thank everyone serving in the armed forces and the brigades that had retaken territory. Zelenskiy also acknowledged $675m in military aid announced yesterday by the US and the $1bn Ukraine is set to receive from a general package of support for 19 European countries deemed at risk of future Russian aggression. “Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defence against Russian terror,” he said.",

Let warming go wild, in other words. It might be fun. Sure, it was over a decade ago and don’t let’s cancel him for ever over a tiny little book – all he did was mindlessly risk the end of the species.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-cabinet-news-pm-therese-coffey-uk-politics-live\">Liz Truss accused of seeking to evade scrutiny over announcement of energy bills plan – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, beneath these morbid symptoms the global energy crisis has sparked conversations that are real, perhaps for the first time – certainly, it’s the first time that so many nations have been having them simultaneously.</p> <p>It seems likely that the prime minister’s first move will be to tear up everything she campaigned on and roll over to the opposition’s suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/06/liz-truss-expected-to-freeze-uk-energy-bills-at-2500-a-year\">energy bills be frozen</a> at April 2022’s levels. Partly because of her inelegant flip-flopping, partly due to harsh economic realities, it is obvious that this sticking plaster, while necessary, is insufficient. The competing alternative narratives are red (sequester North Sea gas and let wholesalers take their rampant profiteering elsewhere) and green (ramp up renewables until fossil fuel supply is no longer relevant – 45% of UK electricity is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1086781/Energy_Trends_June_2022.pdf\">already from renewables</a>).</p> <p>Crucially, these narratives don’t compete with each other. You don’t need to gate off the conversation about the pros and cons of retaking gas at source before you can start talking about expanding renewables. It would be reasonable to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uk-energy-crisis-time-split-power-market-michael-liebreich\">split the energy market</a> into clean power and fossil power, so that the price of gas was not setting the price of solar and wind, and the incentive to lean heavily on the latter and reduce consumption of the former became universal. Ideas that seemed unthinkably radical a year ago now look much less extreme than the reality we’re facing this winter.</p> <p>We’ve now spent 12 years living this cognitive dissonance, where we have longstanding net-zero ambitions enshrined in law, a climate crisis unfolding with alarming speed, and successive Conservative prime ministers making asinine remarks about “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices\">green crap</a>”, then throwing the environmental agenda to the wind whenever they needed to assuage their sociopathically short-termist party members.</p> <p>Any progress we’ve made has been despite our own government, and so much of our collective mental energy has been lost to denial: denying that we’re not moving fast enough, denying that the heatwave was of our own making, denying that we’ve probably already left it too late to save the things we love – whether that’s beaches or biodiversity .</p> <p>We needed Vladimir Putin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/sep/07/putin-threatens-to-freeze-west-by-cutting-gas-and-oil-supplies-if-price-caps-imposed-video\">energy war</a> to get serious about how stark our situation is. This is not to predict any sudden conversion to sense from Truss, but rather to point out that the brass-necked irrationality of Tory arguments – that somehow net zero targets were pushing everyone’s bills up, and woke warriors had started it all by cancelling Nigel Lawson – will no longer fly. Having given the opposition a lead in the polls, the Conservatives have also given it an electorate sick of rhetoric and inaction, ready for bold ideas.</p> <p>Even with an energy bill freeze, the cost of living crisis has already moved the dial. The idea that hardship is mainly down to personal inadequacy has become fanciful. The notion that people can scrimp their way to solvency, which is given in justification for so many harmful policy decisions, has been comprehensively overturned. There are the green shoots of a new solidarity across all nine bottom deciles. For goodness sake, this woeful party has radicalised centrist dad <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/martin-lewis-liz-truss-energy-bill-plan-182328720.html\">Martin Lewis</a>, and they don’t even seem to understand how serious that is, what it means for their prospects.</p> <p>Putin, meanwhile, has overplayed his hand: his threat of disruption to energy supply has historically been enough to keep his neighbours docile, and maintain the scratchy equilibrium between democratic states and his increasingly authoritarian one. Actually disrupting the energy supply, conversely, will force us and the EU towards renewable alternatives, and once that gains momentum, the link between geopolitics and carbon resources will ultimately be severed. Good luck with strongman politics when there’s nothing underpinning them but bot farms tweeting mean things.</p> <p>No one would ever wish to have been brought to a place where there are no alternatives. It would be better if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, if inflation were under control, if energy bills weren’t spiralling into impossibility. It would be better if the UK’s situation weren’t so particularly, idiosyncratically, bad. This is what a country looks like after 12 years of people who don’t believe in government, being in government. It turns out if you focus all your energy and resource on cronyism and getting re-elected, you can make life much harder for millions of people in a relatively short space of time.</p> <p>But, for the want of alternatives, we will emerge from the next election with not only a new government but a radical and uncompromising plan for energy that will transform the way we live. We’ll look back on this as the inflection point that got us to net zero.</p> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

                    "bodyText": "It’s not looking great for the climate, our change of prime minister: Liz Truss, who has about as much expertise in British geomorphology as she does in cheese, seems to think we can frack our way out of the energy crisis by Christmas, and that nuclear power is a similarly quick answer. Her newly appointed chief economic adviser, Matthew Sinclair, wrote a book entitled Let Them Eat Carbon in 2011, in which he argued that “the temperatures we face today may not be the ideal conditions for humanity to live and flourish”. Let warming go wild, in other words. It might be fun. Sure, it was over a decade ago and don’t let’s cancel him for ever over a tiny little book – all he did was mindlessly risk the end of the species. However, beneath these morbid symptoms the global energy crisis has sparked conversations that are real, perhaps for the first time – certainly, it’s the first time that so many nations have been having them simultaneously. It seems likely that the prime minister’s first move will be to tear up everything she campaigned on and roll over to the opposition’s suggestion that energy bills be frozen at April 2022’s levels. Partly because of her inelegant flip-flopping, partly due to harsh economic realities, it is obvious that this sticking plaster, while necessary, is insufficient. The competing alternative narratives are red (sequester North Sea gas and let wholesalers take their rampant profiteering elsewhere) and green (ramp up renewables until fossil fuel supply is no longer relevant – 45% of UK electricity is already from renewables). Crucially, these narratives don’t compete with each other. You don’t need to gate off the conversation about the pros and cons of retaking gas at source before you can start talking about expanding renewables. It would be reasonable to split the energy market into clean power and fossil power, so that the price of gas was not setting the price of solar and wind, and the incentive to lean heavily on the latter and reduce consumption of the former became universal. Ideas that seemed unthinkably radical a year ago now look much less extreme than the reality we’re facing this winter. We’ve now spent 12 years living this cognitive dissonance, where we have longstanding net-zero ambitions enshrined in law, a climate crisis unfolding with alarming speed, and successive Conservative prime ministers making asinine remarks about “green crap”, then throwing the environmental agenda to the wind whenever they needed to assuage their sociopathically short-termist party members. Any progress we’ve made has been despite our own government, and so much of our collective mental energy has been lost to denial: denying that we’re not moving fast enough, denying that the heatwave was of our own making, denying that we’ve probably already left it too late to save the things we love – whether that’s beaches or biodiversity . We needed Vladimir Putin’s energy war to get serious about how stark our situation is. This is not to predict any sudden conversion to sense from Truss, but rather to point out that the brass-necked irrationality of Tory arguments – that somehow net zero targets were pushing everyone’s bills up, and woke warriors had started it all by cancelling Nigel Lawson – will no longer fly. Having given the opposition a lead in the polls, the Conservatives have also given it an electorate sick of rhetoric and inaction, ready for bold ideas. Even with an energy bill freeze, the cost of living crisis has already moved the dial. The idea that hardship is mainly down to personal inadequacy has become fanciful. The notion that people can scrimp their way to solvency, which is given in justification for so many harmful policy decisions, has been comprehensively overturned. There are the green shoots of a new solidarity across all nine bottom deciles. For goodness sake, this woeful party has radicalised centrist dad Martin Lewis, and they don’t even seem to understand how serious that is, what it means for their prospects. Putin, meanwhile, has overplayed his hand: his threat of disruption to energy supply has historically been enough to keep his neighbours docile, and maintain the scratchy equilibrium between democratic states and his increasingly authoritarian one. Actually disrupting the energy supply, conversely, will force us and the EU towards renewable alternatives, and once that gains momentum, the link between geopolitics and carbon resources will ultimately be severed. Good luck with strongman politics when there’s nothing underpinning them but bot farms tweeting mean things. No one would ever wish to have been brought to a place where there are no alternatives. It would be better if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, if inflation were under control, if energy bills weren’t spiralling into impossibility. It would be better if the UK’s situation weren’t so particularly, idiosyncratically, bad. This is what a country looks like after 12 years of people who don’t believe in government, being in government. It turns out if you focus all your energy and resource on cronyism and getting re-elected, you can make life much harder for millions of people in a relatively short space of time. But, for the want of alternatives, we will emerge from the next election with not only a new government but a radical and uncompromising plan for energy that will transform the way we live. We’ll look back on this as the inflection point that got us to net zero. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

Yet they were completed within a few years of each other, 1975 and 1973, a few miles apart on the coast of north-west Wales. A good way to experience the poles of British 20th-century architecture is to walk from one to the other, and enjoy some ravishing landscapes on the way. This is a land that runs to extremes of large and small, and harsh and sweet.

At the end of July, Russia further reduced supply to the continent, making it harder – and more expensive – for countries to ensure reserves of gas ahead of the winter.</p> <p>In the UK, the government has offered a trickle of policies that are supposed to lighten the load, including a one-off £400 energy bill discount for households and windfall taxes on energy companies that are reporting exceedingly high profits.

So what’s everyone else doing?</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong></p> <p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream\">Russia supplied</a> over 50% of Germany’s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won’t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep.</p> <p>The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It’s not ideal – the government’s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as “painful but necessary”— but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany’s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country’s only three remaining nuclear plants.</p> <p>The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany’s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany’s climate and transformation fund.</p> <p><br>***</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country’s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues.</p> <p>France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France’s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower.</p> <p>Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France’s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly €10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a €20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>US</strong></p> <p>It’s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely.</p> <p>In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently – which in the context of the US’s political gridlock is unlikely. <br></p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong></p> <p>Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis.</p> <p>Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse – as the crisis continues, it’s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan’s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders.</p> <p>To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years – most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m.

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. The energy standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe continues to spiral. At the end of July, Russia further reduced supply to the continent, making it harder – and more expensive – for countries to ensure reserves of gas ahead of the winter. In the UK, the government has offered a trickle of policies that are supposed to lighten the load, including a one-off £400 energy bill discount for households and windfall taxes on energy companies that are reporting exceedingly high profits. But is this enough – and how is the rest of the world coping? In today’s newsletter we outline the measures taken by five other countries to address the global energy crisis. Five big stories NHS | The health minister Maria Caulfield has admitted that 34 hospitals have roofs made of concrete that are so badly maintained they could collapse at any moment. Salman Rushdie | The author’s “road to recovery has begun” but “will be long” after his stabbing in western New York, the novelist’s agent has said. “The injuries are severe,” Andrew Wylie told the Guardian in an email – Rushdie received “life changing” injuries to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh. “But his condition is headed in the right direction.” Water | A Lib Dem councillor has called for Thames Water to be fined after it cut water supplies leading to hundreds of households in Surrey having to go three days without tap water at the height of the heatwave. Labour | Keir Starmer has set out a £29bn proposal that Labour says would avoid people having to pay “a penny more” on their energy bills this winter. It includes an £8bn windfall tax on energy company profits and insulating 19m homes over the next decade. Immigration | Data released by the ONS shows there has been a dramatic drop in EU citizens moving to the UK. Last year 43,000 EU citizens received visas for work, family, study or other purposes, in comparison with 230,000 to 430,000 between 2014-2020. In depth: From nationalising utilities to aircon bans, how other countries are coping With reports that energy bills are going to cost the equivalent of two months’ wages by next year, it seems increasingly important that the British government takes a preemptive, rather than reactive, approach to the crisis. So what’s everyone else doing? *** Germany In 2020, Russia supplied over 50% of Germany’s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won’t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep. The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It’s not ideal – the government’s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as “painful but necessary”— but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany’s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country’s only three remaining nuclear plants. The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany’s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany’s climate and transformation fund. *** France There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country’s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues. France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France’s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower. Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France’s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly €10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a €20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices. *** US It’s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely. In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently – which in the context of the US’s political gridlock is unlikely. *** Japan Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis. Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse – as the crisis continues, it’s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy. *** Pakistan For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan’s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders. To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years – most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m. Pakistan is also looking inward and, like many other countries, turning to its nuclear plants to alleviate some of the pressure. Whether this will be enough is unclear.

                    "body": "<p>Vicki Lesley’s sprightly, inconclusive documentary tackles a perennially controversial subject: nuclear power and its contested ethical status. Like almost all documentaries these days, this begins with a clip of some sonorous 1950s propaganda film – shorthand for the hilariously naive, reactionary stance that we’ve supposedly overcome. It is an amusing gimmick, but in danger of being overused here.</p> <p>Nuclear power was idealistically embraced after the war as part of our white-hot technological future (a notable partisan was once Labour politician Tony Benn) but then rejected with the news of terrifying accidents, notably the partial meltdown at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/30/archive-three-mile-island-nuclear-accident-1979\">Three Mile Island</a> in the United States in 1979. (Lesley perhaps should have mentioned the very real importance of James Bridges’ movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078966/\">The China Syndrome</a>, a nuclear-disaster drama that came out just before Three Mile Island; praised as prophetic and genuinely instrumental in popularising anti-nuclear attitudes.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl5hKpmwi0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lyl5hKpmwi0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ecological campaigners, particularly in West Germany, led the charge in Europe against nuclear energy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster\">The Chernobyl horror in 1986</a> frightened even the most diehard pro-nuclear interests; and in 2011, just when we were getting complacent, there was the chilling incident at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima</a> in Japan. Yet the climate crisis, the key question of the age, brought a new revisionist case for nuclear power.</p> <p>The climate crisis is the slo-mo disaster that looms as large in our minds as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima; nuclear does not emit greenhouse gases, and is still capable of wholesale power generation. Should theoretical future increases in nuclear safety be weighed against the climate disaster that is happening right now, under our noses? For the time being, our love affair with nuclear is over, leaving us with a joyless marriage to fossil fuels, and a chaste courtship with renewables.</p> <p>Lesley gives the last word to the passionate and persuasive anti-nuclear campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ralph-nader\">Ralph Nader</a>, though her film does not commit itself in the same way.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-atom-a-love-affair-online\">The Atom: A Love Affair is available on Curzon Home Cinema</a> from 15 May.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Vicki Lesley’s sprightly, inconclusive documentary tackles a perennially controversial subject: nuclear power and its contested ethical status. Like almost all documentaries these days, this begins with a clip of some sonorous 1950s propaganda film – shorthand for the hilariously naive, reactionary stance that we’ve supposedly overcome. It is an amusing gimmick, but in danger of being overused here. Nuclear power was idealistically embraced after the war as part of our white-hot technological future (a notable partisan was once Labour politician Tony Benn) but then rejected with the news of terrifying accidents, notably the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979. (Lesley perhaps should have mentioned the very real importance of James Bridges’ movie The China Syndrome, a nuclear-disaster drama that came out just before Three Mile Island; praised as prophetic and genuinely instrumental in popularising anti-nuclear attitudes.) Ecological campaigners, particularly in West Germany, led the charge in Europe against nuclear energy. The Chernobyl horror in 1986 frightened even the most diehard pro-nuclear interests; and in 2011, just when we were getting complacent, there was the chilling incident at Fukushima in Japan. Yet the climate crisis, the key question of the age, brought a new revisionist case for nuclear power. The climate crisis is the slo-mo disaster that looms as large in our minds as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima; nuclear does not emit greenhouse gases, and is still capable of wholesale power generation. Should theoretical future increases in nuclear safety be weighed against the climate disaster that is happening right now, under our noses? For the time being, our love affair with nuclear is over, leaving us with a joyless marriage to fossil fuels, and a chaste courtship with renewables. Lesley gives the last word to the passionate and persuasive anti-nuclear campaigner Ralph Nader, though her film does not commit itself in the same way. • The Atom: A Love Affair is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 15 May.",

                    "body": "<p>Before, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread. At least, if we weren’t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it.</p> <p>Since arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before.</p> <p>Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf – a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets.</p> <p>I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight.</p> <p>The fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russian-soldiers-accused-of-firing-on-civilian-vehicles-in-ukraine\">13 bakery staff were killed</a> and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more – “Makariv bread” is a thing of the past.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ukraine-crisis-jeopardises-middle-easts-black-sea-wheat-supply-2022-03-07/\">in Egypt</a>, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal – fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it’s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker’s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it.</p> <p>Bread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped “dumb” unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/03/ukraine-russian-dumb-bomb-air-strike-kills-civilians-in-chernihiv-new-investigation-and-testimony/\">documented</a> this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it – the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/named-ukrainians-killed-since-russia-invaded\">young volunteers</a> who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2022/03/07/monday-march-7-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/\">postmen</a> who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/ukraine-russia-civilians-missiles-kyiv-tv-tower\">attack</a> on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged.</p> <p>International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms – the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f85c985c5476667a1d5d0c0d5492a2074b152c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f85c985c5476667a1d5d0c0d5492a2074b152c/0_395_6577_3946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People take shelter in a Kyiv metro station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People take shelter in a Kyiv metro station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world.

They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial – a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russians-crowd-trains-helsinki-passage-eu-narrows-2022-03-08/\">trying to leave</a> their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin.</p> <p>Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. “Jail awaits us if we return!” they say.</p> <p>On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It’s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don’t want to fight either. I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action.</p> <p>In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears.</p> <p>But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/12/russia-ukraine-crimean-tatars-dissent-repression\">Crimean Tatar activists</a> and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60638949\">kept inside</a> the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don’t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know\">Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</a>, which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions.</p> <p>“You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev.</p> <p>I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and author of Death and the Penguin</p></li> </ul>",

While he pays respectful attention to the fauna that he encounters as he tacks from the Romney Marshes to Louisiana’s bayous by way of the Danube delta, it is the people he is after. The Lipovans, Cajuns and Seminole are all ethnic groups that have moulded a culture from the sludge squelching between their toes and this is the true subject of Blass’s bracingly original work. Above all, he is scrupulous about avoiding cliches. There are, for instance, very few glorious sunsets in Swamp Songs or encounters with gnarly old locals acting as aquifers for ancient wisdom, small mercies for which the reader should be grateful.</p> <p>This desire to skewer the cliches of his chosen genre starts early on, when Blass makes a trip to Dungeness, which in summer “is overrun by sea kale, psycho-geographers and, dammit, by people like me”. What people like him tend to be after, of course, is Prospect Cottage, the isolated clapperboard dwelling in which the film director Derek Jarman spent his last years cultivating his garden, a Shintoesque, salt-blown wonder in the lee of the looming nuclear power station. Even here, Blass can’t resist undercutting the conventions of his chosen genre, which may, indeed, be psycho-geography. “‘That’s it,’ they say. ‘That’s Derek Jarman’s house.’ And they move on, because really, there isn’t a great deal to see.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>To ‘drain the swamp’ is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such deadpanning is much in evidence too when Blass heads for the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/great-dismal-swamp\" title=\"\">Great Dismal Swamp</a> of Virginia’s coastal plane. The very name of the place is tautologous, since from the 17th century the word “dismal” was a catch-all term for a quagmire. “In other words, all swamps were dismal by dint of being swampy,” he writes. Still, Dismal does seem to live up to the modern usage, offering the visiting Blass nothing but a series of guarded, misfiring interactions with the inhabitants who are doing their favourite thing of fishing for bowfin and bullheads while giving nothing away.</p> <p>The only clue as to what may lie behind this persistent sense of Dismal’s menace is the fact that in the domestic front yards you can see Confederate flags alongside the more usual stars and stripes. The year is 2016, and as Blass drives round the edge of the swamp the US presidential election is only a few weeks away. Everywhere he sees placards that bear the slogans “Lock Her Up” and “Make America Great Again”. Most chilling of all, though, is the exhortation to “Drain the Swamp”. Blass discovers that historically the Dismal was the last redoubt of Black people running away from the plantations, fugitive Native Americans, English and Irish indentured labourers. Seen in this context, to “drain the swamp” is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen.</p> <p>Before Britons feel too smug, Blass finds this dynamic alive and well closer to home. Back at the Romney Marshes, near to where he lives, he explores the local romance of smuggling, which has endured over centuries thanks to the watery inlets that allow small boats to drift quietly ashore and unload well away from the customs officer’s gaze. But Blass turns his binoculars sharply round and, before we know it, we are confronting the fact that every month refugees are smuggled across the Channel to land at nearby Dover.

                    "bodyText": "A property donated by the family of renowned satirist and comedian John Clarke has become embroiled in a long-running dispute between two First Nations groups in Victoria. The land on Phillip Island, about 120km south-east of Melbourne, was donated by Clarke’s widow, Helen McDonald, to conservation group Trust for Nature after his death in 2017. Trust for Nature intends to transfer the eight-hectare property to the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation, however a local traditional owner has demanded that be halted. While the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation is the registered local Aboriginal party, the area involves land on which members of the Boonwurrung people is seeking native title via the federal court. Boonwurrung elder Carolyn Briggs said Trust for Nature had made no effort to consult with her people about the handover. “Once again we have been ignored and decisions made for us by non-Indigenous people,” she told Guardian Australia. Briggs argued the Trust for Nature should postpone the land transfer to allow the legal process to run its course. Gayle Austen, the chair of Trust for Nature, said it was continuing negotiations with the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation regarding the Phillip Island property. “This does not in any way affect the native title claim that the Boon Wurrung Foundation are pursuing, and which doesn’t apply to privately owned property,” she said. “Trust for Nature continues to work with all traditional owner groups across Victoria on a range of projects and Caring for Country initiatives. We have expressed our desire to connect with the Boon Wurrung Foundation and explore opportunities with them into the future.” The agreement includes 12 months access and managed rights followed by a title transfer next year. The chair of the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation board of directors, Kelly Lehmann, said the transfer was an “amazing opportunity” for Bunurong people. “Through this land we can further support our future generations in learning culture and Caring for Country,” she said in a statement. The native title lawyer James Fitzgerald said the dispute highlighted “the challenges faced when you try to unscramble the eggs of colonialism 200 years after the event”.

The council said due to this disruption, the historical record linking current day people with Boon Wurrung – also known as Bunurong – ancestors is in some places incomplete or contradictory. The Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council has long argued that it is not represented by the Bunurong Land Council, which it has previously claimed was largely made up of interstate members. The Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council – a public body made up of the 11 traditional owners appointed by the state government – has previously rejected the Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council’s application to be listed as a registered Aboriginal party. Registered Aboriginal parties are traditional owner groups that are legally recognised under the state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act and have responsibility for managing and protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage relating to Country. Under the state’s Traditional Owner Settlement Act, traditional owners are also recognised outside the federal native title scheme. Briggs has previously criticised the Aboriginal Heritage Council for recognising the Bunurong Land Council as representatives of the Boonwurrung people. But in 2019 the state’s supreme court upheld the council’s move to grant the Bunurong Land Council the status of a registered Aboriginal party. The Boonwurrung group is pursuing a native title claim covering about 13,000 sq km over large swathes of Melbourne and Gippsland. The Bunurong Land Council did not respond to questions about the dispute when contacted by Guardian Australia.",

                    "bodyText": "By the time Rebecca Khadka arrived at a midweek inspection for a unit to rent in Homebush, she already felt as if she had compromised too much in her desperation to find a home. It is Khadka’s 11th rental inspection. Her expectations have shrunk from a three-bedroom apartment in Strathfield to a two-bedroom unit anywhere in the surrounding suburbs, and her budget has increased by $100 a week to $700. Her applications keep being rejected. “It’s really tough out there, because I don’t want to go too far, I want to live closer to the city, not further from it,” she said. “We didn’t expect the market to be this competitive, and this expensive.” “It’s frustrating having to move from where you are comfortable … I don’t want that change in environment.” Khadka, who works as a nurse in central Sydney, said she had seen up to 40 people at some inspections, scrambling just like she is to find a home as the rental market approaches crisis levels. A survey conducted by the Real Estate Institute of NSW shows the vacancy rate has dropped to a “historical low” of 1.7%. The number of renters per available property had risen by 28% year-on-year, according to the June 2022 rental report from property analysts PropTrack, and Sydney and Melbourne had the greatest increases. The report also found that the number of new rental listings was 13.8% lower nationwide than the 10-year average. The total volume of rental listings was 18.2% lower year-on-year for June, and 27.7% lower than the 10-year average. The consequences of this rental property shortfall is skyrocketing rent, cut-throat demand and a market that leaves those unable to compete without a home. Maya, who asked to go by her first name only, is a single mother of four-year-old twins. She was given just two weeks’ notice to vacate her rental home in Yagoona. That was extended to four weeks after she begged her landlord, she said. Maya said she rushed to inspect and apply for as many properties as possible, spending all day at inspections and all night on the phone with real estate agents. “The landlords kept calling me, every day, pushing me to leave,” she told Guardian Australia. “They said they wanted the property, and when I told them how hard it had been to find somewhere, they said they didn’t care. “They told me it was my problem, that I could end up on the street with my twins.” She applied for more than 15 properties and was finally accepted one day before her notice to vacate took effect. Her new home is smaller but is also more expensive than her previous rental. “Even if it wasn’t what I wanted, even if it was completely different to my expectations, I’m going to love it no matter what,” she said. “It was just so painful to find.” Matthew Everingham, a director and auctioneer at Richard Matthews Real Estate, said that while rent increases were difficult for tenants, “the cost of ownership has significantly increased”.“To be fair though, we haven’t seen a rental market increase like this in many, many years,” he said. “I think the lack of supply is a real catalyst for the competitive nature of the rental market. If there’s not many available, and you’ve got a large amount of prospective tenants looking, then, of course, you’re going to get that demand.” Everingham said some rental inspections had gone from attracting four or five people, to averaging groups of “40 to 50 people”. He said he had noticed more people moving farther west to secure cheaper rent. “We’re seeing a real push from some – moving into the south-west, looking for more value for money and for larger properties,” he said. “And since cost of living has gone up significantly, if they could save a couple of hundred a week and move 15 minutes down the road, they’re going to take it up.” Prof Nicole Gurran, an urban planner and policy analyst at the University of Sydney, said a reduction in rates of homeownership was a major driver behind increased competition for rental properties. “We’ve got a squeezing out of people who would have previously been moving into homeownership, and are stuck in the rental market, as well as those who don’t have the income support, and don’t have the budgets to afford rent,” Gurran said. “We’ve not provided sufficient subsidies for people to be able to afford decent housing in the private rental sector. So there’s been a chronic shortage of low-cost, rental housing in the right location.” “You now have moderate and low income families competing in the same market as those on solid incomes, and it’s squeezing them.” Gurran said that while increasing the amount of social housing provided by the government would alleviate some supply issues, she said expanding the commonwealth rent assistance program would be “the quickest short-term fix”.",

Staff and media beneficiaries remain perplexed about what the institute’s new mission to promote “social change journalism” means. The executive director, Mark Ryan, formally exited the institute last week saying he was considering legal action. “To date, no coherent rationale has been provided for what was a totally unnecessary disruption to the institute and its hard-working staff,” Ryan said in an email to council members. “I remain unable to provide a full account of the behaviour of the patron and have no intention of responding to the many media requests I’ve received to provide my version of events. “I’m advised by Australia’s preeminent employment law firm Clayton Utz that I have strong grounds to pursue an adverse action claim and I’m reserving my rights in that regard.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neilson recently arrived back in the country after an extended overseas trip.

                    "bodyText": "The first monkeypox vaccines have arrived in Australia, with the rollout commencing in Victoria this week. The virus was declared last month as a “communicable disease incident of national significance” by Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly. The Victorian minister for health, Mary-Anne Thomas, announced on Tuesday that the state had received an initial 3,500 doses of the Jynneos vaccine. Thorne Harbour Health, which operates clinics in Abbotsford and St Kilda, began vaccinating people at 11am the next morning, said Colin Batrouney, its director of health promotion, policy and communications. Demand has been high. “People are very, very motivated and mobilised to get vaccinated,” Batrouney said. “All of our vaccine slots were filled prior to us even opening the door on Wednesday.” Dr George Forgan-Smith, a general practitioner at the Collins Street Medical Centre in Melbourne’s CBD who also began administering Jynneos on Wednesday, said he had a waiting list for the vaccine of about 200 people. As of Friday, there had been 34 cases of monkeypox recorded in Victoria. In the first phase of the rollout, the vaccine is primarily available from five clinics in metro Victoria. Several regional locations are also involved in the rollout, but supplies will be limited until September, when more doses are set to arrive. What do we know about Jynneos? Jynneos is a third-generation smallpox vaccine that is also effective against monkeypox, because the two viruses are closely related. It has fewer side-effects than previous smallpox vaccines, and is administered in two doses, at least 28 days apart. The vaccine is administered under the skin near the tricep muscle in the upper arm. Some people may experience a sore arm, redness or itchiness at the injection site, and flu-like symptoms, Forgan-Smith said. “I had my shot on Wednesday with my GP, and I didn’t have much of a reaction other than feeling a bit tired. Most of my patients have been OK.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The only group that might have a slightly bigger response is people who have eczema or [predisposition to] allergies,” Forgan-Smith said, emphasising that it was still safe for people with skin conditions. “It’s safe for all who are HIV positive. It’s safe for people who are immunocompromised, and it’s safe for people with eczema.” Who is eligible for the monkeypox vaccine? Currently, eligibility is limited to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, laboratory workers who analyse monkeypox specimens, and certain men (both cis and trans) who have sex with men. The last category includes those living with HIV, who attend sex on premises venues, or are intending to engage in sexual practices in North America or Europe before 31 October. Sex workers who engage with any of the mentioned groups are also eligible. For those planning to travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, vaccination is recommended four to six weeks ahead of departure, Batrouney said. Forgan-Smith emphasised monkeypox was not a sexually transmitted disease. “It’s transmitted through skin to skin contact,” he said. “Sex is a brilliant way to have skin to skin contact … but [the virus can also be transmitted by] giving somebody a hug, or going to an event and rubbing against people.” “In some ways we’re lucky it’s winter in Australia because people are covered more,” Forgan-Smith said. He urged people who have recently returned from overseas to be vigilant. “If you notice that you’re getting a flu-like illness and you’re feeling horrible, if you’re developing a rash that looks a little bit like chickenpox, then it could be monkeypox,” he said. “The patients I’ve seen didn’t have hundreds of sores.” “The numbers are small, so we can potentially contain this outbreak in Australia if we can get enough people vaccinated.”",

Fears are growing that Jair Bolsonaro could refuse to accept defeat in Brazil’s crunch election this Sunday after his politician son claimed Brazil’s far-right president was the victim of “the greatest electoral fraud ever seen” amid unproven allegations of foul play. Protests against the Iranian government have regained momentum as funerals for those killed and a highly emotional commemoration of the movement have stretched security forces drawn into a further cycle of arrests and repression. Elon Musk has claimed he has “acquired Twitter” in a post to the social network reassuring advertisers it will stay a safe place for their brands, amid fears one of his first actions as chief executive will be to restore Donald Trump’s account. Recommended reads Halloween is fast approaching, and with it comes questions about the excessive confectionary kids gather in the course of their trick or treating. So, with buckets of sweets on the horizon, should parents let them binge the sweet stash in one fell swoop before returning to healthier programming? “I’m in love with this planet and the people who inhabit it,” Heather Rose writes in her memoir. But it is not until you come to the last chapters of the memoir that you understand how hard won this has been. Rose has chosen to live with joy.

Thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s events:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric</strong>, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kyiv</strong> <strong>has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. </strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”.</strong> Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics.</p></li> <li><p><strong>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. </strong>Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. </strong>“We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. </strong>Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. </strong>Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation<strong> </strong>was transparent,<strong> </strong>news agencies reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine.</strong> It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, </strong>its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian</strong> <strong>refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, </strong>according to research by Thomson Reuters.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. </strong>“On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said.</strong> Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military.</strong> Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. </strong>Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. </strong>The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. </strong>On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit.</strong> Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. </strong>It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-642069038f0893440cca1b16\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time

Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed.</p> <p>A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits.</p> <p>A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations.</p> <p>The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old.</p> <p>But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War.</p> <p>One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him.</p> <p>“It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-03-26T12:00:55.160Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6420167e8f08b7a5ff80ac54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-03-26T11:31:09.026Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42fb6a79b1b5b98531b0a51e2529d10db0301668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42fb6a79b1b5b98531b0a51e2529d10db0301668/0_0_8195_4919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Ovsyannikova has spoken to the BBC about her life after the protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina Ovsyannikova has spoken to the BBC about her life after the protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former <strong>Russian</strong> state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova\">interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova\">Ukraine</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova\"> war</a>, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia.</p> <p>Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war.

She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter.</p> <p>Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life.</p> <p>She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level.</p> <p>Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot of factors came together.

They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity.</p> <p>The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe.</p> <p>The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January.</p> <p>While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion.</p> <p>Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers.</p> <p>Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it.</p> <p>“We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.”</p> <p>The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period.</p> <p>Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms.</p> <p>You can read the full report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/ukrainian-refugees-increasingly-targeted-for-sexual-exploitation-research-finds\">here</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/ukrainian-refugees-increasingly-targeted-for-sexual-exploitation-research-finds\">Ukrainian refugees increasingly targeted for sexual exploitation, research finds</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-642005498f0893440cca187d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-03-26T09:13:14.005Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some images coming to us over the wires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41c66a730236ed0a9bb731373861459a420cfc60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41c66a730236ed0a9bb731373861459a420cfc60/0_550_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian serviceman is seen at their artillery position in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian serviceman is seen at their artillery position in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8433d8cb590168b7df066e8c1e091005fc37a936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8433d8cb590168b7df066e8c1e091005fc37a936/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk past an army recruiting billboard in St. Petersburg, Russia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk past an army recruiting billboard in St. Petersburg, Russia. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5c4c01638c050638d1a34deccfb22ec76eb2582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5c4c01638c050638d1a34deccfb22ec76eb2582/0_138_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A resident cleans debris of a recently shelled building in Avdiivka, Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A resident cleans debris of a recently shelled building in Avdiivka, Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-641ff6798f0893440cca1851\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-03-26T08:35:12.912Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289786d59b5d3e590645cd1266778763ed34aeb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289786d59b5d3e590645cd1266778763ed34aeb8/0_460_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, will attend the England v Ukraine football match at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, will attend the England v Ukraine football match at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denys Dreyzer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here’s some more on football.</p> <p>Later on Sunday,<strong> Ukraine</strong> take on <strong>England</strong> at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition.</p> <p>UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley.</p> <p>Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.</p> <p>He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home.</p> <p>Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford.

As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv <strong>Moscow</strong> kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise.</p> <p>There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia\">Russia</a></strong> from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw.</p> <p>Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace.</p> <p><strong>Russian</strong> money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties.</p> <p>On Sunday evening, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war.</p> <p>Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it.</p> <p>Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy.

But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country.</p> <p>Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits.</p> <p>“Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy.</p> <p>Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders.</p> <p>The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time.</p> <p>“We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement.</p> <p>“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.

Here is a summary of today’s events: Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to its neighbor Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday, according to AFP. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured following the explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, which law enforcement has attributed to a Ukrainian drone. “A Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV was the cause of an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk, Tula region,” the Tass news agency quoted a law enforcement agency source as saying, according to Reuters. “The drone was packed with explosives.” None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory, warning the move may trigger additional sanctions. In a Sunday tweet, Borrell said: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security.” “Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice,” he added. “The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” On Saturday, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement reached with Belarus will see Moscow stationing tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbors’ territory. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. More details are emerging about the reported explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, where two people suffered shrapnel wounds. The crater was caused by a drone, the Tass news agency quoted law enforcement as saying, Reuters reports. Three residential buildings were also damaged following the explosion, a regional security agency said. More reaction from Kyiv on plans by Russian president Vladimir Putin to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. The ministry said: Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation. It demanded a UN security council session and called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it accepts the Russian weapons. The Ukrainian statement added: Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons. Two people have suffered shrapnel wounds following an explosion on Sunday in the town of Kireyevsk, about 220km (140 miles) south of Moscow, the Tass news agency cited emergency services as saying. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but it left a crater in the centre of the town, in the Tula region, Reuters reports. “The explosion sounded at 1519 (1219 GMT). Two victims, born in 2002 and 2006, have shrapnel wounds. Emergency services are on the scene,” Tass quoted a local emergency services representative as saying. “There is a crater. This explosion was in the heart of the city,” the representative added. The representative said the injuries were not life-threatening and that investigators were working at the site. Several nearby buildings were damaged but no one was injured after a naval mine detonated after hitting some some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Ukraine fans have been gathering near Wembley, in north London, ahead of this evening’s UEFA Euro 2024 Group C qualifying match against England: It is just after 4pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of events so far. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports.

Ukraine has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council over Russia’s announcement that it would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said: Ukraine expects effective actions to counteract the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail from the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France... We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. A Nato spokesperson said on Sunday: Nato is vigilant, and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments, most recently suspending its participation in the New START Treaty. The Associated Press reports on a new recruitment campaign launched across Russia seeking volunteers to enlist troops for the war in Ukraine. Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed. A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits. A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations. The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old. But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him. “It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.” Former Russian state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the Ukraine war, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia. Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” At the time, she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for ignoring protest laws. She continued protesting against the war after quitting her job at Channel One. Last August, she was charged with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and placed under house arrest in Moscow, where she was to await trial. She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter. Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life. She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level. Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds. When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said: I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia. Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained: A lot of factors came together. Over a long time I realised that the Russian TV became like a gigantic brainwashing machine. Secondly, I have Ukrainian roots – my father is from Ukraine. It was like this huge emotional outburst. But I didn’t really care what would happen to me later.” Ovsyannikova had worked at the channel for nearly 20 years and admitted she had in the past “shut my eyes to it [the propaganda]”, but the war became “a point of no return”. She said: This propaganda is made on a very high level …These people who are working in the main media channels, they don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me, and also, you can say that people who are pro-Putin, who are convinced in him, as no more than 10 or 20%. The arrest warrant handed to President Putin by the international criminal court could herald change, she added: I think this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite and they might plot against him. At least this is some kind of hope for me. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak has accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. On Saturday, Putin announced Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus “without violating our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation”, Agence France-Presse reports. But Podolyak said on Twitter: Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics … Second. He once again states his involvement in the crime. Violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty … Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research. Thomson Reuters has conducted the research, which has found that Ukrainian refugees may be victims of both traffickers on the ground and cyber-voyeurs. Researchers identified an increased interest in Ukrainian pornography since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 by analysing global internet search engine traffic. They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity. The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe. The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January. While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion. Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers. Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it. “We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.” The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period. Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms. You can read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Here’s some more on football. Later on Sunday, Ukraine take on England at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition. UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley. Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home. Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford. His father is in Kyiv. Discussing the match, he told PA News: I hope it will be amazing, because it’s like new fresh air to our community to watch our guys fighting to get to the Euros. We hope this game our guys will show what we can do. And also it will be good present for our military, because they are every day fighting for our freedom. I hope they will watch this game and this game will will make them happy. The Azadi Stadium in Tehran can hold up to 78,000 at capacity. As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv Moscow kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise. There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for Russia from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw. Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace. Russian money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties. On Sunday evening, Ukraine’s footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war. Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it. Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy. The bottom line is, forget Russia.” Read the full report here. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast on Sunday, stating that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. Putin also said western powers were building a new “axis”, bearing some resemblance to Germany and Japan’s second world war alliance. Interfax quoted Putin as saying: We are not creating any military alliance with China. Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret. Kyiv on Sunday said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, wrote on Twitter, adding that the move was “a step towards the internal destabilisation of the country”. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023 Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. The head of the National Bank of Ukraine said that it had “created huge risks for macro-financial stability” when the bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia to plug a budget shortfall, adding that an “open conflict” with the government over the issue had been resolved. “It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,” Pyshnyi told the newspaper. Reactions continue on Vladimir Putin’s announcement Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. “It’s a very significant move,” Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told Reuters. “Russia had always been very proud that it had no nuclear weapons outside its territory. So, now, yes, they are changing that and it’s a big change.” Putin did not specify when the weapons would be transferred to Belarus, which has borders with three Nato members – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. He said Russia would complete the construction of a storage facility there by 1 July. “This is part of Putin’s game to try to intimidate Nato … because there is no military utility from doing this in Belarus as Russia has so many of these weapons and forces inside Russia,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement on an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The US – the world’s other nuclear superpower – has reacted cautiously to Russia’s deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. A senior US administration official says there are no signs Moscow plans to use its nuclear weapons. Putin likened his plans to the US stationing its weapons in Europe and said that Russia would not be transferring control to Belarus. But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country. Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits. “Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy. Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. “We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.” In other key developments shortly after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court.",

Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/ukraine-snubs-german-president-over-past-russia-links\">told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”.</a></p> <p>In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Denys_Shmyhal/status/1566362229125038082?s=20&amp;t=AcF98du0QShJycEBb5I0eQ\">tweet said</a>.</p> <p>Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side”, Steinmeier told Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokesperson. </p> <p>“Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2.</p> <p>Writing on Telegram, Shmyhal urged allies to provide Ukraine with more heavy weapons. “The MARS II multiple rocket launchers and the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled artillery units, which Germany has provided, have performed well on the battlefield,” he said, adding that he expected Germany to become one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine’s air defence. </p> <p>The rapprochement between Kyiv and Berlin came as Scholz declared that Germany “will get through this winter”, as his government announced on Sunday a €65bn (£56bn) package to help households and companies cope with soaring energy prices. Scholz told local media that Germany would use income from windfall taxes to reduce end-consumer prices for gas, coal and oil.</p> <p>Europe faces an energy crisis after Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/02/nord-stream-1-gazprom-announces-indefinite-shutdown-of-pipeline\">shut down gas flows</a> from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany. Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline – the largest gas pipeline to Europe with capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres a year – would be shut indefinitely because of a leak and would not restart until repairs were completed.

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine’s prime minister has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion while calling for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. Denys Shmyhal, who was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin on Sunday, is the most senior Ukrainian official to visit the German capital in months, since Kyiv accused the EU’s biggest economy of doing too little. Starting his Berlin trip, Shmyhal met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was blocked from visiting Kyiv in April because of his past advocacy of strong German-Russian ties. Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”. In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the tweet said. Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side”, Steinmeier told Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokesperson. “Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Writing on Telegram, Shmyhal urged allies to provide Ukraine with more heavy weapons. “The MARS II multiple rocket launchers and the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled artillery units, which Germany has provided, have performed well on the battlefield,” he said, adding that he expected Germany to become one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine’s air defence. The rapprochement between Kyiv and Berlin came as Scholz declared that Germany “will get through this winter”, as his government announced on Sunday a €65bn (£56bn) package to help households and companies cope with soaring energy prices. Scholz told local media that Germany would use income from windfall taxes to reduce end-consumer prices for gas, coal and oil. Europe faces an energy crisis after Russia shut down gas flows from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany. Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline – the largest gas pipeline to Europe with capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres a year – would be shut indefinitely because of a leak and would not restart until repairs were completed. Siemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment to Nord Stream 1, said the leak could be sealed and there was no reason to shut down the entire pipeline. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Moscow of weaponising its energy supplies against European countries it cannot yet attack with missiles. “Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent,” Zelenskiy said. “It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” The answer to this “decisive energy attack” was unity of European states and sanctions to limit Russia’s oil and gas revenues, he said. With the war in its 193rd day, Ukrainian officials said an eight-year-old child died and three other children were injured by Russian overnight shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv. Russian forces hit multiple residential targets in the region, according to Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv. Posting on his Telegram account, he said Russian shelling had damaged homes, three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum in the area. Zelenskiy urged the EU to deliver a promised €9bn emergency financial aid package “asap”, he reported on Sunday in a tweet about a phone call he had with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. So far the EU has released only €1bn of the total because of wrangling over the balance between grants and loans. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said last week he was confident the EU would soon meet its promise, although Ukraine needs an estimated €5bn a month to keep going. Ukraine’s prime minister said he expected €5bn in macrofinancial assistance from the EU this week, which will “help ensure the stability of our economy, support of the army and the passing of the heating season”. Concerns remained high over Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is relying on a reserve line to supply electricity to the grid. In a statement on Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the plant had again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but continued to supply electricity to the grid via a reserve line. The plant was occupied by Russian forces in March but remains connected to Ukraine’s electricity grid and run by Ukrainian staff. After mounting concern about nuclear disaster, the IAEA inspectors arrived at the plant last Thursday with the aim of establishing a permanent presence. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday that his country could play a facilitator role regarding the plant, Erdoğan’s office said.",

Ukrainians are locked into a mortal fight for their freedom and their liberty; the extraordinary bravery of its ordinary citizens should humble us all.

Just as he did in Syria, he appeared to make concessions for humanitarian corridors to be established from Mariupol and Volnovakha, to allow for the evacuation of civilians, only to rip up the terms of that ceasefire as soon as it had been agreed. Putin’s aim appears to be to break the morale of the Ukrainian people and to brutally terrorise them into surrender.</p> <p>There will be a time to go over the failings of the west that brought us to this dreadful point, where there seems to be no way for other democracies to avert a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; all they can do is to try to lessen the toll. For now, the most important question is what we can do to support Ukrainians and their democratically elected leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">President Zelenskiy,</a> in their fight and what we can do to limit the scale of the human catastrophe.</p> <p>There are actions the west can take that should not even be the subject of debate, yet on which the British government seems to be dragging its feet. Despite minor relaxations, the UK’s policy with respect to Ukrainian refugees remains far more restrictive than that of the EU. There are stories of families fleeing war who remain separated because of British bureaucracy and mean-spiritedness. This should be a source of national shame.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nato cannot declare war on Russia, which is what a no-fly zone would amount to.

But there is no justification for not clamping down swiftly and hard: these are people who have profited directly from Putin’s regime. Yesterday, the Italian government seized yachts and villas worth at least €140m from four Russians on the EU sanctions list. The UK government’s sluggishness is likely to prove costly in terms of allowing individuals to escape the sanctions they must face.</p> <p>These are the easier questions to answer about what actions the west must take. Far harder is what Nato should do to support Ukrainian forces and minimise civilian casualties in Ukraine itself.

                    "bodyText": "The world has watched in horror as Vladimir Putin has deployed the same tactics of indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Ukraine as he did in Syria and Chechnya. The power of despots derives from their willingness to inflict unthinkable evil to bend the will of those they seek to dominate and Putin is no different. Ukrainians are locked into a mortal fight for their freedom and their liberty; the extraordinary bravery of its ordinary citizens should humble us all. Yesterday’s bellicose rhetoric from the Russian leader, including his threat to dismantle Ukraine’s statehood, offers no suggestion of compromise. His war crimes are intensifying. Over the past week, we have seen civilians targeted with mass shellings. Densely populated cities have been under constant bombardment for days, as people hide in basements with dwindling supplies of food and water. Hospitals and kindergartens have been destroyed by the bombs. Whole families trying to flee the carnage have been shot in cold blood by Russian soldiers. In Volnovakha, shells hit civilian buildings every five minutes from a line of contact 20km away; barely a building in the town has been left unscathed. Bodies have been left in the streets; the peril facing those carrying out rescue missions is so great that they have to prioritise the living. Just as he did in Syria, Putin has ordered that key cities such as Mariupol should be besieged. Just as he did in Syria, he appeared to make concessions for humanitarian corridors to be established from Mariupol and Volnovakha, to allow for the evacuation of civilians, only to rip up the terms of that ceasefire as soon as it had been agreed. Putin’s aim appears to be to break the morale of the Ukrainian people and to brutally terrorise them into surrender. There will be a time to go over the failings of the west that brought us to this dreadful point, where there seems to be no way for other democracies to avert a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; all they can do is to try to lessen the toll. For now, the most important question is what we can do to support Ukrainians and their democratically elected leader, President Zelenskiy, in their fight and what we can do to limit the scale of the human catastrophe. There are actions the west can take that should not even be the subject of debate, yet on which the British government seems to be dragging its feet. Despite minor relaxations, the UK’s policy with respect to Ukrainian refugees remains far more restrictive than that of the EU. There are stories of families fleeing war who remain separated because of British bureaucracy and mean-spiritedness. This should be a source of national shame. Economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs may have limited direct effect on Putin on the short term. But there is no justification for not clamping down swiftly and hard: these are people who have profited directly from Putin’s regime. Yesterday, the Italian government seized yachts and villas worth at least €140m from four Russians on the EU sanctions list. The UK government’s sluggishness is likely to prove costly in terms of allowing individuals to escape the sanctions they must face. These are the easier questions to answer about what actions the west must take. Far harder is what Nato should do to support Ukrainian forces and minimise civilian casualties in Ukraine itself. Here, the UK has led the way on providing accurate intelligence and military supplies, but there is the ever-present question of what more there is to do. Nato cannot declare war on Russia, which is what a no-fly zone would amount to. This would be a reckless escalation of conflict with a nuclear power. But there are lessons the west must learn from Syria about effective military and humanitarian support in the face of Russian brutality. There must be more support for evacuating civilians, especially vulnerable adults and children, from cities not yet under siege. Cities should be flooded with humanitarian supplies and basic infrastructure, such as satellites and generators. Russian guarantees for humanitarian corridors cannot be relied upon. It is vital that war crimes are documented, not just in the interests of justice when the conflict is over, but to assist in negotiations for humanitarian access. Ukraine has reported that some of the anti-aircraft defence missiles it has received from Germany do not work, and has asked for more, a call that must be heeded. The bravery of the Ukrainian resistance will be remembered by generations to come: the people from all walks of life volunteering to defend their country; the unarmed protesters marching against their occupiers in Kherson, the only city the Russians have so far captured. Citizens of liberal democracies owe the people of Ukraine a debt of gratitude; they are at the frontline of the fight for freedom and democracy in the face of authoritarianism, for rights that most of us are complacent about. Russia’s strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station should serve as a reminder that they are more fragile than we would like to think.

Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The White House has pledged a new $1.58bn aid package to Ukraine and will send advanced Patriot missile batteries to the war-torn country, saying the assistance will be vital to stop Russia’s “barbaric” rocket attacks on critical infrastructure. Zelenskiy told a White House news conference that the weapons were “the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror – the possibility to hit our cities, our energy”. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February. The Biden administration also unveiled new curbs on technology exports to Russia’s Wagner military group. The group, a private military contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, will now be labelled a military end-user and face tough new curbs on access to technology made anywhere in the world with US equipment. The US under-secretary of commerce for industry and security, Alan Estevez, said the group was “actively committing atrocities and human rights abuses across Ukraine”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. “The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything.” Putin also gave his backing to a plan by his defence minister to boost the size of the armed forces by more than 30% to 1.5 million combat personnel. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The call-up drew strong criticism as new recruits were deemed to be physically unfit or too old and lacking basic equipment. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying.",

                    "bodyText": "The upper house of Russia’s parliament has voted to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, following a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house, yesterday. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed a decree formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to annex, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. On Monday, Putin’s spokesperson said the Kremlin would consult with residents of the areas it has “annexed” to determine where the borders should be, suggesting Russia does not know where its new self-declared international borders are. Putin has vowed to protect Russia’s newly claimed territories using “all means at its disposal”, indicating a potential nuclear strike. The lack of a clear red line may undermine his attempts at using nuclear deterrence to halt Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive and western support for Kyiv. Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, Zelenskiy confirmed on Monday, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday. “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” Lyman’s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia’s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine’s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russias’s ministry of defence spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro River “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people were injured on the territory it occupies, and 13 houses and 12 civil infrastructure were damaged by fire from the Ukrainian armed forces. More than 200,000 people have been called up for military service since Russia announced a “partial mobilisation” two weeks ago, according to the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. A Russian court has fined the streaming service Twitch 4m roubles (£60,000/$68,000) for failing to remove an interview with a Ukrainian political figure. The court said the interview violated Russian laws on the spreading of fake information. North Korea has become the only UN member state apart from Russia to recognise the “results” of the Moscow-backed “referendums” in the occupied areas of Ukraine. Diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan continue to deteriorate. Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi has ordered a Russian consul in Sapporo to leave Japan by 10 October. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said. The British government has said it has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Sergei Yeliseyev as part of its broader sanctions against Russia. Ukraine needs to revamp its labour laws and redouble efforts to privatise thousands of companies to repair its economy, its president’s economic adviser has said. Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Elon Musk has prompted an online row with Zelenskiy after he asked Twitter users to weigh in on his ideas to end Russia’s war. In a tweet, Musk suggested UN-supervised elections in four occupied regions that Moscow has falsely annexed after what it called referendums. Zelenskiy responded with his own poll. “Which @elonmusk do you like more?,” he wrote, offering two responses: one who supports Ukraine, or supports Russia. The Kremlin has praised the Tesla boss, with Kremlin spokesperson Peskov saying “It is very positive that somebody like Elon Musk is looking for a peaceful way out of this situation.” The US will deliver four more of the advanced rocket systems to Ukraine. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, will be part of a new $625m aid package to be announced on Tuesday, according to US officials. The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been released, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. Ihor Murashov was detained on Friday by a Russian patrol as he travelled from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the town of Enerhodar, according to the state-owned company in charge of the plant. Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest. The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin.",

He voted remain in the EU referendum Amuse bouche Jasper once had a pet turkey called George Bush Miles, 27, London Occupation Campaign organiser Voting record Mostly Conservative. Miles used to be the chair of his local Young Conservatives. In the EU referendum he wanted to vote leave but didn’t think it would be good for the City and foresaw problems with the Irish border Amuse bouche Miles says he once told Theresa May a joke: “I said the only problem with being a Tory is when you go on dates, you end up going home alone. She thought that was hilarious” For starters Jasper He seemed like a nice bloke. I was slightly surprised. I was expecting someone from a fee-paying school, maybe dressed in Harris tweed. He did say he considered wearing tweed. I think he was relieved I wasn’t some super-duper activist – he kept joking that I hadn’t glued myself to the table. Miles I was worried he was going to be a complete weirdo. We bonded over Wales. I’ve lived in London all my life, but my dad is from Cardiff. Jasper I thought I was middle-class in south Wales where I grew up, but when I moved to London, suddenly I wasn’t. I met a lot of quite posh people and I was the roughest person they’d met. Miles A teacher at school showed us an Ed Miliband speech and I just felt: you don’t get it, you don’t get people. One of his lines was: “Labour wants the best for Britain” and I thought: that sounds like someone who doesn’t leave north London, and someone has told him this is what people in the sticks want to hear. Jasper The current lot only have their self-interest at heart. People used to go into government because they wanted to serve their country. Now it seems they do it because they want to become multimillionaires afterwards. Or while they’re in office. The big beef Miles We should open the coalmines. Closing them permanently damaged communities; deindustrialisation in this country has made millions of people feel aimless and depressed. Opening the coalmines in the Welsh valleys isn’t going to make climate change any worse. Jasper That’s not forward-thinking if burning coal is going to be banned in 20 years. He talked about emissions in other countries, but we had the Industrial Revolution much earlier. Miles You can’t get countries like India and China to stick to targets – you can’t say they can’t grow their economies, get more people into cars, use electrical goods, etc. Jasper was in favour of flying less, changing our living habits to fight climate change. I said, “We need to focus at the top and build more nuclear power stations.” Jasper Miles supports the new Heathrow runway. Heathrow expansion is clearly a bad idea – we should be investing in trains. Sharing plate Miles We agreed on the need for proportional representation. And I agreed with him that all the levelling up is focusing on northern England, not Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. I’m in favour of any measure that will keep the union together. Jasper We both thought austerity was a tragedy. For many people I know, it’s one of the reasons they could never vote Conservative. For afters Miles I’m in favour of putting troops on the ground in Ukraine. It’s not just about Ukraine, it’s about Europe and about Russia’s worldview. It was basically a proxy attack on us, and we should have demonstrated to Putin that we knew that. Jasper I wouldn’t go and fight there. And I don’t think world war three is the best idea. There’s a risk of turning up and then pulling out like in Afghanistan, where it is flooded with weapons from the west and no one takes responsibility. It would be saturating Europe with arms. Takeaways Miles It’s useful to listen to people who can challenge your views and make you think a bit harder. Face-to-face is definitely more intense – you have to be challenging but gentle as well. Jasper My main takeaway was shock about his idea of sending the army into Ukraine. That overshadowed most things for me as I was walking home.

Gas prices in Europe were already soaring, owing, in part, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss\">Vladimir Putin’s tightening of gas supply to the EU</a> – a move that now seems a clear precursor to his invasion aims.</p> <p>Germany has announced a suite of new energy policies alongside its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/germany-set-up-fund-boost-military-strength-ukraine-putin\">historic foreign policy reversals</a>, and the country’s Green party – in the ruling coalition – is even reconsidering its implacable opposition to nuclear power. </p> <p>EU nations are ramping up their low-carbon energy efforts, and businesses have been affected too: earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/bp-exiting-its-1975-shareholding-in-russian-oil-giant-rosneft\">BP gave up its stake in Rosneft</a>, and on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/shell-to-exit-joint-ventures-with-gazprom-and-pull-out-of-nord-stream-2\">Shell did the same with Gazprom</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, the war has added impetus to the claims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/its-all-a-bit-cynical-the-politicians-behind-the-tory-attack-on-net-zero-agenda\">many Conservative politicians and rightwing commentators</a>, fuelled by soaring gas prices, that the UK must put off the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in favour of fostering domestic fossil fuel supplies.</p> <p>Kwarteng’s statements, in response to these issues, acknowledge that North Sea oil and gas are totemic for many opponents of the UK’s net zero plans – the UK’s own fossil fuel resources are seen as a bulwark against energy insecurity and economic threats. </p> <p>However, this overlooks the fact that much of the UK’s production of North Sea oil and gas is sold overseas to the highest bidder – in fact, the amount exported <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10455627/UK-gas-exports-double-year-millions-British-families-face-soaring-bills.html\">doubled late last year</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1498197284282064896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the UK has no gas supply issues.<br><br>The situation we are facing is a price issue, not a security of supply issue.<br> <br>Put simply: we have lots of gas from highly diverse and secure sources - but it is very expensive.<br><br>(2/9)</p>&mdash; Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1498197284282064896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The UK has no gas supply issues, but what Kwarteng carefully leaves out is that the UK certainly does have a gas storage issue. The Conservative government decided in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/uk-gas-storage-prices-rough-british-gas-centrica\">to allow the closure of major gas storage facilities</a>, meaning that the UK now has puny storage capacity compared with EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.

The Committee on Climate Change found last week that granting new licences to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea would do nothing to alleviate high prices, as those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/new-north-sea-oil-gas-licences-incompatible-uk-climate-goals\">new fields </a>would take decades to come into production. </p> <p>But although the CCC clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/north-sea-oil-exploration-should-not-proceed-but-can-says-uks-climate-committee\">“favoured” a moratorium on new licences</a>, the government’s response made clear it was minded to press ahead with them anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1498197287469789190\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The wholesale price of gas has *quadrupled* in UK and Europe. <br> <br>Additional UK production won’t materially affect the wholesale market price.<br> <br>This includes fracking – UK producers won’t sell shale gas to UK consumers below the market price.

In fact, apart from the short-lived green homes grant scheme, there has been no nationwide insulation programme for the last seven years, and meanwhile more than 1m new homes have been built to high-carbon standards, and will have to be retrofitted.</p> <p>Ed Matthew, of the thinktank E3G, says: “The business secretary is right to flag that energy efficiency investment is the best way to bring down energy bills.

                    "bodyText": "On Monday, as war in Ukraine caused turbulence in the European energy market, and just before the publication of the “bleakest warning yet” from scientists on the climate crisis, the UK’s secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, took to Twitter to set out his case for a clean energy future for the UK. It was a major intervention from the business secretary, at a vital juncture. Kwarteng is joining many of the biggest voices and leading experts in the UK energy industry in arguing for clean energy and rejecting fossil fuels. But this new emphasis from the government will need to be backed up by further policy and action if it is to mean real change. So what should we make of Kwarteng’s statements? The invasion of Ukraine has led to a huge upheaval of the energy markets, as the International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol predicted. Gas prices in Europe were already soaring, owing, in part, to Vladimir Putin’s tightening of gas supply to the EU – a move that now seems a clear precursor to his invasion aims. Germany has announced a suite of new energy policies alongside its historic foreign policy reversals, and the country’s Green party – in the ruling coalition – is even reconsidering its implacable opposition to nuclear power. EU nations are ramping up their low-carbon energy efforts, and businesses have been affected too: earlier this week BP gave up its stake in Rosneft, and on Monday Shell did the same with Gazprom. In the UK, the war has added impetus to the claims of many Conservative politicians and rightwing commentators, fuelled by soaring gas prices, that the UK must put off the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in favour of fostering domestic fossil fuel supplies. Kwarteng’s statements, in response to these issues, acknowledge that North Sea oil and gas are totemic for many opponents of the UK’s net zero plans – the UK’s own fossil fuel resources are seen as a bulwark against energy insecurity and economic threats. However, this overlooks the fact that much of the UK’s production of North Sea oil and gas is sold overseas to the highest bidder – in fact, the amount exported doubled late last year. The UK has no gas supply issues, but what Kwarteng carefully leaves out is that the UK certainly does have a gas storage issue. The Conservative government decided in 2017 to allow the closure of major gas storage facilities, meaning that the UK now has puny storage capacity compared with EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Being unable to store large quantities of gas makes the UK more dependent on imports and vulnerable to price shocks, like the current one. Kwarteng is absolutely right – but why then is he planning a big expansion of exploration in the North Sea? The Committee on Climate Change found last week that granting new licences to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea would do nothing to alleviate high prices, as those new fields would take decades to come into production. But although the CCC clearly “favoured” a moratorium on new licences, the government’s response made clear it was minded to press ahead with them anyway. Again, Kwarteng is right – those calling for a return to fracking as the answer to the UK’s energy problems are deluded. Fracking failed because the industrialisation of densely populated countryside for meagre returns was always a doubtful business in the UK. But it’s notable that Kwarteng, one of the authors of Britannia Unchained, chooses an entirely different argument to slap down the frackers – the fact that any gas produced would not reduce the market price. The UK led the dash for gas, and away from coal, in the 1990s, which is the main reason why UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen further and faster than many comparable developed countries over that time. But gas cannot be the long-term answer if we are to tackle the climate crisis. However, as the energy commentator Michael Liebreich also pointed out on Twitter on Monday, moving away from gas needs to be planned and carefully executed – otherwise, consumers will face price shocks. The UK could have ramped up renewable energy much sooner, but chose to rely on North Sea fossil fuels for much longer than necessary. Why does nuclear come first? Building new nuclear power stations will take even longer than new North Sea oil and gas fields, or new fracking wells. The only new nuclear power station currently being built in the UK, at Hinkley Point C in Somerset by French energy giant EDF, has taken the best part of two decades to move from planning to construction and is still years away from producing electricity. Financial backing for new nuclear is also in serious doubt, as critics say it is likely to be the most expensive form of generation. Again, Kwarteng is absolutely right: renewables are cheaper than gas. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. Why then has the UK made onshore windfarms almost impossible to build in England? Solar prices have also plummeted. So why has the government failed to mandate solar panels on new housing, and reduced the incentives available for households to install them? The case for energy efficiency is abundantly clear. The UK has the leakiest housing stock in Europe, so insulation will cut energy bills, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make people healthier. But since the scrapping of the ill-administered green homes grant last April, households across England have been left without any assistance scheme. In fact, apart from the short-lived green homes grant scheme, there has been no nationwide insulation programme for the last seven years, and meanwhile more than 1m new homes have been built to high-carbon standards, and will have to be retrofitted. Ed Matthew, of the thinktank E3G, says: “The business secretary is right to flag that energy efficiency investment is the best way to bring down energy bills. There is potential to cut UK home energy use in half with energy efficiency. “But the £6bn the government has committed is only half of the investment needed to get on track to net zero and reach the target to end fuel poverty by 2030. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder of the price we pay due to our addiction to gas. “For energy security, for net zero, for energy bills, the solution is the same – we need a bold new infrastructure programme to insulate every UK home within a decade and massively accelerate the switch to electrified heat. There is no greater patriotic mission.” Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, applauds Kwarteng’s intentions but says that the UK is coming at this from a slow start. “The government rightly identifies an expansion of renewables and home energy efficiency upgrades as important levers to move away from imported fossil gas,” he says. “Whilst on renewable energy the UK has achieved a lot and recent announcements of annual auctions are welcome, on energy efficiency the UK is trailing far behind its European neighbours. A well-funded, long-term energy efficiency programme is still nonexistent and this needs to change.” Nothing that Kwarteng says in this thread represents a departure in government policy. What’s important is that he has chosen to say it, at this time and in this way. He is not alone: Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over the Cop26 climate summit last year, has repeatedly called for more climate action. Other Conservatives are also joining the fray: Samuel Hall of the Conservative Environment Network told Darren Grimes on GB News on Monday that renewables would work better than fracking in bringing bills down. These interventions have come amid renewed concern over the UK’s energy future, sparked by the war in Ukraine. They also come as a belated riposte to attempts by the right wing of the Tory party to turn net zero into a culture war. For months now, almost as soon as the last delegate departed from Cop26 in Glasgow last November, the UK’s right-leaning press has been full of attacks on the government’s climate policy by the opponents of net zero. The wounding of Boris Johnson in the partygate scandals gave rightwing Conservatives and commentators the opening they needed, as the “green agenda” has long been closely identified with the prime minister. Soaring energy prices fanned the flames. For Kwarteng now to take such a public stand in favour of green energy, slapping down fracking enthusiasts and deflating claims for North Sea gas, marks a significant ramping up of green rhetoric. Perhaps the fightback starts here.",

In a phone interview from Delaware, he happily ruffles feathers by defending nuclear power, suggesting that democracies can learn lessons from autocracies and attacking the last sacred space on television: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/feb/26/creature-comfort-why-tv-nature-shows-are-good-for-mental-health\">the nature documentary</a>.</p> <p>“Some of these nature biodiversity documentaries can, in fact, create a problem because they lead to niche thinking,” he says. “They are good for some things like biodiversity conservation but they are not making the connections often that you need to do.”</p> <p>Indeed, the 48-year-old revels in complexity and loathes dumbing down – even if it means frustrating literary agents. “When I was writing the book, agents would ask me, ‘What’s your one argument?’ I’d say, ‘You know, I’m writing a book about earth systems, I can’t have one argument. I have to approach the issues with nuance.’ This is the problem we have, unfortunately, in terms of communication of environmental issues.”</p> <p>To illustrate the point, Ali cites predictions that Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will soon be so hot <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-that-could-become-unlivable-by-2100-climate-change-2019-2#summer-temperatures-in-dubai-could-reach-113-degrees-fahrenheit-after-2070-4\">that it will be uninhabitable</a>. “That is such a ludicrous statement from the point of view of looking at how humans have interacted with the environment,” he contends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97c52e68ba3b42a621b35e666b10121c406e156d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c52e68ba3b42a621b35e666b10121c406e156d/0_0_872_705/500.jpg\" alt=\"Saleem Ali\" width=\"500\" height=\"404\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saleem Ali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saleem Ali</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Most cities in the western world are uninhabitable in winter without infrastructure, including New York City or London – if you didn’t have heating you wouldn’t be able to survive or you could have a very short existence with hypothermia.</p> <p>“We have developed adaptive mechanisms so to say that Dubai would be uninhabitable in summer without air conditioning makes no sense from the point of view of earth systems. But it makes a good headline because people immediately start panicking and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s becoming so bad.’”</p> <p>Humanity will have to adapt, he argues, for example through different types of architecture and more subterranean dwellings. He believes this is the pragmatic way forward in responding to some climate crisis thresholds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/05/antarctica-ice-sheet-melting-global-heating-sea-level-rise-study\">that are now irreversible</a> – while still aggressively reducing dependence on fossil fuels and refusing to surrender to the worst-case scenario.</p> <p>“If we frame the conversation as, look, this is going to be a future which is not ideal, we wish we had not gone that pathway, we wish we had reduced emissions, but now we need to figure out what’s the best way to adapt to this new future, that would be much more constructive and realistic to work through with some of the people who have been climate deniers.</p> <p>“But it wouldn’t mean complacency. You still need a lot of action around it. That’s where I feel as though we’ve been remiss in attacking this issue.”</p> <p>Ali is among the voices who contend that nuclear power, long anathema to many on the left, deserves a second look. It currently provides <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-nuclear-power-environment-and-nature-cfb21ab68a9e7005cc08873f2a5a7031\">about a fifth of electricity in the US</a>, accounting for about half the country’s carbon-free energy, and some companies – including one started by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates – are developing smaller, cheaper reactors that could supplement the grid.</p> <p>But the US has no long-term plan for managing or disposing of radioactive waste that can persist in the environment for thousands of years. Nuclear disasters at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, Chernobyl in Ukraine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima in Japan</a> have cast a long shadow. Although countries such as France are sticking with the technology or planning to build more plants, others, including Germany, are phasing out their reactors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be374b9adeb1fab7a3c6cdd86d033cc95e8a7e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be374b9adeb1fab7a3c6cdd86d033cc95e8a7e5f/0_102_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following a strong earthquake in March 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following a strong earthquake in March 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KYODO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ali argues: “There has been a completely emotional kneejerk response to Fukushima, especially in Germany, which they are realising now was a mistake. If you look at the actual science in terms of the natural order of how energy is extracted from materials, nuclear energy is the most energy-dense resource.</p> <p>“If you look at the data in terms of the the morbidity and mortality of Fukushima, you had not a single person die of radiation exposure; they died of the tsunami. The <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/\">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> published a report last year which showed that there were no cancer clusters around there either. And yet you had an entire energy policy recrafted. That is why Germany is in this dependency situation.”</p> <p>Indeed, Ali does not believe that western democracies have all the right answers. He suggests that for decades their leaders have been talking about climate in a fashion that is too narrow, failing to join dots in the public imagination. He is donating all royalties from the book to environmental literacy programmes in developing countries.</p> <p>“There was a strategic mistake made in terms of framing it just as climate change. I always like, with my students, to talk about global environmental change. We’re talking about many aspects of the global system which are changing. When people think of climate change, immediately it is just resonating as, ‘Oh, are we getting more heat or cold?’</p> <p>“That’s not really what’s going on. We’re talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/17/global-water-crisis-will-intensify-with-climate-breakdown-says-report\">water scarcity</a>. We’re talking about the ways in which energy is going to be delivered. If we had framed the conversation around global environmental change, it would have been easier to be able to figure out all of these interconnections.”</p> <p>Ali, who has a PhD in environmental planning, continues: “We assume that democratic systems are going to be able to deliver efficient outcomes but the reality is democratic systems are often very short-term-oriented because they are driven by election cycles.</p> <p>“We have the same problem with reference to even business decision making, especially publicly traded companies which are driven by quarterly earnings reports. When you’re talking about long-range impacts, there is definitely a disconnect between both aspects.</p> <p>“We threw the baby out with the bathwater when we started to lobby against planning. ‘Planning’ had these connotations that it was going back to somehow centrally planned economies but you need a certain bureaucracy to continue the planning programmes and we needed to have planning independent of the political apparatus. That’s been another reason why, unfortunately, we have ended up in this current impasse with climate change.”</p> <p>Do autocracies, which Joe Biden warns are locked in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3521187-does-bidens-democracy-v-autocracy-framework-make-sense/\">a global struggle with democracies</a>, do it better? Ali, whose book draws a contrast between China and India, says: “China is going to have problems in terms of their dependence on coal but there is definitely a much more technically oriented approach to decision making in China. Even if you take out the part about the central planning, the Confucian approach has been much more around let’s bring technocracy to the mix.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd215bc28112cf03ab9a5a6f117b819b5a4a9ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd215bc28112cf03ab9a5a6f117b819b5a4a9ad5/0_227_4924_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Fuxing bullet train in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Fuxing bullet train in south-west China’s Tibet autonomous region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Public transport in a classic example, he believes, with China deciding to switch from planes to trains as the dominant mode between major cities and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-high-speed-rail-cmd/index.html\">getting it done within a decade</a>. “Here in the US we’re stuck with Amtrak, which they have still not been able to change because there isn’t this sense of let’s work through all of the technical details and make it happen based on those decisions.</p> <p>“That’s also linked to the fact we have a very litigious culture that makes it very challenging to be able to develop new projects. Unfortunately, in current democracies the actual process of getting feedback and stakeholder engagement and litigation becomes an end in itself. There is just no point at which you draw the line and say, OK, now we have to move forward.”</p> <p>This, he continues, is one of the reasons that the outsider businessman Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/how-did-donald-trump-win-analysis\">was an attractive proposition</a> to millions of frustrated voters in the 2016 presidential election. “People saw that at least there was this willingness to make a decision. Much as I lament many aspects of his policies – building the wall – there was a decision.</p> <p>“In environmental discourse, we often talk about <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240435/\">the precautionary principle</a>, that you have to be careful about things, but if you go to the extreme, it becomes paralysis because you can’t make any kind of forward movement. That’s the main problem we have had.”</p> <p>But no, Ali is not calling for dictatorship in America, as he insists: “Democracies can correct that. I don’t see this as being something that only autocracies can do. We just need democracies to be made more efficient and form processes where decisions are based on technical knowledge and, after a certain point, that technical knowledge should trump – for want of a better word – negotiations.”</p> <p>By Ali’s lights, environmental awareness is no longer enough; environmental literacy is critical to the survival of the planet. Or as he puts it: “Depth in understanding of complexity is essential for functional order on Earth.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/earthly-order-9780197640272?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life</a> is out on 15 July</p></li> </ul>",

                    "bodyText": "Saleem Ali – whose Twitter bio begins “Mercurial Professor” – is not trying to be the new Stephen Hawking. “People buy all these theoretical physics books in droves because they think having them on the shelves will make them look smart,” opines the distinguished professor of energy and the environment at the University of Delaware. “A Brief History of Time is a very difficult book to read.” Ali believes his own, anecdote-filled book is far more accessible. Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between politics and science, drawing on his experience as a National Geographic field explorer who has worked in more than 150 countries. Ali has three passports, having been born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, moved to Pakistan aged nine and lived in Australia for several years. In a phone interview from Delaware, he happily ruffles feathers by defending nuclear power, suggesting that democracies can learn lessons from autocracies and attacking the last sacred space on television: the nature documentary. “Some of these nature biodiversity documentaries can, in fact, create a problem because they lead to niche thinking,” he says. “They are good for some things like biodiversity conservation but they are not making the connections often that you need to do.” Indeed, the 48-year-old revels in complexity and loathes dumbing down – even if it means frustrating literary agents. “When I was writing the book, agents would ask me, ‘What’s your one argument?’ I’d say, ‘You know, I’m writing a book about earth systems, I can’t have one argument. I have to approach the issues with nuance.’ This is the problem we have, unfortunately, in terms of communication of environmental issues.” To illustrate the point, Ali cites predictions that Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will soon be so hot that it will be uninhabitable. “That is such a ludicrous statement from the point of view of looking at how humans have interacted with the environment,” he contends. “Most cities in the western world are uninhabitable in winter without infrastructure, including New York City or London – if you didn’t have heating you wouldn’t be able to survive or you could have a very short existence with hypothermia. “We have developed adaptive mechanisms so to say that Dubai would be uninhabitable in summer without air conditioning makes no sense from the point of view of earth systems. But it makes a good headline because people immediately start panicking and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s becoming so bad.’” Humanity will have to adapt, he argues, for example through different types of architecture and more subterranean dwellings. He believes this is the pragmatic way forward in responding to some climate crisis thresholds that are now irreversible – while still aggressively reducing dependence on fossil fuels and refusing to surrender to the worst-case scenario. “If we frame the conversation as, look, this is going to be a future which is not ideal, we wish we had not gone that pathway, we wish we had reduced emissions, but now we need to figure out what’s the best way to adapt to this new future, that would be much more constructive and realistic to work through with some of the people who have been climate deniers. “But it wouldn’t mean complacency. You still need a lot of action around it. That’s where I feel as though we’ve been remiss in attacking this issue.” Ali is among the voices who contend that nuclear power, long anathema to many on the left, deserves a second look. It currently provides about a fifth of electricity in the US, accounting for about half the country’s carbon-free energy, and some companies – including one started by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates – are developing smaller, cheaper reactors that could supplement the grid. But the US has no long-term plan for managing or disposing of radioactive waste that can persist in the environment for thousands of years. Nuclear disasters at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan have cast a long shadow. Although countries such as France are sticking with the technology or planning to build more plants, others, including Germany, are phasing out their reactors. Ali argues: “There has been a completely emotional kneejerk response to Fukushima, especially in Germany, which they are realising now was a mistake. If you look at the actual science in terms of the natural order of how energy is extracted from materials, nuclear energy is the most energy-dense resource. “If you look at the data in terms of the the morbidity and mortality of Fukushima, you had not a single person die of radiation exposure; they died of the tsunami. The International Atomic Energy Agency published a report last year which showed that there were no cancer clusters around there either. And yet you had an entire energy policy recrafted. That is why Germany is in this dependency situation.” Indeed, Ali does not believe that western democracies have all the right answers. He suggests that for decades their leaders have been talking about climate in a fashion that is too narrow, failing to join dots in the public imagination. He is donating all royalties from the book to environmental literacy programmes in developing countries. “There was a strategic mistake made in terms of framing it just as climate change. I always like, with my students, to talk about global environmental change. We’re talking about many aspects of the global system which are changing. When people think of climate change, immediately it is just resonating as, ‘Oh, are we getting more heat or cold?’ “That’s not really what’s going on. We’re talking about water scarcity. We’re talking about the ways in which energy is going to be delivered. If we had framed the conversation around global environmental change, it would have been easier to be able to figure out all of these interconnections.” Ali, who has a PhD in environmental planning, continues: “We assume that democratic systems are going to be able to deliver efficient outcomes but the reality is democratic systems are often very short-term-oriented because they are driven by election cycles. “We have the same problem with reference to even business decision making, especially publicly traded companies which are driven by quarterly earnings reports. When you’re talking about long-range impacts, there is definitely a disconnect between both aspects. “We threw the baby out with the bathwater when we started to lobby against planning. ‘Planning’ had these connotations that it was going back to somehow centrally planned economies but you need a certain bureaucracy to continue the planning programmes and we needed to have planning independent of the political apparatus. That’s been another reason why, unfortunately, we have ended up in this current impasse with climate change.” Do autocracies, which Joe Biden warns are locked in a global struggle with democracies, do it better? Ali, whose book draws a contrast between China and India, says: “China is going to have problems in terms of their dependence on coal but there is definitely a much more technically oriented approach to decision making in China. Even if you take out the part about the central planning, the Confucian approach has been much more around let’s bring technocracy to the mix.” Public transport in a classic example, he believes, with China deciding to switch from planes to trains as the dominant mode between major cities and getting it done within a decade. “Here in the US we’re stuck with Amtrak, which they have still not been able to change because there isn’t this sense of let’s work through all of the technical details and make it happen based on those decisions. “That’s also linked to the fact we have a very litigious culture that makes it very challenging to be able to develop new projects. Unfortunately, in current democracies the actual process of getting feedback and stakeholder engagement and litigation becomes an end in itself. There is just no point at which you draw the line and say, OK, now we have to move forward.” This, he continues, is one of the reasons that the outsider businessman Donald Trump was an attractive proposition to millions of frustrated voters in the 2016 presidential election. “People saw that at least there was this willingness to make a decision. Much as I lament many aspects of his policies – building the wall – there was a decision. “In environmental discourse, we often talk about the precautionary principle, that you have to be careful about things, but if you go to the extreme, it becomes paralysis because you can’t make any kind of forward movement. That’s the main problem we have had.” But no, Ali is not calling for dictatorship in America, as he insists: “Democracies can correct that. I don’t see this as being something that only autocracies can do. We just need democracies to be made more efficient and form processes where decisions are based on technical knowledge and, after a certain point, that technical knowledge should trump – for want of a better word – negotiations.” By Ali’s lights, environmental awareness is no longer enough; environmental literacy is critical to the survival of the planet. Or as he puts it: “Depth in understanding of complexity is essential for functional order on Earth.” Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is out on 15 July",

Putin preparing for major new offensive in new year Senior Ukrainian officials say Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, Isobel Koshiw and Peter Beaumont reported, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia’s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive. Reznikov’s comments echoed similar remarks made to the Economist this week – including from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the head of the armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and the chief of ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskii. The briefings appeared to be part of a broad, coordinated effort to warn against complacency among western allies and highlight the continuing threat Russia poses to Ukraine. Deadlocked enemy forces slog it out in ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ Ukraine’s current defining battle is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. A widespread assessment that Russian forces have until mid-December before the onset of full winter conditions forces a slowing of their efforts has supplied one motive for the sense of urgency, Peter Beaumont writes from the region. A recent assessment for the Institute for the Study of War determined that even if Russia succeeded in a controlled Ukrainian withdrawal from the city, Bakhmut itself offered them little operational benefit. “The costs associated with six months of brutal, grinding and attrition-based combat around Bakhmut far outweigh any operational advantage that the Russians can obtain from taking Bakhmut.” Safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hangs in balance The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River – and a view of Europe’s biggest nuclear power station on the other bank. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. Julian Borger had this report. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal a win for Moscow? The Russian arms dealer is back in Moscow after the prisoner swap for US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner. Kremlin officials say it’s a “capitulation by America” – but others believe Bout is a declining asset. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal really a win for Moscow? Andrew Roth asked this week. Both Russia and Bout had long denied suspicions that he was an asset for the Russian spy services, and in his first remarks after arriving, Bout seemed to nod and wink at the belief that he held some secret value for the Kremlin. “I don’t think I’m somehow important for Russian politics,” he said, before adding a line now common in Russian war films and military circles: “We don’t abandon our own, right?” Russians connected to the Kremlin have treated the swap as greatly advantageous but analysts gave a more careful evaluation, noting that Bout has already served more than a decade in prison and most of his contacts and knowledge will have withered with time.

His remarks came just days after he appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Crimea is Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s greatest bargaining chip This week, Patrick Wintour took a look at the differing views on how Ukraine might approach the question of Crimea. In a little noticed intervention, the former British prime minister Boris Johnson – seen as a bosom ally of Volodymyr Zelenskiy – made the startling statement that if Russian troops were returned to lands they held inside Ukraine before the 24 February invasion, that would represent a basis for reopening talks between Ukraine and Russia. The statement implies Ukraine would have to accept that the removal of Russian troops from Crimea would not be a precondition for the start of talks. In proposing this, in a piece last week in the Wall Street Journal, Johnson was making an admission made in private by many diplomats that a militarily enforced return of the Crimean peninsula – which was annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move rejected by the UN – to full Ukrainian control is fraught with risk. Historically and ethnically, Crimea is different from the rest of Ukraine, the argument goes. There are also 30,000 Russian forces dug in with little available Ukrainian amphibious access. Crimea’s retention in some form is so precious to Vladimir Putin that if he felt it were slipping from his grasp, some fear he may act on his threat to deploy tactical nuclear weapons – the escalation that terrifies, and holds back, Washington and Europe. Moldovans weigh political future as Ukraine war hits economy Electricity blackouts, stray missiles and 35% inflation: collateral damage from Russia’s war on Ukraine has plunged neighbouring Moldova into a crisis that goes beyond higher energy bills. “I see elderly people crying in front of the shop window.

                    "bodyText": "South Korea and the US have fired eight surface-to-surface missiles into the sea in response to North Korea’s launch of a similar number of ballistic missiles the previous day, a South Korea defence ministry official said. South Korea said Monday’s tit-for-tat launch off its east coast was a demonstration of Seoul’s “capability and readiness to carry out precision strikes” against the source of North Korea’s missile launches or the command and support centres, the Yonhap news agency cited the South Korean military as saying. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has vowed to take a tougher line against the North and agreed with Joe Biden at a summit in Seoul last month to upgrade joint military drills and their combined deterrence posture, including the deployment of more powerful US weapons. On Monday, Yoon said the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes had reached a level where they “threatened regional and world peace”, and promised a “firm and stern response” to any future provocations. The militaries of South Korea and the US fired eight missiles over a period of about 10 minutes starting at 4.45am, Yonhap said. US Forces Korea said in a statement that the exercise had involved one US army missile and seven South Korean army missiles. It said the countries’ alliance “remains committed to peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific. The US commitment to the defence of [South Korea] remains ironclad.” North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast on Sunday, a day after the US aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan concluded a three-day naval exercise with South Korea in the Philippine Sea, apparently their first joint drill involving a carrier since November 2017. The South’s military said it had detected the North firing the missiles over a 35-minute period from at least four different locations, in what appeared to be a single-day record for the regime’s ballistic launches. North Korea, which is several weeks into battling its first known outbreak of Covid-19, has criticised previous joint drills as proof of Washington’s continued “hostile policies” toward Pyongyang, despite its talk of resuming nuclear diplomacy. Pyongyang has not commented on its recent missile tests and appears to be focusing on its Covid-19 response for the domestic audience, but it is continuing to modernise its military, according to Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. While the regime has not yet demonstrated miniaturised nuclear warheads, missiles with multiple warheads, or warhead reentry capability, even launches of short-range missile launches can provide valuable lessons, he said. “Firing many projectiles at once from various locations suggests Pyongyang is practicing to overwhelm South Korea’s missile defences,” Easley said, adding that the US and South Korea had “quickly responded to the Kim regime’s recent missile firings with counter-launches that demonstrate combined readiness for precision strikes against the origin of an attack”. North Korea has conducted a flurry of missile launches this year, from hypersonic weapons to intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM], for the first time in nearly five years. Washington and Seoul officials also recently warned that North Korea appeared ready to resume nuclear weapons tests for the first time since 2017, as Kim attempts to push his country’s status as a genuine nuclear power to win economic and security concessions from the US. Last month, North Korea fired three missiles, including one thought to be its largest ICBM, after Biden ended his three-day trip to South Korea, where he and Yoon agreed to new measures to deter the regime. The combined forces of South Korea and the US also fired missiles in response to those tests, which the two allies said violated UN security council resolutions.",

Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the bank’s emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/three-former-barclays-executives-found-not-guilty-of-fraud\">not guilty in early 2020</a>. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding – a subsidiary of the QIA – a total of $387m (£347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company.</p> \n<p>While Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a £50bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani.</p> \n<p>Other dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid £382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at £14,000.</p> \n<p>The state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group – which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic – has not yet paid a dividend this year. </p> \n<p>The QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Sainsbury’s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury’s staff.</p> \n<p>Reckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. “We have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.”</p> \n<p>Shell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. “A commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.”</p> \n<p>Those dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank.</p> \n<p>In December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending £85m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/qatar-backs-uks-rolls-royce-small-nuclear-power-project-2021-12-20/\">known as Rolls-Royce SMR.</a></p> \n<p>QInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a96654dc-a199-3d41-ba01-ced30d49e376\">43% stake in stockbroker</a> and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83e3c5e4-407a-40f0-8e8d-79a23fca9a61\">first profit in three years</a> in 2021.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for <a href=\"https://www.baesystems.com/en-uk/article/bae-systems-announces-agreement-to-support-qatar-emiri-naval-forces-naval-base-and-warships\">the Qatar Emiri’s Naval Force. </a>And amid the UK’s energy crisis, Qatar’s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus.

                    "bodyText": "Some of the UK’s largest listed companies including water and energy giants have handed almost £500m to Qatari state-owned investors this year, raising concerns that blue-chip company profits are supporting the controversial World Cup host. The dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nation’s investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries. The figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November. However, the Qatari state’s income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010. The figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure. Although the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms. Amnesty International UK’s director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts. “Qatar’s considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities,” Frankental said. “UK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatar’s notorious construction sites.” Qatar’s $450bn (£389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell. UK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIA’s equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authority’s equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn. Those UK stakes have meant that the investment authority – and therefore the Qatari state – have benefited from British companies’ profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Guardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around £475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup. That includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the QIA earned £13m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts – including £3.9m for its boss Liv Garfield – even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries.

A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal. One of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding – a subsidiary of the QIA – a total of $387m (£347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company. While Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a £50bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. Other dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid £382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at £14,000. The state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group – which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic – has not yet paid a dividend this year. The QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment. Sainsbury’s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury’s staff. Reckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. “We have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.” Shell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. “A commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.” Those dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank. In December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending £85m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR. QInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021. Meanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiri’s Naval Force. And amid the UK’s energy crisis, Qatar’s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal. Qatar is one of the UK’s largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared.",

                    "body": "<p>The policy focus of a Truss prime ministership will, inevitably, be largely a work in progress, given she is taking office amid a hugely turbulent economic period. But during a long leadership campaign the new PM has set out a series of proposals and plans for government:</p> \n<h2>Taxation and cost of living</h2> \n<p>Truss’s clear economic priority is to cut taxes, a move she insists will reboot a stalled economy and help people with soaring energy bills. She has promised to reverse the recent increase in national insurance and to cancel a scheduled rise in corporation tax, at a combined cost of about £30bn a year. Truss’s team has also mooted the idea of slashing VAT by 5% or cutting income tax to help household budgets.</p> \n<p>While Truss has said her plans would be paid for by fiscal headroom and delaying the repayment of Covid-related debts, critics have argued she will need to borrow considerable sums, at potentially expensive rates, at some cost to the economy. One option could be to expand a windfall tax on energy firms, but Truss has said she dislikes this.</p> \n<p>There is also considerable scepticism about a tax cut-based response to the energy costs crisis, which would disproportionately benefit high earners and do nothing for those reliant on pensions or benefits. Truss has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/07/penny-mordaunt-denies-liz-truss-is-ruling-out-more-help-for-poor-this-winter\">not ruled out</a> more direct help over energy bills, but has refused to say explicity what this might be, and talked about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/06/liz-truss-handouts-cost-of-living-crisis-tax-cuts-conservative-leadership\">distaste for “handouts”</a>. It is a position that is about to be tested against economic reality.</p> \n<h2>Climate and green energy</h2> \n<p>While Truss has stressed her commitment to the UK’s existing net zero target, and her team insists she will focus on renewable energy, some on the greener side of the Conservative party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy\">are becoming worried</a> about her priorities.</p> \n<p>One of Truss’s few direct policies on the cost of living would be to suspend green levies on energy bills, which are used to invest in renewable schemes. She opposes onshore wind, and described seeing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1557798867940397056\">solar farms on farmland</a> as “one of the most depressing sights” of modern Britain.</p> \n<p>In contrast, she supports fracking for shale gas and reportedly wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/30/liz-truss-oil-drilling-tory-leadership-energy\">see a push for new drilling</a> in the North Sea, and has backed a major expansion of nuclear power. She has not talked about efforts to reduce energy consumption, such as subsidising insulation for homes.</p> \n<h2>Health and social care</h2> \n<p>Truss has received relatively little scrutiny over her plans for the NHS and care, especially given the crisis in the health service, and the widespread expectation things will get much worse into the winter.</p> \n<p>While she remains committed to existing plans to support the NHS, there is the issue that Truss has promised to reverse the national insurance rise aimed at providing cash firstly to help clear the Covid-exacerbated backlog of NHS procedures, and in the longer term to pay for better social care.</p> \n<p>Much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/appalling-waits-for-ambulances-in-england-leaving-lives-at-risk\">problems with delayed ambulances</a> are because hospital beds are filled with people unable to access social care. Truss will need a coherent plan, and soon.</p> \n<h2>Levelling up</h2> \n<p>This is another area on which Truss said relatively little during the leadership campaign but could increase in significance as she faces the country, and her own MPs, as prime minister.</p> \n<p>Levelling up was Boris Johnson’s self-stated defining purpose, and while Truss has said she remains committed to this agenda, it is unclear whether she would back this with significant spending. Truss has said she will level up “in a Conservative way”, seen as a focus more on deregulation and tax cuts.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons Johnson was popular with many “red wall” Tory MPs was that they could point to specific, Whitehall-financed infrastructure projects, whether a new local bypass or a revamped high street. If Truss was to take this away, it could create disquiet.</p> \n<h2>Immigration and home affairs</h2> \n<p>During the campaign, Truss has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/24/rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss-vow-dramatic-expansion-of-rwanda-asylum-scheme\">promised to double down</a> on the policy of deporting asylum seekers and other immigrants to Rwanda, and to seek other countries who will take them. It remains to be seen how feasible this is, or if it would have any impact on the numbers of people crossing the Channel by unofficial means, even if some did depart.</p> \n<p>Truss is likely to link any failure to remove people to the continued jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. While removing the UK entirely from its oversight would be complex and tricky, she is likely to push ahead with plans for a so-called UK bill of rights, with fewer protections for asylum seekers and others.</p> \n<h2>Culture wars</h2> \n<p>Truss is more of a keen amateur culture warrior than a die-hard aficionado, keeping the Tory faithful happy at hustings events with passing swipes at “woke” culture and trans rights. However, if as tipped she appoints Suella Braverman as home secretary and Kemi Badenoch to education, the temperature could rise considerably.</p> \n<p>Culture war issues tend to be more focused on seeking debate and political dividing lines than actual policies, but particularly in education it could lead to changes in approach, for example on trans rights and free speech.</p> \n<h2>Foreign policy and Brexit</h2> \n<p>Wider foreign policy is likely to be more of the same, given Truss led on this under Johnson, so expect more vehement support for Ukraine, plus occasional gaffes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/serious-problem-if-france-and-uk-cant-tell-if-they-are-friends-or-enemies-says-macron-liz-truss\">her recent refusal</a> to say whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a neighbour and close ally, is a “friend or foe”.</p> \n<p>Truss has made much of her toughness over the Northern Ireland protocol, and her camp has hinted she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/26/liz-truss-may-trigger-article-16-days-after-becoming-pm-amid-brexit-row\">could trigger article 16</a>, the emergency procedure clause in the post-Brexit deal with the EU, within days of entering No 10. But with so many other crises to face, and the leadership contest over, Truss might decide a potential trade war is not what she needs as well.</p>",

                    "bodyText": "The policy focus of a Truss prime ministership will, inevitably, be largely a work in progress, given she is taking office amid a hugely turbulent economic period. But during a long leadership campaign the new PM has set out a series of proposals and plans for government: Taxation and cost of living Truss’s clear economic priority is to cut taxes, a move she insists will reboot a stalled economy and help people with soaring energy bills. She has promised to reverse the recent increase in national insurance and to cancel a scheduled rise in corporation tax, at a combined cost of about £30bn a year. Truss’s team has also mooted the idea of slashing VAT by 5% or cutting income tax to help household budgets. While Truss has said her plans would be paid for by fiscal headroom and delaying the repayment of Covid-related debts, critics have argued she will need to borrow considerable sums, at potentially expensive rates, at some cost to the economy. One option could be to expand a windfall tax on energy firms, but Truss has said she dislikes this. There is also considerable scepticism about a tax cut-based response to the energy costs crisis, which would disproportionately benefit high earners and do nothing for those reliant on pensions or benefits. Truss has not ruled out more direct help over energy bills, but has refused to say explicity what this might be, and talked about her distaste for “handouts”. It is a position that is about to be tested against economic reality. Climate and green energy While Truss has stressed her commitment to the UK’s existing net zero target, and her team insists she will focus on renewable energy, some on the greener side of the Conservative party are becoming worried about her priorities. One of Truss’s few direct policies on the cost of living would be to suspend green levies on energy bills, which are used to invest in renewable schemes. She opposes onshore wind, and described seeing solar farms on farmland as “one of the most depressing sights” of modern Britain. In contrast, she supports fracking for shale gas and reportedly wants to see a push for new drilling in the North Sea, and has backed a major expansion of nuclear power. She has not talked about efforts to reduce energy consumption, such as subsidising insulation for homes. Health and social care Truss has received relatively little scrutiny over her plans for the NHS and care, especially given the crisis in the health service, and the widespread expectation things will get much worse into the winter. While she remains committed to existing plans to support the NHS, there is the issue that Truss has promised to reverse the national insurance rise aimed at providing cash firstly to help clear the Covid-exacerbated backlog of NHS procedures, and in the longer term to pay for better social care. Much of the problems with delayed ambulances are because hospital beds are filled with people unable to access social care. Truss will need a coherent plan, and soon. Levelling up This is another area on which Truss said relatively little during the leadership campaign but could increase in significance as she faces the country, and her own MPs, as prime minister. Levelling up was Boris Johnson’s self-stated defining purpose, and while Truss has said she remains committed to this agenda, it is unclear whether she would back this with significant spending. Truss has said she will level up “in a Conservative way”, seen as a focus more on deregulation and tax cuts. One of the reasons Johnson was popular with many “red wall” Tory MPs was that they could point to specific, Whitehall-financed infrastructure projects, whether a new local bypass or a revamped high street. If Truss was to take this away, it could create disquiet. Immigration and home affairs During the campaign, Truss has promised to double down on the policy of deporting asylum seekers and other immigrants to Rwanda, and to seek other countries who will take them. It remains to be seen how feasible this is, or if it would have any impact on the numbers of people crossing the Channel by unofficial means, even if some did depart. Truss is likely to link any failure to remove people to the continued jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. While removing the UK entirely from its oversight would be complex and tricky, she is likely to push ahead with plans for a so-called UK bill of rights, with fewer protections for asylum seekers and others. Culture wars Truss is more of a keen amateur culture warrior than a die-hard aficionado, keeping the Tory faithful happy at hustings events with passing swipes at “woke” culture and trans rights. However, if as tipped she appoints Suella Braverman as home secretary and Kemi Badenoch to education, the temperature could rise considerably. Culture war issues tend to be more focused on seeking debate and political dividing lines than actual policies, but particularly in education it could lead to changes in approach, for example on trans rights and free speech. Foreign policy and Brexit Wider foreign policy is likely to be more of the same, given Truss led on this under Johnson, so expect more vehement support for Ukraine, plus occasional gaffes such as her recent refusal to say whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a neighbour and close ally, is a “friend or foe”. Truss has made much of her toughness over the Northern Ireland protocol, and her camp has hinted she could trigger article 16, the emergency procedure clause in the post-Brexit deal with the EU, within days of entering No 10. But with so many other crises to face, and the leadership contest over, Truss might decide a potential trade war is not what she needs as well.",

They’ve heard the evidence. Do they take it on board?” Carrington said. The commission’s final report will be handed down by 4 October. Guardian Australia understands a further hearing is being considered on 18 August, with plans under way to determine the witnesses and location. A QPS spokesperson says all the inquiry’s recommendations will be “thoroughly considered” and police remain “committed to refining and enhancing” responses to domestic violence. Advocates are in firm agreement that any recommendations to come out of the inquiry need to more than a tokenistic or “Band-Aid” approach. As an advocate for specialist domestic violence police stations, Carrington hopes the commission will suggest their introduction following recommendations from coronial inquests into Doreen Langham and Hannah Clarke and her children. Moulding believes police training must be accompanied by “structural changes” such as police hiring more women in positions of power. Taylor hopes for “strong, sustainable” change. “You had to have the inquiry to shine the light,” Taylor says. “Now it’s out there and we need to get on with the reforms.” In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Outlining details to the UK’s parliament, Wallace described the military support as “the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Wallace, Rishi Sunak and the people of Britain for the “powerful contribution to our common victory over tyrany”, adding that tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”. The Kremlin said the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, Baerbock said at a joint news conference with Hoekstra, who said this “deliberate Russian policy” is “tearing families apart and traumatising children”. Russia carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Russia and Belarus began joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK’s ministry of defence’s latest intelligence update. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke by phone on Monday where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, as well as the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has announced her resignation following a series of blunders and a growing impression that she has struggled to deal with the challenges of overseeing the country’s military since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Britain and its prime minister and defence secretary after the announcement that UK will supply 14 Challenger 2 tanks as part of a new military support package for Kyiv. Tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”, Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. The UK will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace announced what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called for the establishment of a special international tribunal to prosecute Russian leaders over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Baerbock and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, also condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children, calling it a deliberate policy of cruel and inhumane abductions that is tearing families apart. A tribunal must be created to “investigate the Russian leadership and put them on trial”, the German minister said in a speech at the Academy of International Law in The Hague, where the international criminal court is based. It could be supplemented with international elements, “at a location outside Ukraine, with financial support from partners and with international prosecutors and judges, so that impartiality and legitimacy are guaranteed”, she continued. Ukraine and the EU have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes, including the deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. During a news conference later today, Baerbock addressed Ukrainian reports of children being deported to Russia and given up for adoption there. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, she said. Baerbock added: Their parents, families, caregivers must no longer be in uncertainty and fear. These children have their homes with their families in Ukraine. These children did not leave their homes voluntarily. These children have been abducted. At least 1,000 children were seized from schools and orphanages in the Kherson region during Russia’s eight-month occupation of the area, according to local authorities. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Her Dutch counterpart, also speaking at the press conference, said: This deliberate Russian policy is tearing families apart and traumatising children. It is cruel and it is inhumane. And let me be clear that children abducted by Russia must be returned to their own country as soon as possible. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Berlin is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv by allowing the export of German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. Germany has resisted the move so far, saying western tanks should only be supplied to Ukraine if there is agreement among Kyiv’s main allies, particularly the US. Speaking in parliament today, Wallace said: It has been reported that obviously Poland is very keen to donate some Leopards, as is Finland. All of this currently relies on the German government’s decisions - not only whether the Germans will supply their own Leopards, but whether or not they’ll give permissions to others. I would urge my German colleagues to do that. Finland’s defence minister, Mikko Savola, said today that Finland’s stance on giving Leopard tanks to Ukraine depends on Germany’s lead, after President Sauli Niinisto said Finland could donate a small number of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine if a wider group of European nations also decided to do so. Savola told Reuters: It depends very much on Germany’s lead how we act with these Leopard tanks. These require a German export permit and in addition to that, the German defence industry has a very strong role in this, in how substitutive equipment can be obtained. On Thursday, Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, said Berlin should not stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine. That would give the green light to countries such as Poland, which has said it wants to take such a step as part of a coalition. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Britain’s shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the government’s first package of UK military assistance for 2023 “has Labour’s fullest support”. Ukraine needs more combined military firepower “to break the battlefield deadlock”, Healey said, adding that 2023 would be a “decisive year” in the war in Ukraine. He added: That’s why this first package of UK military assistance for 2023 with tanks, artillery, infantry vehicles, ammunition and missiles has Labour’s fullest support. Challenger 2 is a world-class tank and it can help Ukraine retake lost ground and limit the cost in Ukrainian lives. The death of dozens of Russian soldiers in a new year missile strike on a building in occupied eastern Ukraine has not dented Moscow’s resolve almost a year after it first launched its invasion, according to a report. The strike in Makiivka killed 89 people, Russia’s defence ministry has so far conceded. It is the biggest loss of life from a single attack that Moscow has acknowledged since it began its invasion in February. Yet the strike provoked little more than murmurs of discontent in the region of Samara in southwestern Russia, where many of the dead were from, the Wall Street Journal reports. Few people in the region are openly resisting Russia’s war in Ukraine, which the paper writes “highlights an advantage for the Kremlin as it digs in for a long war”. It says: Mr Putin faces little domestic pressure over its costs, even as the body count rises. His decision to mobilise 300,000 men appears to have shored up Russian lines, which were wobbling late last year after a series of defeats, and allowed them to advance for the first time since July, claiming the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine. Russian state-run polling on the war suggests public support for what Moscow calls its special military operation dropped after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of troops to fight in Ukraine, before soaring again in November once the mobilisation was declared order. The polling suggests Russians will tolerate another round of mobilisation, according to a former Kremlin official. The UK’s defence ministry has confirmed the announcement by its minister, Ben Wallace, that Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. The Ministry of Defence shared a video of the battle tank “doing what it does best”. The UK’s decision to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine is a “calibrated response to Russia’s growing aggression and indiscriminate bombing”, Wallace continues. He says none of the international support for Ukraine is “an attack on Russia, or Nato-orchestrated aggression, let alone a proxy war”. From the outset, President Putin believed his forces would be welcomed with open arms, that Ukrainians wouldn’t fight and that western support would crumble. He has been proved wrong on all counts. Today’s package will help accelerate the conclusion of Putin’s occupation and all its brutality and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, if necessary, Ukraine retains its momentum supported by the international community that is determined more than ever, that Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion will fail. Wallace welcomed the decision by the French government to send AMX 10-RC light combat tanks to Ukraine as well as the US’s new weapons package that will include about 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. These contributions are “important in and of themselves” but they represent part of an international effort that “collectively conveys a force multiplier effect”, he said. Wallace says: In December, I told the house that I was developing options to respond to Russia’s continued aggression in a calibrated and determined manner. Today, I can announce the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success. This includes a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. We will donate AS-90 guns to Ukraine. This comprises a battery of eight guns of high readiness and two further batteries at varying stages of readiness. Today’s package is an “important increase to Ukrainian capabilities”, he continues. It means they can go from existing to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. President Putin cannot win, but he’s equally certain he can continue inflicting this wanton violence and human suffering until his forces are ejected from their defensive positions and expelled from the country. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, says it is “notable” that Russia is using forced labour of convicts to manufacture weaponry. Moscow’s appointment of Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, as its overall commander for the war in Ukraine, in the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscow’s military leadership is a “visible tip of an iceberg of factionalism within the Russian command”, Wallace tells MPs. He says there is no loss of momentum from the international community in its support of Ukraine in 2023, he said. Wallace adds: Quite the opposite. President Putin believed the west would get tired, bored and fragment. Ukraine is continuing to fight. Far from fragmenting, the west is accelerating its efforts. Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace said Russia had “singularly failed to break the will of the Ukrainian people” and had “managed to lose significant numbers of generals and commanding officers”. He said: We now would expect a trend back towards a Russian offensive, no matter how much loss of life accompanies it. Ukraine’s allies must “accelerate our collective efforts to dramatically, economically and militarily to keep the pressure” on Vladimir Putin, Wallace said. Announcing what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”, Wallace said the UK would send a squadron of Challenge 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. In a call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, confirmed for the first time that it was Britain’s intention to provide a small number of Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv. After the phone call, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the offer of Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems was a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. In response, the Kremlin said today that the Challenger 2s “will burn” on the battlefield, and claimed the supplies were an attempt to draw out the conflict. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia has carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address.

Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Tanks arguably decided the first world war, after four years of deadlock, and were indispensable throughout the second. Yet after the initial Russian invasion, one of the surprising features of the war in Ukraine is that it has not been a war of dramatic manoeuvre, but rather only modestly changing fronts. However, with the Russians trying to fortify their positions, ahead perhaps of a renewed attack, Kyiv is under pressure to find a breakthrough this spring. With Nato unwilling to help Ukraine with combat air power, the answer, for now, lies in the heavily armoured tank – which finally, the west is prepared to provide. Britain will send a squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks and Poland wants to send another 14 German-made Leopard 2s, if Berlin (as is increasingly looking likely) grants permission. It is a start, but well short of a pre-Christmas Ukrainian demand for 300 tanks and at least 600 fighting vehicles (of which about 90 have been pledged). Only tanks have the “protection, mobility and firepower to maintain momentum even once they make contact with enemy forces in strength”, said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Rusi thinktank. The question, however, is what number will give Kyiv chance to mount its own offensive. Read the full analysis by Dan Sabbagh here: President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone today where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to both readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, after talks between Moscow and Kyiv’s human rights commissioners in Turkey last week. Putin “drew attention to the destructive line of the Kyiv regime, which relies on the intensification of hostilities with the support of western sponsors, increasing the volume of transferred weapons and military equipment”, the Kremlin’s readout of the call continued. It said the two leaders also discussed the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. They also discussed the creation of a gas hub in Turkey, as well as the normalisation of Turkish-Syrian relations, it said. Erdoğan’s office said the Turkish president renewed his offer to help mediate an end to the conflict in Ukraine during the call. A statement read: During the call, President Erdoğan reiterated that Turkey is ready to undertake the task of facilitating and mediating for the establishment of a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian-imposed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, has posted to Telegram to say that in total the air defences of the Crimean city repulsed 10 drones from Ukraine this morning. He told residents: The air defence and the Black Sea Fleet shot down ten out of ten [Ukrainian drones] over the sea. No objects either in the city or in the water area were damaged. Everything is calm in the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia claimed to annex Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has posted to its Telegram news channel to report that its correspondents say explosions have been heard in Kherson. More details soon … A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Police in Arctic Norway said last week that a person had illegally entered from Russia by crossing the border. The man, identified only as a foreigner, was detained by border guards after he reportedly visited a private house in the border area and asked for help. The case was handed to Norwegian immigration police and the man was transferred to Oslo, where he was placed in a centre for violators of migration laws. Police in Norway have declined to comment on the case. The independent Russian news website Meduza writes that Medvedev reportedly served as the commander of the unit that included Yevgeny Nuzhin, a Wagner mercenary who was apparently executed by the group with a sledgehammer in a video that surfaced online in November. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, writes that he has been hit with sanctions by the Russian government. Cleverly writes on Twitter: I’ve been sanctioned by the Russian government. Good. If this is the price for supporting Ukrainian freedom, then I’m happy to be sanctioned #SlavaUkraini The Shakhtar Donetsk president, Rinat Akhmetov, has donated £20.5m of Mykhaylo Mudryk’s Chelsea transfer fee to the Ukrainian war effort. Chelsea beat Arsenal to the signing of Mudryk on Sunday and paraded him at Stamford Bridge, where they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 in the Premier League. Mudryk, who has agreed an eight-and-a-half-year contract, had a Ukraine flag draped over his shoulders. Chelsea have paid an initial €70m (£62m) for the winger with €30m (£26.5m) to follow in add-ons. The money is a boost to Shakhtar, who have been displaced from their home in Donetsk, but Akhmetov – Ukraine’s richest businessman, according to Forbes – has made clear that without his country’s soldiers there would be no football. As such, he has made the financial gesture, launching the Heart of Azovstal project. Azovstal is Akhmetov’s steel plant in Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters defied weeks of Russian bombardment before the city fell. Azovstal has become a symbol of bravery, endurance and the indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people. “I want to thank the entire civilised world for helping Ukraine,” Akhmetov said. We can only talk about Ukrainian football because of the Ukrainian army, the Ukrainian people and the tremendous support we have had during this incredibly difficult time. And the only way we can defeat the evil that has come to our homes is by working together. Read the full story here: The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. He is expected to travel to south Ukraine and Rivne nuclear power plants (NPPs) as well as to the Chornobyl site to launch the missions consisting of two IAEA experts at each of the facilities. The IAEA already has a permanent presence of up to four experts at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and a two-member team will also be stationed at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant in the coming days. In a statement, Grossi said: Soon the IAEA will be permanently present at all of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, including Chornobyl. This is an important step in our work to help Ukraine during these immensely difficult and challenging times. Our nuclear safety and security experts will monitor the situation at the plants, assess their equipment and other needs, provide technical support and advice, and report their findings to IAEA headquarters. The Kremlin has denied that Russian missile strikes hit residential buildings in Ukraine, after local officials in Dnipro said at least 40 people were killed in Saturday’s attack on a residential block in the Ukrainian south-central city. During a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The Russian armed forces do not strike residential buildings or social infrastructure facilities. Attacks are made on military targets, either obvious or disguised. Ukraine’s air force has said the residential block was struck by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which is known to be inaccurate and that Kyiv says it has no way of shooting down. Here are some of the latest images we have received showing the aftermath of Russia’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. He said: I call for decisive actions by the German government. For all sorts of weapons to be delivered. The battle for freedom and our future is raging as we speak ... Tanks must not be left in storehouses, but placed in their hands. A Swedish prosecutor has said there will be no formal investigation into a demonstration last week in Stockholm in which a puppet of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was hung from its feet, according to a report. Images of the hanged effigy near the Swedish capital’s city hall were published by a pro-Kurdish group, the Rojava Committee of Sweden, who compared the Turkish leader to Italy’s fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, who was hung upside down after his execution in the final days of the second world war. Sweden’s prime minister condemned the demonstration and said it was a sabotage of Sweden’s bid to join Nato. Turkey summoned Sweden’s ambassador, Staffan Herrstrom, on Thursday and demanded that those responsible for the demonstration be prosecuted. But a Swedish prosecutor, Lucas Eriksson, told the Aftonbladet newspaper: I received the case as defamation, but did not think it could amount to defamation. Therefore, I decided not to initiate a preliminary investigation. In a historic decision in May, Sweden and Finland announced they wished to join the Nato military alliance, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While 28 out of 30 Nato members have ratified their bids, Hungary and Turkey have not, with the latter likely to prove the biggest hurdle. Ankara has so far refused to ratify the applications unless the two countries do more to clamp down on Kurdish groups it regards as terrorists. The number of people killed in Saturday’s Russian missile attack on a residential block in Ukraine’s south-central city of Dnipro has risen to 40, according to a local official. Dozens are still missing, Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Rescue efforts are still under way. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the exercises. Belarus has described the drills as purely defensive. The country was used as a base for Russian troops to launch their failed assault on Kyiv in February 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Air defences in Sevastopol in Crimea have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor in the area which Russia annexed in 2014. As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 37, the state broadcaster Suspilne reported Ukrainian officials had confirmed to it. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday latest address that the victims included a 15-year-old girl. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. President Vladimir Putin has told Russian state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum. “The dynamic is positive,” he told Rossiya 1 state television. “Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” German defence minister Christine Lambrecht on Monday announced ger resignation. Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours to continue our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Monday that the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. “They are using [Ukraine] as a tool to achieve their anti-Russian goals,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the British tanks, Reuters reports. “These tanks are burning and will burn just like the rest,” Peskov said. Britain said on Saturday it would send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks as well as other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Peskov said the new supplies from countries like Britain and Poland would not change the situation on the ground. The Kremlin spokesperson also, according to Russian-owned news agency RIA, denied that there was any conflict between Russia’s ministry of defence and the Wagner mercenary group. RIA posted to Telegram a report which said: The “conflict” between the ministry of defence and Wagner exists only in the information space, Peskov said. He noted that everyone is doing a common thing – fighting for the motherland. Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on Telegram that the death toll from the weekend’s Dnipro missile attack has risen to 37. It reports that local authorities have confirmed the higher number to it. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has today resigned, she said in a statement on Monday, the culmination of growing scepticism about her ability to bring the German army into shape against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. Reuters reports Lambrecht, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD), said in the statement: “Today I asked the chancellor to dismiss me from the office of federal minister of defence.” Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the joint air exercises being carried out by Russia and Belarus. In a message posted to Telegram, Chaus said: 125 explosions on the outskirts of six border settlements of Chernihiv region over the past week. The enemy uses mortars, grenade launchers, BM-21 Grad rocket artillery. Important! From 16 January to 1 February, a joint flight and tactical exercise will be held with the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation. The number of air alarms on the territory of Chernihiv oblast and the country in general may increase significantly. Don’t ignore any threat message. Chernihiv has borders with both Belarus to Russia to the north. Russian news agency Interfax is reporting that air defences in Sevastopol have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor. Interfax reports. “An attack by drones again. Air defence systems shot down a UAV over the sea in the direction of Belbek ,” [Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev] wrote in his telegram channel. Interfax adds the governor also reported one downed drone over the bay. Sevastopol is the largest city in the Crimean peninsula, an area of Ukraine which Russia claimed to annex in 2014. Belbek is an airfield north-west of the city which has previously been a target for Ukraine. In Germany, Die Welt reports that at a demonstration in Berlin on Sunday, the flag of the chiefly unrecognised self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic was seen, a report which is being picked up by Russian state media Tass. Martin Heller writes for Die Welt: The content of a video of the demonstration march in Berlin on Sunday, with which thousands commemorated Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, is now causing a stir. In the video of the demonstration, left-wing demonstrators - white skin, accent-free German and mostly male - chant anti-Western slogans: “Mali, Donbass, Gaza City: finally flatten the West!”. A banner from a “communist organization” carried in front of the group reads: “The main enemy is at home”. At the same event, international observers noticed a flag from the “Donetsk People’s Republic” illegally proclaimed by Russia. This also causes discussions on the internet. Suspilne, the Ukrainian state broadcaster, is reporting that three people were killed in the Kherson region yesterday. In a message posted to Telegram, it stated: On 15 January, the Russian army shelled the territory of the Kherson region 90 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars and tanks. Three people died, 14 were injured, said the head of the region Yaroslav Yanushevych. The claims have not been independently verified. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, has given more details of an attack of Zaporizhzhia in a Telegram post. He writes: The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including 2 children aged 9 and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised. In the building itself, the windows were broken, the supporting structures were not damaged. He added that in a separate attack: The rocket hit the territory of a business. A fire broke out on the spot. There is no information about the victims. Rescuers are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian state-owned news agency is reporting claims from the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) that in the last week two people died and four were injured by Ukrainian fire into the territory which the LPR occupies and which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Tass also reported the claim that 52 houses and three civil infrastructure facilities were destroyed and damaged, including one educational institution, in the attacks. Tass said that the claims, which have not been independently verified, were reported by a representative of the so-called “Joint centre for control and coordination of issues related to war crimes of Ukraine”. Prior to Russia’s claim to have annexed the Luhansk region, the LPR, which was formed in 2014, was recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Reuters reports that a Ukrainian vessel carrying peas was grounded in Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on Monday, and traffic in the strait was suspended. No damage was reported. The joint coordination centre in Istanbul, which runs the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal operations, said at the weekend the ship was travelling from Pivdennyi – a commercial seaport in the Ukrainian city of Yuzhne, near Odesa – to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Mersin. Several tugs were among vessels sent to provide assistance to the ship, the coastguard authority said. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional state administration head, said Russia launched a rocket attack on the regional centre in a Telegram post at about 1am local time. The enemy launched a rocket attack on the regional centre and suburbs. There is destruction of civil, residential and industrial infrastructure. Information was received about several lightly wounded. All relevant services are on site.” The secretary of the Zaporizhzhia city council, Anatoly Kurtev, confirmed three people were taken to hospital. Russians fired at our city again. As a result of the night attack, people were injured. There are damaged houses. Three people were transported to hospitals. Among them are two children aged nine and 15.” As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. “Overall, the UAF continue to gradually advance their front line east on the edge of Kremina town,” the report read. “Over the last six weeks, both Russia and Ukraine have achieved hard-fought but limited gains in different sectors. “In these circumstances, a key operational challenge for both sides is to generate formations of uncommitted, capable troops which can exploit the tactical successes to create operational breakthroughs.” The US military has launched an expanded, more sophisticated training programme of Ukrainian forces that is focused on large-scale combat and designed to bolster Ukraine’s ability to take back territory from Russian forces, the Pentagon’s top general said on Sunday. Gen Mark A. Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the training had begun on Sunday at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany and will continue for five or six weeks, according to a Washington Post report. About 500 soldiers will reportedly go through the initial version of training, focused on what the military calls combined-arms warfare, in which tanks, artillery, combat vehicles and other weapons are “layered to maximise the violence they inflict”, according to the Post. We want the Ukrainians to have a capability to successfully defend their country,” Milley said. “Ukraine is doing nothing more than defending itself, and they are trying to liberate Russian-occupied Ukraine.” “It’ll take a bit of time,” Milley added. “Five, six, seven, eight weeks, who knows. We’ll see what happens here. But in terms of the criticality of it, the need is now.” Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Zelenskiy has pleaded for more western weaponry, saying that Russian “terror” could be stopped only on the battlefield. Earlier this month, France, Germany and the US respectively promised French AMX-10 RC light tanks, 40 German Marder infantry vehicles, and 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. However, pressure is growing on the allies to go further and agree to delivery of battle tanks. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged on Saturday to provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, making it the first western country to supply the heavy tanks Kyiv has been calling for. Russia’s embassy in Britain warned that “bringing tanks to the conflict zone … will only serve to intensify combat operations, generating more casualties, including among the civilian population”. As Russian and Belarusian forces conduct joint air force drills today in a show of cooperation, it appears to be business as usual for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader earlier told Rossiya 1 state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum and is going according to plan. The dynamic is positive. Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” Putin said he hoped soldiers would deliver more wins after Russia claimed control of the eastern Ukrainian saltmining town of Soledar – a claim disputed by Kyiv. Belarus’s ministry of defence has just issued this statement regarding its joint air force drills with Russia this morning. Today, a joint tactical flight exercise of the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, which are part of the aviation component of the regional grouping of troops (forces), has started.” The ministry added that the main goal of the exercise is “to increase operational compatibility in the joint performance of combat training tasks”. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. A subdivision of the 120th Separate Guards Mechanised Brigade, as part of the coordination of the Belarusian and Russian parts of the regional grouping of forces, began to carry out a number of combat training tasks. After the march to the 227th combined-arms training ground, the military personnel will begin to conduct control classes in combat training subjects.” Minsk earlier said the drills are defensive. However, the ongoing buildup of Russian troops in Belarus, combined with a flurry of military activity in the country, is an echo to what was happening there just before Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow used the country as a springboard to launch the attack. Together with Moscow, Minsk has also been bolstering the drills with weaponry and military equipment. Unofficial Telegram military monitoring channels have been reporting a series of fighters, helicopters and military transport planes coming to Belarus since the start of the year – eight fighters and four cargo planes on Sunday alone. The Belarusian defence ministry said only that “units” of Russia’s air forces have been arriving in Belarus. During the tactical flight exercise, all airfields and training grounds of the Air Force and Air Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Belarus will be involved,” the ministry said in a statement as cited by Reuters. The situation on Belarus’s southern border – the border with Ukraine – was “not very calm”, and Ukraine has been “provoking” Belarus, said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. We’re maintaining restraint and patience, keeping our gunpowder dry,” Muraveyko said. “We have the necessary set of forces and means that will respond to any manifestations of aggression or a terrorist threat on our territory.” Ukraine has continuously warned of possible attacks from Belarus and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that the country must be ready at its border with Belarus. The Kremlin has denied that it has been pressuring the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, to take a more active role in the conflict in Ukraine. Minsk has said it will not enter the war. A series of haunting images show the aftermath of Sunday’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. Dnipro’s regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, confirmed 35 people were killed in the attack in an update shared to Telegram about 8.30am on Monday. The search and rescue operation in Dnipro has been going on for almost 40 hours. At night, rescuers pulled out several more dead from under the rubble of a high-rise building destroyed by a Russian missile. At that time, the enemy attack claimed the lives of 35 residents of the building. Among them are two children. 39 people were saved, 75 were injured. Among the injured are 14 children. The fate of another 35 residents of the building is unknown. The search for people under the rubble continues. Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters: The chances of saving people now are minimal. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the Russian people’s “cowardly silence” over the attack, noting that Ukraine had received messages of sympathy from around the world over “this terror.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Rescuers continue to comb the rubble of a nine-story apartment building that was destroyed by a Russian strike in Dnipro on Sunday, as the death toll from the attack climbs to 35. Russia and Belarus will begin joint air force drills on Monday, which have triggered fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. Minsk says the drills are “purely defensive in nature” though Ukraine has warned of possible attacks from its neighbour to the north. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address that “the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child – a girl, she was 15 years old”. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal.

Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024. The warning from arms manufacturer Rheinmetall will dampen Kyiv’s hopes that the UK’s promise to deliver Challenger 2 tanks would encourage other European nations to swiftly follow suit. “Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The UK prime minister has confirmed the country will provide 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks and other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict. The UK foreign secretary has said “now is the time to accelerate and go further and faster” in giving Ukraine the support it needs. In a column for British tabloid the Sun on Sunday, James Cleverly writes that the Russian army is on the defensive and morale among its troops is pitiful, blaming the “shambolic state of Russian military logistics”. Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. “The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany next Friday where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Belarus’s security council said on Sunday that joint air force drills with Russia, due to start on Monday, were purely defensive in nature and would focus on reconnaissance missions and how to thwart a potential attack. “The exercise is purely defensive in nature,” said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. “It will be a set of measures to prepare our and Russian aviation to carry out the relevant combat missions.” For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter.",

                    "bodyText": "Craggy, grey-haired and 80 years old, Harrison Ford might seem a bit old to don his brown Fedora-style hat or crack his whip as Indiana Jones. But a trailer for his upcoming film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny offers a flashback to Indy in his swashbuckling glory days. “That is my actual face at that age,” the actor explained on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “They have this artificial intelligence (AI) programme. It can go through every foot of film that Lucasfilm owns because I did a bunch of movies for them and they have all this footage including film that wasn’t printed: stock. They could mine it from where the light is coming from, the expression. But that’s my actual face. Then I put little dots on my face and I say the words and they make it. It’s fantastic.” Having discovered the secret of eternal youth, Ford joked: “That’s what I see when I look in the mirror now.” He is not the only actor to get a digital facelift with an assist from AI. Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and other cast members will play younger versions of themselves in Here, directed by Robert Zemeckis, thanks to a tool that the AI company Metaphysic says can create “high-resolution photorealistic faceswaps and de-ageing effects on top of actors’ performances live and in real time without the need for further compositing or VFX work”. Metaphysic’s website proclaims: “We are world leaders in creating AI generated content that looks real” and suggests: “Use AI to create your own hyperreal avatar”. The company has just struck a deal with the Creative Artists Agency “to develop generative AI tools and services for talent”, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Just as the buzzy AI chatbot ChatGPT threatens to upend journalism, speechwriting and school essays, so AI could turn digital de-ageing from something that requires many months of highly skilled artists to something that many people can do in their bedrooms. And as the technology becomes ever more sophisticated, there are fears that deepfake technology could fall into the wrong hands and be weaponised. Olcun Tan, a German-born visual effects supervisor based in Los Angeles, reflects: “We’re going through a big revolution. This is like the invention of nuclear power. This is a big deal. It’s underestimated and overlooked. Currently, it feels like, ‘Oh, it’s a toy, it’s awesome, look what it can do,’ but this is just the start of a big change in our economic structure because it will do a lot more than normal humans can do.” De-ageing has met mixed results so far. Examples include Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy, Robert Downey Jr in Captain America: Civil War, Michael Douglas in Ant Man, Kurt Russell in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, Will Smith in Gemini Man and Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in various instalments of Star Wars. One of the more impressive was Samuel L Jackson who, in 2019’s Captain Marvel, shed about 25 years and featured in the entire story rather than just a cameo. “The artists meticulously compared Jackson to how he looked in his mid-90s-era movies to see precisely how skin would hang off his face or how light would hit his cheeks,” according to the Wrap website. Why bother? Better to have a de-aged Harrison Ford, some argue, than to have a different actor playing one of his indelible roles, as happened when he took on the young Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Many fans found it a jarring experience. Drexel Heard, a political activist who has worked in Hollywood, says: “We’re getting to the point where viewers want to see that same person where it’s not going to take them out of the moment. Because our brains automatically go, ‘Well, that’s not the same person. Who’s that actor? Will that actor be better than the actor that we are watching right now?’ Nobody wants to have to go through that as an audience member.” Not everyone sees it that way, however. Tan, who uses an AI-assisted tool called Shapeshifter, says: “It’s time for the old farts to make space. It’s annoying. There’s no reason for somebody to be in his 80s and still look like in his 30s. There’s no point. What it does is create a culture of recycling. “It’s like Mickey Mouse going on forever. You have a Mickey Mouse and it doesn’t need any water, it doesn’t need any food, it doesn’t need a contract. They can monetise it any way they want. It doesn’t need to sleep. It works 24 hours if they want in 10 copies or 30 copies simultaneously. What’s happening right now is these actors are becoming more that. They become like a brand.” Tan adds: “In Harrison Ford’s case, the guy did of course Indiana Jones but there could be easily a new Indiana Jones introduced, a next generation. Why even recycle all that stuff constantly? Because it’s a sure thing for money making, obviously, but the question arises, what does it do to our society if you have always the same idols being recreated on the screen? It’s like we got stuck somehow in the past and we don’t want to look into the future.” Martin Scorsese’s 2019 movie The Irishman knocked four decades off Al Pacino, then 79, and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, both 76, but fell into the “uncanny valley” trap of being distracting, eerie and not quite lifelike enough.

He said the bill now ensured the 43% emissions reduction target was a floor and not a ceiling, and ambition could be ratcheted up over time.</p> \n<p>He said Labor had bolstered its initial proposal by ensuring government agencies would have to consider climate targets before funding new projects, and had clarified the role the Climate Change Authority would play in providing expert advice.</p> \n<p>But while supporting the legislation, he foreshadowed further discussions with Labor about the safeguards mechanism, and about inserting a climate trigger in environmental regulations, which would make it hard for new fossil fuel developments to secure approval.</p> \n<p>“The fight begins now to get Labor to stop opening coal and gas mines,” the Greens leader said.</p> \n<p>Bandt vowed to “comb the entire budget for any public money … going to coal and gas corporations and amend the budget to remove them”.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

Liberals to change position on climate legislation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said it was “a good day for Australia”<em>.</em></p> \n<p>“A good day therefore [for] the economy, a good day for the future,” he said. “The climate wars may not be over, but they are suddenly in retreat, under this government.”</p> \n<p>In question time, Albanese said Labor was “another step closer to delivering our mandate”, deflecting Coalition attacks about power prices by accusing them of “opposition to the cheapest form of energy, renewables” and support for “the most expensive solutions – nuclear power”.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Bandt claimed that Labor’s position on new coal and gas projects was “untenable ultimately”, citing ambition for greater action from Australia’s “closest security allies” including the US and Pacific nations.</p> \n<p>“This is round one,” he said. “There is three years of this parliament and there are a number of points coming up where we will push to stop opening coal and gas.”</p> \n<p>Bandt cited the review of the EPBC Act, which he said “needs a climate trigger”. “An environment law that allows projects to go ahead, even if it makes climate change worse and destroys the environment is an environment law with a massive hole in the middle of it.”</p> \n<p>The crossbench believed it has secured government agreement for a range of other amendments including: an objects clause in the legislation, a statutory review in five years of the act’s effectiveness, and clearer reporting obligations for the minister and Climate Change Authority.</p> \n<p>Bowen said the government had “good conversations across the parliament with people of goodwill” and accepted changes that “improve the bill” and implement Labor’s mandate.</p> \n<p>Others had “completely ruled themselves out of any discussions with the government”, he said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday the Coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/peter-dutton-rejects-push-by-moderate-liberals-to-change-position-on-climate-legislation\">resolved to oppose the bill</a>, reasoning that

                    "bodyText": "The House of Representatives is moving towards passage of Labor’s bill enshrining emissions reductions targets for 2030 and 2050 after the Greens signalled they would support the legislation and Liberal MP Bridget Archer confirmed she would cross the floor. After weeks of negotiations, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, confirmed on Wednesday his party would back the Albanese government’s legislation in both chambers, and king-making Senate independent, David Pocock, confirmed his priority was “getting a target locked in and legislated”. The legislation will pass the lower house on Thursday morning before moving to the Senate during the next parliamentary sitting fortnight in September. Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday the measure – an opening salvo in ending Australia’s decade long climate wars – was “as important a piece of legislation as will come before this parliament”. Despite losing a swathe of heartland metropolitan seats to climate-focussed independents at the election on 21 May, the Coalition has resolved to oppose the bill. But Archer confirmed on Wednesday night she would support Labor’s primary legislation, but not the consequential amendments bill. Archer told the chamber climate change was an issue that “transcends age, gender, political beliefs and socioeconomic circumstances” and she had been approached from all types of constituents – including a Baptist minister, business leaders and pensioners of the left and right – “all of who believe this is not an issue of left or right”. At the National Press Club on Wednesday Bandt said the Greens would support Labor’s legislation. He said the bill now ensured the 43% emissions reduction target was a floor and not a ceiling, and ambition could be ratcheted up over time. He said Labor had bolstered its initial proposal by ensuring government agencies would have to consider climate targets before funding new projects, and had clarified the role the Climate Change Authority would play in providing expert advice. But while supporting the legislation, he foreshadowed further discussions with Labor about the safeguards mechanism, and about inserting a climate trigger in environmental regulations, which would make it hard for new fossil fuel developments to secure approval. “The fight begins now to get Labor to stop opening coal and gas mines,” the Greens leader said. Bandt vowed to “comb the entire budget for any public money … going to coal and gas corporations and amend the budget to remove them”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese told reporters in Canberra that Labor had agreed to amendments that were “consistent with the policy we took to the election”, but had not committed to the Greens to consider a climate trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. He ruled out using the safeguards mechanism to block new fossil fuel projects. Albanese welcomed the Greens’ decision that “they are prepared to vote for the legislation” even though some of their amendments were not accepted. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said it was “a good day for Australia”. “A good day therefore [for] the economy, a good day for the future,” he said. “The climate wars may not be over, but they are suddenly in retreat, under this government.” In question time, Albanese said Labor was “another step closer to delivering our mandate”, deflecting Coalition attacks about power prices by accusing them of “opposition to the cheapest form of energy, renewables” and support for “the most expensive solutions – nuclear power”. Earlier, Bandt claimed that Labor’s position on new coal and gas projects was “untenable ultimately”, citing ambition for greater action from Australia’s “closest security allies” including the US and Pacific nations. “This is round one,” he said. “There is three years of this parliament and there are a number of points coming up where we will push to stop opening coal and gas.” Bandt cited the review of the EPBC Act, which he said “needs a climate trigger”. “An environment law that allows projects to go ahead, even if it makes climate change worse and destroys the environment is an environment law with a massive hole in the middle of it.” The crossbench believed it has secured government agreement for a range of other amendments including: an objects clause in the legislation, a statutory review in five years of the act’s effectiveness, and clearer reporting obligations for the minister and Climate Change Authority. Bowen said the government had “good conversations across the parliament with people of goodwill” and accepted changes that “improve the bill” and implement Labor’s mandate. Others had “completely ruled themselves out of any discussions with the government”, he said. On Tuesday the Coalition resolved to oppose the bill, reasoning that Labor had already increased Australia’s emission reduction obligations under the Paris agreement, and the opposition parties could determine a new target closer to the next election. Independent MPs including Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Allegra Spender have voiced support for the bill – but it will be the Jacqui Lambie Network and David Pocock’s votes in the Senate which Labor will need to pass it. The independent MP for Fowler, Dai Le, has indicated she would abstain in the climate bill vote.",

                    "bodyText": "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Putin’s comments comes amid increasingly gloomy commentary from Russian war correspondents and military bloggers over the severity of the situation that has seen a large-scale withdrawal from the Kharkiv region, the loss of the strategic town of Lyman on Friday and Ukrainian advances in the Kherson region. The scale of the recent defeats was underlined by a report by the BBC’s Russian service that said an elite Russian military intelligence unit may have lost up to three-quarters of its reconnaissance manpower in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s southern command said it had extended its area of control by six to 12 miles in the Kherson region and the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed the recapture of a series of villages. The territory recaptured is to the south of the city of Kryvyi Rih in the direction of Nova Kakhovka as well as west along the north bank of the Dnipro river towards Kherson. “The Ukrainian army is making quite fast and powerful progress in the south of our country,” said Zelenskiy in his nightly address on Tuesday. “Dozens of settlements have already been exempted from the Russian pseudo-referendum this week alone … and this is far from a complete list.” He named eight villages in the Kherson region. Some Russian propagandists and officials blamed the losses on Nato. “We are regrouping [our forces] along the front, which means that we can gather strength and strike back,” Kirill Stremousov, the Moscow-appointed deputy head of Kherson region, told the RIA Novosti news agency. Stremousov said it was “impossible” for them to enter Kherson city. A Russian war reporter for state TV, Roman Saponkov, wrote to his Telegram followers that Russia was losing in Kherson. “Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat from the north on the right bank is a disaster.” The losses came as Putin ordered on Wednesday his government to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, but was met with the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company saying he was taking charge and urging workers not to sign any documents with Russia. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. About 15,000 of Russia’s best-trained troops are struggling to fight off Ukrainians on the western bank of occupied Kherson, despite movements of Russian troops from the eastern front to the south, which has thinned Russian forces elsewhere. According to Jack Watling, a senior analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, Russian troops around Kherson have retreated to their second line of defence to shorten their frontline. “There’s no evidence of surrender or collapse [of Russian forces] … like we saw in Kharkiv region,” said Watling, noting the political importance for Russia of holding on to Kherson city, the only regional centre it has managed to acquire since February. But if Ukraine’s forces manage to break through Russia’s second line of defence, they will be able to cut the Russian supply lines with a wider range of cheaper artillery and trap them on the western bank of Kherson, he added. “At the moment, the bridges are being hit by Himars [rockets], which are scarce and very expensive … [if they advance further] they can afford to open up against more incidental targets,” said Watling of the bridges supplying Russian forces on Kherson’s west bank. Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, added that Ukraine’s recent progress had been a product of a process, not a turning point. “For months now, Russia has been getting weaker, it has been bleeding its army on the field, it’s been losing a huge amount of equipment. On the other hand, the Ukrainians have been getting stronger; they have better-trained forces and better military equipment.” He added: “This hasn’t happened overnight, this has been the way the war has been trending but now we can say it reached the tipping point in September.” In the short term there is nothing Russia can do because they waited too long to mobilise, O’Brien said. Russia, meanwhile, has continued to attack behind Ukraine’s frontlines, a mixture of military and civilian targets. On Wednesday morning, it launched a significant drone attack on Bila Tserkva in Kyiv region and fired rockets into Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro region. But O’Brien doubted Russia had enough quality missiles to alter the situation behind the frontlines to affect the battlefield. “It’s more of a question of, can they just hold on and hope that they can get a trained and re-equipped force back in the spring, but even then there’s a question about whether they can do that,” said O’Brien. He said Russia would need to produce more equipment and properly train troops but its system of mobilisation appeared “chaotic”. Konrad Muzyka, an independent military analyst, said he had initially thought the war may last for years, but after the Kharkiv region, it could be much less. “It does not look good for [Russia] … They are not able to defend properly, let alone conduct any offensives,” said Muzyka. “This Russian leadership thinks with [new] reservists they will be able to stop Ukrainian advances, but I’m not sure.

The update said Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> annexed in 2014.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages.</strong> Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said.</strong> Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odesa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of Lviv, </strong><strong>Andriy Sadovyi</strong><strong>, has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter.</strong> In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical – there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities had worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>There could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy\">more attacks in the “next two or three months”</a> similar to the strikes in Crimea</strong>, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has hinted it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea\">behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes</a> in occupied Crimea</strong> that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. <strong>Russia blamed saboteurs</strong> for orchestrating the series of explosions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal</strong> in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyber</strong><strong>-attack on its website</strong>, but said its operations had not been disrupted. “On 16 August 2022, the most powerful cyber-attack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>North Korea and the </strong><strong> self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”</strong>, Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist administration, said in a letter to Kim Jong-un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria </strong>on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/russia-warns-britain-against-planned-spy-plane-overflight\">warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight</a> over Russian territory</strong>, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Estonian authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/estonia-removes-soviet-era-tank-monument-amid-russia-tensions-narva\">removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal</a></strong> in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday.

                    "bodyText": "Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions, a British intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odesa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical – there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities had worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack”. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyber-attack on its website, but said its operations had not been disrupted. “On 16 August 2022, the most powerful cyber-attack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist administration, said in a letter to Kim Jong-un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland says it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists began using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, the foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said.",

The comparison to the former Iraqi minister who gained cult status for his outrageous lies came during a fractious prime minister’s questions, with Starmer saying Johnson was complacent about people’s “blindingly obvious” economic problems. The Labour leader said a mooted plan to let motorists get MOTs lasting two years instead of one made the ill-fated 1990s “cones hotline” look “visionary and inspirational”. He said Johnson was “only just waking up to the cost of living crisis” and had acted like an ostrich. Johnson accused Starmer of “droning on” and dismissed his call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down people’s energy bills, saying: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” In their final public pitches before next week’s local elections, the two leaders traded blows during a session that was focused mainly on the economy. Johnson was tackled over an anonymous Tory MP’s briefing to the Mail on Sunday accusing Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, of crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons chamber to distract the prime minister. Starmer said the UK was on course to have the slowest growth and highest inflation in the G7, and he said Johnson was failing to properly manage the economy. In a series of targeted questions designed to pin responsibility for the cost of living crisis on the government, Starmer said ministers were making life worse for working people with last month’s “tax-hiking budget” and by failing to help those whose fuel bills have spiralled. “They’re the party of excess profits, we’re the party of working people,” Starmer said. He accused ministers of letting prices “get out of control”, denying it was happening and failing to do anything about it. “A vote for Labour next week is a vote for a very different set of choices,” Starmer said. He said his party would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fare share, insulate homes to get bills down and close tax avoidance schemes by scrapping non-dom status. But Johnson repeatedly branded Starmer “Captain Hindsight”, saying the cost of living crisis was affecting people around the world and insisting: “This government is tackling it.” He said the recently published energy security strategy would “undo the mistakes of the previous Labour government” by pushing for a new nuclear power station to be built every year instead of every decade. Johnson dismissed the windfall tax on offshore energy companies, saying it would “clobber the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” The prime minister said a record number of jobs were being created and the Conservatives’ plans were better than Labour’s “by a mile”. He added: “Never forget, Labour-run Britain in 2010 – bankrupt because of what the Labour government did. They said they had no money left.”",

Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat.

There were two documented cases of Ukrainian servicemen having been tortured to death, he said. About 2,000 videos, photographs and audio files of alleged war crimes have been submitted to the UN mandated international commission of inquiry (UN COI) on Ukraine. The footage was captured through an app designed to create verifiable evidence. Two women in Russia-annexed Crimea, including Miss Crimea, have been found guilty of discrediting the Russian army by singing a patriotic Ukrainian song. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.”",

Migratory birds use the lagoon as a stopover during their long journey between Africa and central and northern Europe. They are key Mediterranean wetlands, the type of habitat that covered much of the whole Albanian coast until Enver Hoxha’s dictatorial regime <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Albania%20NC3_13%20October%202016_0.pdf\">drained large swaths of it in the 1950s and 60s</a>, in an attempt to eradicate malaria and develop the lowlands for agriculture.</p> <p>The Dalmatian pelican’s range spans much of Eurasia – from the Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east – but it has experienced a decline in the 20th century.

                    "bodyText": "The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, reacted strongly to the results of the nuclear inspection, saying Russia had confirmed its status as “the world’s top liar”. He said “The IAEA has checked three Ukrainian facilities in focus of Russian disinfo and found no evidence of any ‘dirty bombs’. I thank Rafael Mariano Grossi for IAEA’s excellent and prompt cooperation which helped counter Russian falsehoods. Russia has confirmed its status of the world’s top liar.” The Russian delegation resumed work at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) that runs the Black Sea grain deal operations in Istanbul and joined vessel inspections on Thursday, the UN secretariat at the centre said. It said the queue for inspections has been significantly reduced, with currently over 120 ships waiting to move, mainly those planning an inbound voyage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had said Wednesday that Moscow would rejoin the grain export deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Ukraine, but that it reserved the right to withdraw if necessary. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Putin said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. Russia on Thursday urged the United Nations, which sponsored the deal, to help fulfil the parts of the deal intended to ease Russia’s food and fertiliser exports. “We still do not see any results regarding a second aspect: the removal of obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. Russian agricultural exports do not fall explicitly under sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February, but Moscow says they are badly hindered by the restrictions imposed on its financial, logistics and insurance sectors. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has made no new commitments that go beyond the terms originally signed in July. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Moscow’s humiliating U-turn and hailed “a significant diplomatic result for our country and the whole world”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative continues,” he said in his Wednesday evening address. “The Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. This shows both the failure of the Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united”. The Russian flag has been removed from the Kherson regional administration, a building located on the west bank of the city where Ukrainian forces made significant advances a few weeks ago. Russian forces moved their regional headquarters across the Dnipro river to the left bank of Kherson city, according to Ukraine’s Centre of National Resistance. One of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupying authorities in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, posted to Telegram encouraging further civilian “evacuations” from the city – a move that has been described by Kyiv as forced deportations. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Command, is urging caution, saying that Russia’s unusual manoeuvres in Kherson might be a trap to lure in Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s grid operator Ukrenergo has confirmed that Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of the energy system. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region described “a tense night of massive attacks” but said on Thursday morning there were no known casualties. Russian attacks in the Donetsk oblast and Kharkiv oblast have killed at least five civilians in the past day, officials said. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 730 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone, bringing the total to 68,900 personnel lost so far in the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, according to the Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she hoped that Elon Musk’s tweet about a peace deal to end the war with Russia was a “chance mistake”. “He supported Ukraine from the very first day and that’s why Ukrainians really admired him,” Zelenska told the Guardian in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon. “So it was extremely sensitive for us to read the tweet.

The Russian foreign ministry objected to British agreements to train Ukrainian naval personnel, and accuse Britain of being involved in assisting an attack on the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol last weekend. Hungary’s parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join Nato, its foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told a press conference this morning. Switzerland has committed to providing $106m for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure recovery. Russia said Wednesday it was fully committed to preventing nuclear war, and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons was its highest priority. The Russian foreign ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering “on the brink of a direct armed conflict” and that the west must stop “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences”. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. US National security council spokesperson John Kirby said the US believed North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia and “trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or north Africa”. Putin called for weapons used by Russia’s military to be modernised during a meeting of his coordination council on Wednesday. “Weapons must constantly, continuously improve and remain effective. To achieve this, I repeat, it is important to ensure that there is active competition between manufacturers and developers,” he said. The UN security council has overwhelmingly rejected Russia’s attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out “military biological” activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons. Details have been published of the damage caused to the Nord Stream gas pipeline by explosions at the end of September. Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820ft) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was “destroyed”. Two Russian oligarchs and business partners of Roman Abramovich have been added to the UK government’s sanctions list. Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were “known to be business associates” of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list.",

Here’s a quick recap of where we stand: The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update on Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff said he expected Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Russia’s defence ministry claimed earlier on Tuesday that Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has called for the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant on the frontline of Russia’s war in Ukraine. In a long-awaited report that detailed extensive damage there, the IAEA said it was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the “dominance of Washington prevailed” and that political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise. The UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership, Lavrov said, while also mocking her for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the pro-Russian mayor’s office said on Telegram, while blaming Ukraine. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, according to Ukraine’s top officials. Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said western allies are “putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely”. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. The designation of Russia as a state sponsor of terror – a label Ukraine has pushed for – could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges. The sentencing of Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, shocked friends and supporters who gathered in court on Monday to protest against his imprisonment. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant published a front-page editorial in support of Safronov on Tuesday. Also on Monday, a court in Moscow stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same Russian court then revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, “No” (“But”), on Tuesday. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. Russia is burning excess gas because it has no capacity to store it after cutting deliveries to Europe, the EU’s energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Indonesia, Simson said: Our satellites are registering the leak of natural gas or them flaring the natural gas and this is very polluting. They don’t have alternative pipeline connections to other regions in the world, and their own underground gas storage is full. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. Biden had said previously that Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for. The designation of Russia as state sponsor of terror could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update, the general staff said: Units of the Defence Forces of Ukraine hold their positions and prevent the enemy from advancing deeper into the territory of Ukraine. It added: Our military successfully repelled enemy attacks in the areas of Dolyna, Soledar, Novobakhmutivka, Kodema, Zaitseve, Avdiivka, Mariinka, and Lyubomirivka settlements of Donetsk region. The Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. At a briefing with reporters, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said: What we’ve seen in the Kherson region first is some continued offensive operations by the Ukrainians. They continue to make some forward movement. We are aware that they have retaken some villages. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, he added. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Writing on Telegram, Dmytro Orlov said: Today at 12:20 residents of Enerhodar reported about a powerful explosion in the city. After that, the electricity and water supply disappeared simultaneously in Enerhodar. Earlier today, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. In its daily military briefing, the Kremlin said three shells landed on the territory of the nuclear power station. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the mayor’s office said on Telegram. Bardin’s car exploded in “the very centre of Berdiansk” near the building of the civil-military administration, it said. The mayor’s office said: Today, September 6, in the very centre of Berdiansk, near the building of the Military Civil Administration, the car of the city commandant Artem Bardin was blown up. As a result of the explosion, the city commandant was hospitalised in severe condition. Doctors are providing him with necessary medical care. Although it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, pro-Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine. The pro-Russian mayor’s office said: The terrorists of the Kyiv regime continue to try to intimidate residents of the liberated territories. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here’s more on the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency after the UN nuclear watchdog sent a team to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last week. The IAEA called for the establishment of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear power plant, calling the current situation “untenable”. The report states: There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. The UN agency urged that shelling on site and its vicinity “should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities”. In addition to establishing a security zone around the plant, the IAEA recommended that the conditions Ukrainian staff operating the plant are working in should be improved. The report says: Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available. This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff has said he expects Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. Serhiy Leshchenko wrote on Twitter: Tonight there is going to be a great news from President Zelenskyy on counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region. He did not give any further details. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned there is an “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. In its report, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the facility and that ongoing shelling near the plant “represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security”. The backup power line at the Zaporizhzhia power plant was disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the IAEA said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the “dominance of Washington prevailed” and that political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise. The UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership, Lavrov said, while also mocking her for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, according to Ukraine’s top officials. Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said western allies are “putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely”.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The team of UN nuclear experts “closely” witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant during their visit to the facility, the IAEA report says. They also first-hand observations of damage to the road surface, walls and windows of various buildings, as well as at the overpass connecting the reactor units at the plant. The report continues: The shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, stated that “while past events had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, they represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security because critical safety functions could be impacted”, it says. The International Atomic Energy Agency has published its report about the nuclear safety and security situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog warns that there is “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the nuclear plant, adding that it was “gravely concerned” concerned about the situation at the facility. The situation in Ukraine is “unprecedented”, the report writes. It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power programme. A nuclear accident can have serious impacts within the country and beyond its borders. The IAEA added: Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. Ukraine has urged Hasidic Jewish pilgrims travelling to the war-torn country to skip their annual pilgrimage to the city of Uman this year because of the Russian invasion. Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims come to Uman from all around the world to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashana – the Jewish new year, celebrated this year between 25 and 27 September, Agence France-Presse reports. Rabbi Nachman from Breslov (1772-1810) was the founder of an ultra-orthodox movement that settled in Uman in the early 1800s. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian embassy in Israel said: “When the echoes of the Russian enemy explosions on Ukraine don’t stop, we must take care of ourselves. “Please, avoid coming to Uman on Rosh Hashanah and pray that peace will return to Ukraine and the blessed pilgrimage will be renewed.” Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew. More than 10,000 pilgrims from around the world are expected according to regional governor Igor Taburets, who was cited by Interfax-Ukraine. Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew, including a ban on street vending and public gatherings because of the “high risk of a terrorist attack”, Taburets said. He added: We know how sly our enemy is. Any public gathering is potentially vulnerable.” Three Royal Navy warships have been shadowing a Russian Navy taskforce in waters close to the UK, PA Media reports. Type 23 frigates HMS Westminster, HMS Lancaster and HMS Richmond tracked Slava-class cruiser, Marshal Ustinov, the sister ship of the ill-fated Moskva which sunk in the Black Sea in April. They have also been keeping a watch on Udaloy-class destroyer, Vice-Admiral Kulakov and tanker Vyazma as the three ships headed home from the eastern Mediterranean after supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February. At the same time, patrol ship HMS Mersey has also shadowed Russian military research vessel Akademik Ioffe on its journey south through the Dover shipping lanes into the Channel. A Royal Navy spokesman said: The frigates and their helicopters used an array of cutting-edge sensors and modern naval technology to keep close watch in the Celtic Sea and through the English Channel.” HMS Westminster’s commanding officer (CO) Commander Ed Moss-Ward said: Maritime security in the sea areas around the UK is crucial to our prosperity and resilience. The Royal Navy routinely responds to escort warships in UK territorial waters and the adjacent sea areas to ensure compliance with maritime law, to deter malign activity and to protect our national interests. Escorting the Russian task group has demonstrated that the Royal Navy is committed to maintaining maritime security and to co-operating with our Nato allies.” HMS Lancaster shadowed the Russian ships from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Celtic Sea as part of Nato’s fast response task force in the Atlantic. HMS Westminster deployed from Portsmouth to intercept the Russian ships in the Celtic Sea where the Marshal Ustinov was refuelled by the tanker Vyazma while HMS Richmond kept watch in the Channel. Commander Tom Johnson, CO of HMS Lancaster, said: Working together allows Nato allies to respond to security challenges at pace and collectively deter potential aggressors. Exchange of personnel further deepens Nato cohesion and interoperability so that the alliance can swiftly and efficiently react to any threat. Lancaster’s team work exceptionally hard to ensure we are always ready to respond to any threat at a moment’s notice.” My colleague Isobel Koshiw writes: A chimpanzee that escaped Kharkiv city zoo on Monday was persuaded to return by a zoo employee who wheeled it back on a bicycle. Staff at the zoo in Ukraine’s second-biggest city were struggling to persuade Chichi, who had wandered around streets and a nearby park, to return to the zoo with them. But when it started to rain she ran to a keeper, who put a yellow jacket on her. The pair embraced before Chichi was put on the seat of a bike. Footage of the incident brought a rare moment of joy to a frontline city under daily bombardment by Russian forces. The zoo’s director, Oleksiy Hryhoriev, confirmed to Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne that the animal was safely back in the zoo. Earlier in the war, Chichi had been evacuated from the Feldman Ecopark, an outdoor zoo on frontlines in the Kharkiv region. Read the full story here. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant have published a front-page editorial in support of the journalist Ivan Safronov, who was yesterday sentenced to 22 years in prison on treason charges. The open letter to Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant, pays tribute to how he became “the best in his field” and states that colleagues at the newspaper were “lucky to work with you”. The letter writes that the authors “haven’t heard any public evidence of your guilt”, adding: You didn’t give up – and don’t give up now. […] We love you, we believe in you. We are waiting for you. Safronov’s sentencing on Monday shocked friends and supporters who gathered in the Russian court to protest against his imprisonment. He was tried on secret evidence, but case files revealed by Proekt showed that much of the case against him came from public data in his articles and alleged ties to foreigners that were not backed up by evidence. The actors Ben Stiller and Sean Penn have been banned from entering Russia following their outspoken support of Ukraine during the invasion. Russia’s minister of foreign affairs released a list on Monday of 25 new names that will be excluded from the country in response to “the ever-expanding personal sanctions by the … Biden administration against Russian citizens”. Stiller and Penn are both included, along with political figures such as senators Mark Kelly, Rick Scott and Kyrsten Sinema. Stiller, an ambassador for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, visited Ukraine in June, and posted a video on Instagram in solidarity with refugees of the conflict, saying: “Nobody chooses to flee their homes. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.” Stiller also met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, telling him: “You’re my hero.” Penn has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine and Zelenskiy, having been in the country making a documentary as the Russian invasion got under way in February. Penn later made a series of TV appearances in April to call for US solidarity with Ukraine and asked for US fighter jets to be supplied to the country. He also said he had considered joining the fight against Russia. They join a longer list of more than 1,000 names of US citizens who have been sanctioned by Russia; these mostly comprise political and military figures (including President Biden and Hillary Clinton, but not Donald Trump), but also a handful of Hollywood names, including executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Peter Cramer, film director Rob Reiner, and actor Morgan Freeman. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. Haidai wrote: Luhansk Region continues to defend itself. Enemy attacks have been repulsed, there are certain positive results: our defenders have advanced a little and gained a foothold. We are waiting for the de-occupation. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. More from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who accused the west of not honouring its promise to help Russian food exports reach global markets, according to Russian state media. Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti cited Lavrov as claiming that western countries had not relaxed sanctions that would allow it easier access to ship its agricultural products abroad. Russia had seen the commitment as a key part of an UN-brokered grain deal that helped end a blockade on Ukrainian grain exports from its southern ports. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Asked what needed to happen for the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to begin pumping again, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters: Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this. She said the US had long sought to break the energy ties between Russia and major European powers such as Germany. Political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries, she added. The “dominance of Washington prevailed”, Zakharova said. She added: It is absolute suicide but it seems they will have to go through this. A court in Moscow has revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, a day after the newspaper was stripped of its print media licence and effectively banned from operating inside Russia. On Monday, the Basmanny district court revoked Novaya Gazeta of its licence after Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Speaking outside court yesterday, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief and Nobel laureate Dmitry Muratov said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same court today revoked the licence of “No” (“But”), because of its failure to appear from 2009, when it was registered, until 2022. Novaya Gazeta lawyer Yaroslav Kozheurov said: Why did Roskomnadzor go to court only after the magazine was printed? It is absolutely clear that the appeal to the court is not due to the fact that the magazine was not published, but due to the fact that the magazine started appearing. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. In March, Novaya Gazeta said it would cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received several warnings from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials. “It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the country’s effort to establish the international tribunal. Smyrnov said: They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres. We know that agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on. His claims come as the US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that Russia should not be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Ukrainian officials and some US politicians had pushed for. Russia had previously said such a designation would mean Washington had crossed the point of no return. Ukrainian officials say that since April, they have been trying to convince their western allies to establish an ad hoc tribunal that would hold Russia’s senior leadership responsible for the crime of aggression for invading Ukraine. Aggression is viewed as the supreme crime under international law because without the transgression of borders during an invasion, subsequent war crimes would not have been committed. Read the full story by my colleagues, Isobel Koshiw and Patrick Wintour. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise and said the UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the incoming prime minister tried to “defend Britain’s interests without taking into account the positions of others in any way and without any attempt to compromise”, he said. Lavrov added: I do not think that this will help Britain to maintain or strengthen its position in the international arena, which has clearly been shaken after it left the European Union. He also mocked the incoming prime minister for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. He said: For Liz Truss ... it should be more of a priority to deal with her closest neighbours, including finally deciding whether President Macron is her friend or enemy. This question is still hanging in the air. Lavrov said the UK had tried to “compensate” for Brexit by taking “drastic steps on the world stage” and was acting “aggressively over the situation in Ukraine”. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Jane Clinton to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries. Participating countries in the military drills included several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson occupiers to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said European Union politicians are being “suicidal” over Russian energy supplies, Reuters reports. Russian president Vladimir Putin was shown smiling and joking with his defence minister as he inspected a military exercise in Russia’s far east. The “Vostok” (East) exercises also involve troops from China and India, although it was not clear if units from those countries were taking part in the exercise observed by Putin. The Zvezda military news service showed a clip of Putin seated next to defence minister Sergei Shoigu, both were wearing military combat jackets and were seen exchanging a joke as they listened to a phone call between Shoigu’s deputy and the head of the general staff, Reuters reports. The defence ministry says the four-yearly war games that began on 1 September involve only 50,000 troops, a fraction of the 300,000 they said took part in 2018. Western military analysts say they believe both figures are exaggerated. The defence ministry released a video of the naval part of the exercise, showing Russia’s Pacific Fleet practising launching Kalibr cruise missiles which it said had successfully struck a target more than 300km (185 miles) away. On Monday, Russian and Chinese combat ships practised repelling an enemy air attack using air defence artillery systems. India has sent an army contingent to the drills which it says is taking part in “joint field training exercises, combat discussions and firepower exercises”. Russia is the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. Moscow says the war games also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and six former Soviet republics. The Swiss government has agreed to offer financial help to the publicly owned electricity group Axpo, Agence France-Presse reports. It is the latest European energy company to require state aid after Russia’s war in Ukraine sent gas prices soaring. Axpo, which requested temporary government help last week, will have access to credit line of 4bn Swiss francs ($4.1bn) to ensure liquidity amid the energy crisis. The Federal Energy Office said: The government responded favourably to avoid putting Switzerland’s energy supply in jeopardy.” It added that Axpo was an electricity firm of “systemic importance” for the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. He said European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Agence France-Presse reports. Erdoğan added: Europe’s attitude towards Mr Putin, its sanctions, brought Mr Putin – willingly or not – to the point of saying: ‘If you do this, I will do that.’ He is using all his means and weapons. Natural gas, unfortunately, is one of them.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline on “sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. The prison service did not respond to a request for comment. Navalny’s cell is reported to be two by three metres wide with a table, chair and bed which is folded from 6am to 10pm. His chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, told Reuters: Suddenly, three weeks ago, they started to dramatically worsen his conditions, which actually poses an enormous threat to his health, because no normal person could spend a long time in that ‘special’ cell. And for Alexei, who had just survived the poisoning, it is especially dangerous.” Volkov, who keeps in touch with the opposition leader through lawyers, said that Navalny is still “mentally and physically very fit”. He added: The fact that Putin is losing (the war), and is getting less and less predictable, makes the situation more dangerous.” Navalny is serving eleven-and-a-half years in prison for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court charges, which he denies. His Anti-Corruption Foundation is preparing to turn the upcoming local elections in Moscow into an anti-war vote. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom’s deputy chief executive Vitaly Markelov has told Reuters. Gazprom said on Friday that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would remain shut as a turbine at a compressor station had an engine oil leak, sending wholesale gas prices soaring. When asked when Nord Stream 1 would start pumping gas again, Markelov said: “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first.” Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. In a written statement, Siemens Energy said: We cannot comprehend this new representation based on the information provided to us over the weekend. Therefore, until further notice, our assessment is that the finding communicated to us does not represent a technical reason for stopping operation. Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site.” Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum said it has signed a bridge financing arrangement with Finnish government investment company Solidium for €2.35bn ($2.34bn/£2.02bn) to cover collateral needs in the Nordic power commodity market. It comes after the Finnish government on Sunday unveiled plans to offer up to €10bn in guarantees to the power industry after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, worsening Europe’s energy shortage. Fortum chief executive Markus Rauramo said in a statement: The ongoing energy crisis in Europe is caused by Russia’s decision to use energy as a weapon and it is now also severely affecting Fortum and other Nordic power producers.” The Finnish government said: The arrangement is aimed at strengthening Fortum’s liquidity reserves and thereby securing Finnish energy supply.” The first instalment of the one-year loan would be €350m and it needs to be withdrawn by 30 September for the arrangement to remain effective, Fortum said. The effective annual interest cost for the bridge financing, including arrangement and commitment fees, would be 14.2%, it added. Russia’s economy is expected to contract by 2.9% this year before returning to growth in 2023-24, according to its economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov, as quoted by the Tass news agency. In its base case scenario, Russia’s economy ministry said it expected a 0.9% GDP contraction in 2023, up from predictions of a 2.7% decline made just last month, Reuters reports. Reshetnikov said the economy would return to periods of growth on a quarterly basis from as early as the end of this year. The economy ministry also forecast 2.6% growth in 2024, down from 3.7% it had predicted in August. Reshetnikov said the economy was on course to post GDP growth in excess of 3% a year after 2024. This new forecast is a significant improvement from the predictions made just last month when the economy ministry forecast a 4.2% contraction for 2022 and a 2.7% fall in GDP in 2023. Reshetnikov said expectations had improved as the Russian economy continued to weather the fallout from western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine better than expected. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Kharkiv. Russian energy giant Gazprom said it will ship 42.4m cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a figure unchanged from Monday, Reuters reports. Further reaction from the Kremlin on its expectations of relations with Britain under the soon-to-be new prime minister, Liz Truss. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the state TASS agency: Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister... one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected.” In his farewell speech from Downing Street in London this morning, outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson referenced the early delivery of weapons to Ukraine. PA Media reports that Johnson added that the “early supplies of weapons to the heroic Ukrainian armed forces” may “very well have helped change the course of the biggest European war of 80 years”. He praised his government for getting “this economy moving again from July last year despite all the opposition”. Johnson continued: We have and will continue to have that economic strength to give people the cash they need to get through this energy crisis that has been caused by Putin’s vicious war. … And if Putin thinks that he can succeed by blackmailing or bullying the British people, then he is utterly deluded.” UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace will be going to Germany this week to discuss longer-term funding for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence says. President Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries, Kremlin, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told local news agencies. Agence France-Presse reports: Putin was meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu and military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov at the Sergeevski military range and could observe the final phase of the military exercises later, Peskov was quoted as saying. The military drills, called Vostok-2022, started on 1 September and are due to take place until 7 September across several training grounds in Russia’s far east and in the waters off its eastern coast. According to Moscow, more than 50,000 soldiers and more than 5,000 units of military equipment, including 140 aircraft and 60 ships, will be involved in the drills. Participating countries include several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Similar drills were last held in 2018. The latest from the UK’s Ministry of Defence: Ukraine’s offensive operations in the Kherson region continued over the weekend. On 05 September 2022, the Odesa Journal reported 27 sorties by Russian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the west bank of the Dnipro, compared to an average of 50 a day throughout August. On 21 August 2022, Ukrainian forces reported shooting down three Russian Orlan-10 tactical UAVs in a single day. In recent years, Russian doctrine has given an increasingly prominent role for UAVs, particularly to spot targets for its artillery to strike. UAVs can be vulnerable to both kinetic effects – where they are directly shot down – and to electronic jamming. In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain stocks of UAVs, exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders’ tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.” A senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has claimed Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country. Counteroffensive actions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are taking place not only in the south of Ukraine, but also in the east and southeast,” Oleksiy Arestovych said on his Telegram channel late on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the operation to liberate the south of Ukraine, our military has liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper. These are subtle movements on the map. But the beginning of counteroffensive actions on different sectors of the front on our part speaks of a change in the situation as a whole.” Arestovych claimed Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper are in “operational encirclement”, and predicted that within a month their position will be “extremely difficult”. Gazprom has introduced some confusion around the reasons for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline. Yesterday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told journalists that sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” were to blame for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “Other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don’t exist,” Peskov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying. But Reuters reported on Tuesday that Gazprom’s deputy chief executive officer, Vitaly Markelov, went back to the original reason for the closure – maintenance problems – when he said it would not open until Siemens Energy repaired faulty equipment. “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first,” Markelov said on the sidelines of Eastern Economic Forum in Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok, when asked about when the pipeline could start pumping gas again. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on Monday that the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. US intelligence officials believe that the Russians could look to purchase additional North Korean military equipment in the future. The intelligence finding was first reported by the New York Times. The finding comes after the Biden administration recently confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. US president Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. Asked if Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday: “No.” Some US lawmakers have also pressed for the designation. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. A statement released on Monday read: Director General Grossi will on Tuesday issue a report about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine – including the findings from the mission to the ZNPP – and later the same day brief the United Nations Security Council about the mission to the plant.” Zaporizhzhia city administrative head, Oleksandr Starukh, said via his Telegram channel on Monday: Today, the IAEA mission left the Zaporizhzhya NPP, so we are currently waiting not only for a report on the current situation, but for clear decisions. The nuclear power plant and the area around it must be demilitarised as soon as possible.” Ukraine’s president President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that the conclusions of the mission should be presented on Tuesday, adding: “I hope they will be objective.” The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine,” Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later today. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson separatists to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Ukraine has repelled Russian offensives in the east as well as hindering Russian positions near Kramatorsk, a key town in eastern Donetsk region, its armed forces claimed. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. In a rare acknowledgment of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, Russia said it pushed back assaults in Kherson. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. “Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine.” As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid, Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Four of the six UN mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left the site, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, it said. The agency is drawing up a report to be released this week. Liz Truss’s imminent arrival as British prime minister has been greeted with scorn from the Kremlin and praise in Ukraine. “I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse,” Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with Britain. “But unfortunately, this cannot be ruled out.” Ukrainian politicians offered an exuberant welcome. “In Liz, we Truss” tweeted Ukrainian deputy Rustem Umerov. “Mrs Truss is a solid supporter of Ukraine. Hope for a fruitful ongoing partnership between the UK and Ukraine.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “looking forward to the start of cooperation” with Truss. Ukraine has sought political backing in Brussels for the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian military and political leaders for their role in the war. Several Ukrainian leaders attending a conference on war crimes accountability in the European capital on Monday argued for a court dedicated to prosecuting high-level Russian perpetrators, in addition to the International Criminal Court. Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said, as gas prices surged on Monday and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” A Russian court has sentenced journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges, a record sentence that has shocked those who gathered to protest against his imprisonment. Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, was tried on secret evidence. A court in Moscow also stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a “Russian World”, a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. The 31-page “humanitarian policy”, published on Monday, says Russia should “protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World”.",

Not far away, partially covered in a sheet, another person appeared to be kneeling, collapsed next to the wheelie case they had been pulling.</p> \n<p>Two women, limbs broken and twisted, lay where it appeared they had been talking next to a car in a queue of shattered vehicles that had been waiting to form into a convoy that – in a grim irony – would have taken them into Russian-occupied territory to the south, approved to enter by Russian forces.</p> \n<p>While some had died instantly, others had managed to escape their cars and stagger a few brief steps before succumbing. Police and soldiers zipped the bodies of the dead into black bags and searched through wallets and handbags to find identification.</p> \n<p>At 7.15am on Friday, dozens of cars had gathered to wait for a routine convoy to set off for the Russian-occupied territory that begins 12 miles away. About 150 cars are allowed each day by the Russians to make the journey south heading for cities such as Mariupol and Melitopol.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac61f82169ddefc35ada983d6ba436a0238d3543\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac61f82169ddefc35ada983d6ba436a0238d3543/0_0_6230_4153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath of the missile strike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of the missile strike on Friday morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kateryna Klochko/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The cars and minivans were full of items to bring to families still in the south – bedding and children’s toys, clothes and food. Some travellers would have hoped to pick up relatives to bring them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory amid fears that Russia’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/putin-russia-war-annexes-ukraine-regions\">annexation of four regions</a> in Ukraine will leave many trapped.</p> \n<p>At that moment, a Russian S-300 missile ploughed into the ground 10 metres from the cars as they waited for an escort for their journey. The blast tore through metal, shattered windscreens and blew out the windows of food kiosks and shops over a wide distance.</p> \n<p>Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the local governor’s office, told the Guardian what had happened. “[The car parts market] is a logistic hub to allow people go into the temporarily Russian-occupied territories. The Russians only accept 150 cars a day so that’s why we created a programme where people could go there to register and get their number in the line.</p> \n<p>“At 7.15 this morning there were a large number of cars waiting for their turn to cross, mostly people who want to go to and drop off aid to relatives. Maybe pick up people who want to leave on the way back.</p> \n<p>“That was the queue they hit with an S-300 missile. There’s no doubt it is a deliberate war crime. They always say they are aiming at a military object and hit something else. But there are no military objects near that site. That’s why there’s no doubt that it’s a terrorist act.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f460d9e23df131d3d28b42d9a64b749a81b0d357\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f460d9e23df131d3d28b42d9a64b749a81b0d357/0_0_4751_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The body of one of the victims lies covered by a blanket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The body of one of the victims lies covered by a blanket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With scores of injured removed to local hospitals, emergency workers carried on with the grim task of identification and removal of bodies.</p> \n<p>Among the dead were eight people who were travelling with drivers from Help People, a Ukrainian NGO, including a three-month-old child. The group’s founder, Alex Voronin, said they had intended to travel to Melitopol to meet family members.</p> \n<p>“We had a car and a minibus going to Melitopol. Out of that group, two survived, a nine-year-old boy and his mother, but we don’t know their condition. They were going to their family who live there. They were trying to get home and get stuff and help relatives get evacuated.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Every day there are a lot of vans going to Melitopol and Mariupol, but the rules of the Russians have been becoming more strict. There’s only one road – the green corridor, we call it.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/09/ukraine_zaporizhzhia_map/giv-6562rPjBpNpO05b0/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/09/ukraine_zaporizhzhia_map/giv-6562rPjBpNpO05b0/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Standing on the road near the car park, Dalina Yakushava, 48, had arrived after the explosion to see if she could confirm her place in a convoy.</p> \n<p>“This is where people are told to come and register by the authorities to join a convoy. You register online but I came to make sure my permission had been received,” she said. “I live in Mariupol. We just drove our daughter to Poland but we need to go back because my parents are there. It’s terrible but it is our home. There were a lot of cars waiting to leave this morning because no one has been able to go into the occupied areas for the past week.”</p> \n<p>On Friday, the traffic was in both directions.

My parents are staying, which is a worry, but we wanted to leave because the Russians have said they will close the crossing to men from 1 October. We realised this might be our final chance. The Russians came to ask us if we were voting in the [sham] referendum.

                    "bodyText": "In the dirt car park of a sprawling car parts market just outside the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, the bodies told horrific stories of the moment a Russian missile struck a civilian convoy, killing 25 and injuring scores more. A man in late middle age was slumped inside his car, one hand holding the steering wheel. Not far away, partially covered in a sheet, another person appeared to be kneeling, collapsed next to the wheelie case they had been pulling. Two women, limbs broken and twisted, lay where it appeared they had been talking next to a car in a queue of shattered vehicles that had been waiting to form into a convoy that – in a grim irony – would have taken them into Russian-occupied territory to the south, approved to enter by Russian forces. While some had died instantly, others had managed to escape their cars and stagger a few brief steps before succumbing. Police and soldiers zipped the bodies of the dead into black bags and searched through wallets and handbags to find identification. At 7.15am on Friday, dozens of cars had gathered to wait for a routine convoy to set off for the Russian-occupied territory that begins 12 miles away. About 150 cars are allowed each day by the Russians to make the journey south heading for cities such as Mariupol and Melitopol. The cars and minivans were full of items to bring to families still in the south – bedding and children’s toys, clothes and food. Some travellers would have hoped to pick up relatives to bring them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory amid fears that Russia’s annexation of four regions in Ukraine will leave many trapped. At that moment, a Russian S-300 missile ploughed into the ground 10 metres from the cars as they waited for an escort for their journey. The blast tore through metal, shattered windscreens and blew out the windows of food kiosks and shops over a wide distance. Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the local governor’s office, told the Guardian what had happened. “[The car parts market] is a logistic hub to allow people go into the temporarily Russian-occupied territories. The Russians only accept 150 cars a day so that’s why we created a programme where people could go there to register and get their number in the line. “At 7.15 this morning there were a large number of cars waiting for their turn to cross, mostly people who want to go to and drop off aid to relatives. Maybe pick up people who want to leave on the way back. “That was the queue they hit with an S-300 missile. There’s no doubt it is a deliberate war crime. They always say they are aiming at a military object and hit something else. But there are no military objects near that site. That’s why there’s no doubt that it’s a terrorist act.” With scores of injured removed to local hospitals, emergency workers carried on with the grim task of identification and removal of bodies. Among the dead were eight people who were travelling with drivers from Help People, a Ukrainian NGO, including a three-month-old child. The group’s founder, Alex Voronin, said they had intended to travel to Melitopol to meet family members. “We had a car and a minibus going to Melitopol. Out of that group, two survived, a nine-year-old boy and his mother, but we don’t know their condition. They were going to their family who live there. They were trying to get home and get stuff and help relatives get evacuated.” He added: “Every day there are a lot of vans going to Melitopol and Mariupol, but the rules of the Russians have been becoming more strict. There’s only one road – the green corridor, we call it.” Standing on the road near the car park, Dalina Yakushava, 48, had arrived after the explosion to see if she could confirm her place in a convoy. “This is where people are told to come and register by the authorities to join a convoy. You register online but I came to make sure my permission had been received,” she said. “I live in Mariupol. We just drove our daughter to Poland but we need to go back because my parents are there. It’s terrible but it is our home. There were a lot of cars waiting to leave this morning because no one has been able to go into the occupied areas for the past week.” On Friday, the traffic was in both directions. A short drive away along the same road towards the Russian lines, hundreds of cars queued near a Ukrainian checkpoint waiting for an escort, their occupants relieved to be crossing over. At the front of the queue, Nadya Nekustorova was playing with her 11-month-old daughter, Maria, as her husband, Dymytro, watched. “We’re coming from Melitopol,” Nadya said. “We won’t go back until it is back under Ukrainian control. My parents are staying, which is a worry, but we wanted to leave because the Russians have said they will close the crossing to men from 1 October. We realised this might be our final chance. The Russians came to ask us if we were voting in the [sham] referendum. We said no so it seemed like we should leave.” “It was a joke,” said Dymytro. “They were all just voting for themselves. The voting paper was a piece of copied A4. There were no seals or numbers to identify the vote was genuine. It was all fake. My brother has rented a flat in Zaporizhzhia so we’ll stay with him.” Further down the line of cars, Alla Votovska, 68, and her son Viktor said they had waited for four days to come to the checkpoint from a village near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “Everyone is trying to leave,” said Viktor. “But they would only let a few cars leave from our village each day, so we had to keep coming back. Other people are trying to leave as well via the Crimea for Poland and Europe. Half of our village has left.” Suddenly the cars were moving, heading for Zaporizhzhia on a road that would take them past the dead whose convoy had not been so lucky.",

                    "bodyText": "Joe Biden is under pressure to declare a national climate emergency as temperatures soar across the US and Europe. Facing political gridlock in Washington, the president could make such an announcement – which would unlock federal resources to address the crisis – as soon as this week, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. Biden will visit a coal-turned-wind power plant in Massachusetts on Wednesday, to promote his climate action efforts. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Biden would announce “additional actions” to fight the climate crisis on Wednesday but ruled out the declaration of a national emergency for now. “He’s not going to just stop with the actions of tomorrow but I would not plan an announcement this week on national climate emergency,” Jean-Pierre said at the daily White House briefing. “Again, everything is on the table. It’s just not going to be this week on that decision … I don’t have a date circled on the calendar.” The president indicated last week that he would take steps to reduce carbon emissions after the West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin – a crucial swing vote in the evenly divided Senate – withdrew support for climate legislation Democrats had hoped to pass before leaving Washington for the August recess and as they face tough midterm elections in November. But the president’s ability to work around Congress remains limited and the impact of declaring a climate emergency, for all its symbolism, remains ambiguous. Lack of comprehensive action puts at risk goals to curb global heating. The Post’s report noted that some climate activists have argued that declaring an emergency would allow Biden “to halt crude oil exports, limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters, and direct agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency to boost renewable energy sources”. However, such measures could face legal challenges from Republicans critical of what they perceive as executive overreach. Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review magazine, tweeted in response to the report: “Yet again [the White House] advertises contempt for the rules of our constitutional republic.” The constraints were underlined last month when the supreme court effectively restricted the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing emissions rules involving matters of great “economic and political significance”. Democrats, however, are eager to see Biden take action as the planetary alarm rings ever louder: CNN reported that nearly 20% of the US population will probably see a temperature at or above 100F (37.7C) this week. Britain recorded its highest ever temperature of 104F (40C) as the heatwave gripping Europe intensified. Two Senate Democrats, Jeff Merkley and Sheldon Whitehouse, urged the president to declare a climate emergency and use the Defense Production Act – designed for use in wartime – to increase production of renewable energy products and systems including solar panels. Merkley tweeted: “[Biden] needs to go big on climate – starting by declaring a climate emergency so we can take bold action NOW on the disastrous impacts climate chaos has on our health, environment, and economy.” Whitehouse, who has called for tighter carbon regulations for vehicles and power plants and possible federal litigation against the fossil fuel industry, told reporters: “I’ve talked to the White House about going on offense and being aggressive and doing all the things that it is within the executive powers to do that have not so far been done.” The brutal contrast between political inaction and catastrophic global heating has led some to question whether America’s institutions of government are fit for purpose.

Last month they almost completely liberated the north-eastern Kharkiv region. On Saturday its governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Russia had shelled a civilian evacuation convoy, killing 20 people. They had been fleeing from Kupiansk, a town about 3.5 miles (6 km) from the frontline.</p> <p>The attack appears to have happened several days ago. The victims reportedly included several children. Footage showed bodies slumped in cars and the skeletons of two passengers sitting in front seats who appear to have been incinerated. Synyehubov said Moscow was guilty of “cruelty that can’t be justified”.</p> <p>On Thursday Russian troops attacked another convoy waiting to enter Russian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia, killing 30 civilians, including two children, and wounding dozens.</p> <p>In recent days Ukrainian battalions pushed further into occupied territory around Lyman. On Saturday Russia’s defences crumbled. It was unclear how many Russian-armoured vehicles managed to escape. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1576182678079950850\">Video showed the apparent aftermath of an artillery strike, with burnt-out vehicles by the side of a forest road, personal belongings strewn in the mud and dead Russian soldiers.</a></p> <p>The rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to have triggered Putin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/putin-to-sign-treaty-annexing-territories-in-ukraine-kremlin-says\">speech on Friday</a>, when he announced that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were now irrevocably part of Russia, after so-called “referendums” last week. The Kremlin controls almost all of Luhansk and Kherson provinces, but only parts of the other two regions.</p> <p>The UN, the US, UK and other western nations have condemned Russia’s attempted annexation as illegal and meaningless. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Kyiv will liberate all of its territory including Crimea. On Friday he formally applied for Ukraine to join Nato as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Kremlin has not commented on its stunning military rout in Lyman. Ukrainian commentators pointed out gleefully that Putin was the first invader in world history to announce the annexation of new territory at the same moment his troops were retreating from it.</p> <p>In Friday’s rambling and grudge-filled speech Putin denounced the west and portrayed his invasion of Ukraine as a just and necessary response to an attempt by the US and its allies to “colonise” Russia. He promised to “protect” the newly annexed lands “with all the forces at our disposal”.</p> <p>Zelenskiy has shrugged off Putin’s nuclear threats and made clear negotiations would only be possible with a new Russian leader.</p> <p>On Saturday he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1576118391387357184\">tweeted his thanks to President Biden</a>, and to bipartisan legislators in Washington, for the US’s latest $12.3bn support package for Ukraine.</p> <p>It includes 18 additional Himars long-range artillery systems. The high-precision weapon has played a critical role in Ukraine’s recent successful offensives, in the east and in the south around the occupied city of Kherson, where the Ukrainian army is squeezing fortified Russian positions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was seeking information following reports that a Russian patrol had abducted the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Moscow has occupied since March. Igor Murashov disappeared on his way to work on Friday. His whereabouts are unknown.</p> <p>Unverified reports suggested the Russians were seeking to force Murashov to work for Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy agency. He and about 7,000 other Ukrainian staff at the plant are employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear organisation, based in Kyiv.</p> <p>The plant’s six reactors are in cold storage. Rosatom experts sent from Moscow have been trying to connect the station with the Russian power grid, in order to supply energy to Crimea. “We have contacted Russian authorities and are requesting clarifications,” a IAEA spokesperson said.</p> <p>The sudden collapse of Russia’s forces in Lyman opens up the possibility of further Ukrainian gains. Ukrainian battalions can push north towards the town of Svatove or east to Kreminna, Haidai, the Luhansk governor, said. Beyond that are a cluster of cities which Russia seized over the summer after long pulverising battles – Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne and Lysychansk.</p> <p>In its Kharkiv region offensive Ukraine’s eastern command captured dozens of armoured vehicles left behind by fleeing Russians including T-90 tanks, fuel trucks, and mortars. It was unclear how much Russian equipment had been left behind in Lyman.</p>",

They had been fleeing from Kupiansk, a town about 3.5 miles (6 km) from the frontline. The attack appears to have happened several days ago. The victims reportedly included several children. Footage showed bodies slumped in cars and the skeletons of two passengers sitting in front seats who appear to have been incinerated. Synyehubov said Moscow was guilty of “cruelty that can’t be justified”. On Thursday Russian troops attacked another convoy waiting to enter Russian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia, killing 30 civilians, including two children, and wounding dozens. In recent days Ukrainian battalions pushed further into occupied territory around Lyman. On Saturday Russia’s defences crumbled. It was unclear how many Russian-armoured vehicles managed to escape. Video showed the apparent aftermath of an artillery strike, with burnt-out vehicles by the side of a forest road, personal belongings strewn in the mud and dead Russian soldiers. The rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to have triggered Putin’s speech on Friday, when he announced that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were now irrevocably part of Russia, after so-called “referendums” last week. The Kremlin controls almost all of Luhansk and Kherson provinces, but only parts of the other two regions. The UN, the US, UK and other western nations have condemned Russia’s attempted annexation as illegal and meaningless. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Kyiv will liberate all of its territory including Crimea. On Friday he formally applied for Ukraine to join Nato as soon as possible. The Kremlin has not commented on its stunning military rout in Lyman. Ukrainian commentators pointed out gleefully that Putin was the first invader in world history to announce the annexation of new territory at the same moment his troops were retreating from it. In Friday’s rambling and grudge-filled speech Putin denounced the west and portrayed his invasion of Ukraine as a just and necessary response to an attempt by the US and its allies to “colonise” Russia. He promised to “protect” the newly annexed lands “with all the forces at our disposal”. Zelenskiy has shrugged off Putin’s nuclear threats and made clear negotiations would only be possible with a new Russian leader. On Saturday he tweeted his thanks to President Biden, and to bipartisan legislators in Washington, for the US’s latest $12.3bn support package for Ukraine. It includes 18 additional Himars long-range artillery systems. The high-precision weapon has played a critical role in Ukraine’s recent successful offensives, in the east and in the south around the occupied city of Kherson, where the Ukrainian army is squeezing fortified Russian positions. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was seeking information following reports that a Russian patrol had abducted the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Moscow has occupied since March. Igor Murashov disappeared on his way to work on Friday. His whereabouts are unknown. Unverified reports suggested the Russians were seeking to force Murashov to work for Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy agency. He and about 7,000 other Ukrainian staff at the plant are employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear organisation, based in Kyiv. The plant’s six reactors are in cold storage. Rosatom experts sent from Moscow have been trying to connect the station with the Russian power grid, in order to supply energy to Crimea. “We have contacted Russian authorities and are requesting clarifications,” a IAEA spokesperson said. The sudden collapse of Russia’s forces in Lyman opens up the possibility of further Ukrainian gains. Ukrainian battalions can push north towards the town of Svatove or east to Kreminna, Haidai, the Luhansk governor, said. Beyond that are a cluster of cities which Russia seized over the summer after long pulverising battles – Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne and Lysychansk. In its Kharkiv region offensive Ukraine’s eastern command captured dozens of armoured vehicles left behind by fleeing Russians including T-90 tanks, fuel trucks, and mortars. It was unclear how much Russian equipment had been left behind in Lyman.",

The energy price cap has been raised to £1,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about £2,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off £200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years. The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, and 60% of Germany’s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion. Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine – Europe has paid more than €15bn (£12.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began. The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war. Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK’s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry. What will be in it? Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade. Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK’s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK’s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power. Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK’s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward. What about fracking? The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK’s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis. Could we go back to coal? Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK’s remaining coal operators – EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal – as a contingency. Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance. What will not be in the strategy?

Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an £11bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought. Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling. And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK’s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed. But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments. What is happening to fossil fuel companies? Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP’s chief boasting his company was a “cash machine”, and his finance chief that he has “more money than we know what to do with”. Dangerously for the Earth’s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal. But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security. What will all of this do to net zero? The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week. Are energy prices the only factor behind the cost-of-living crisis? No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers. But don’t expect this government to admit that.",

He described such tactics as “lawfare”.</p> <p>The Foreign Policy Centre said the UK was “<a href=\"https://fpc.org.uk/publications/unsafe-for-scrutiny\">the most frequent country of origin</a>” for foreign legal threats against investigative journalists.</p> <p><strong>How are Slapps connected to Russian oligarchs?</strong></p> <p>The use of Slapps is not confined to Russians but one of the most notorious recent examples, characterised as such by MPs as well as free speech campaigners, related to Putin’s People, a book written by the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/roman-abramovich-settles-libel-claim-over-putin-biography\">Catherine Belton about the Russian leader</a>.</p> <p>She and her publisher, HarperCollins, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/roman-abramovich-settles-libel-claim-over-putin-biography\">sued over a number of matters in the book</a> by multiple Russian billionaires, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich\">Roman Abramovich</a>, who owns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea football club</a>, Mikhail Fridman, the owner of Russia’s largest non-state bank, and the Russian state oil company Rosneft. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs.</p> <p>Read more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/04/what-are-slapps-and-how-are-they-connected-to-russian-oligarchs\">What are Slapps and how are they connected to Russian oligarchs?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62222f6b8f08d4a3a989ea8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-04T15:26:29.419Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1937a0308a44ac26d0b99aff46d1a96bd0e973a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1937a0308a44ac26d0b99aff46d1a96bd0e973a/0_20_4389_2633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extraordinary meeting of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairsepa09800506 Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation Jose Manuel Albares (R) and British Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs and Minister for Women and Equalities Elizabeth Truss chat prior to an extraordinary meeting of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs on the Russian aggression on Ukraine at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, 04 March 2022.

The BBC will “temporarily suspend” the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia. This is after new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which imposes a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been strongly condemned by both the foreign secretary Liz Truss and defence secretary Ben Wallace. Truss called it a “completely reckless act”. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day.The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. That’s it from us for today. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Here’s a bit more detail from Reuters about the legislation that has prompted the BBC to suspend its work in Russia: Russia’s upper house of parliament approved a draft law on Friday that would impose a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, the TASS news agency reported. The bill will become law once President Vladimir Putin signs it, as he is widely expected to do. Moscow says it is fighting back in what it casts as an information war with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile The Moscow Times reports that the document was adopted unanimously. Examples of “fakes” about military operations that are punishable by up to 15 years in prison were provided to the lawmakers including the use of old photos of burned military equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that have been photoshopped to have markings of the Russian military. The explanatory note to the bill also states that Ukrainian media is using footage of the devastation in the Donbas region from 2014-2015 and passing it off as crimes perpetrated by the Russian military in order to “create a global negative image of Russia as a ‘bloody aggressor’ and whip up panic in society.” The news about the BBC suspending operations in Russia comes amid a debate about the Kremlin-backed RT news channel, formerly known as Russia Today. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has opened 27 investigations into the “due impartiality” of programmes broadcast on the channel. Meanwhile culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said RT should lose its licence and “never again” be able to broadcast “poisonous propaganda”. But Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, warned earlier this week that the BBC risked being banned in Russia if RT was shut down in the UK. Reports that BBC News services were being blocked in Russia prompted the broadcaster to issue a statement on Friday morning, saying it would “continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world”. It also shared a link to an article reminding viewers that its Ukrainian and Russian language services are available on the dark web. The BBC has made its international news website available through the Tor network, a privacy-focused software used to access the dark web, in a bid to thwart censorship attempts. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The team is part of counter-terrorism command and has “national responsibility for carrying out any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”. Detectives are appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards to come forward, and are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine during this period, PA News reports. Evidence given to and gathered by the war crimes team may then be shared with the international criminal court to assist with their investigation. The BBC will “temporarily suspend” the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia. This follows the news that new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which BBC director general Tim Davie said appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. The Russian parliament approved the law on Friday. It would make it a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread “fake” or “false” news about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. It comes after the Kremlin accused the BBC of playing a “determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Davie said: It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. Davie said the safety of the BBC’s staff was paramount and they are are “not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs”. He continued: I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. As the UK government seeks ways to take on Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin’s regime, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. How do Slapps differ from ordinary defamation lawsuits? While Slapps generally arise out of defamation lawsuits and ostensibly have the same purpose – of protecting the claimant’s reputation – they are seen as an attempt to shut down public criticism, with the claimant often indifferent about whether they actually win the case. What is the threat posed by Slapps? The fear is that they discourage investigative reporting into rich and powerful people because of the potential costs of defending a claim, even if it has little or no merit. In a parliamentary debate on Slapps in January, David Davis, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said “nefarious” actors were using the justice system “to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations”. He described such tactics as “lawfare”. The Foreign Policy Centre said the UK was “the most frequent country of origin” for foreign legal threats against investigative journalists. How are Slapps connected to Russian oligarchs? The use of Slapps is not confined to Russians but one of the most notorious recent examples, characterised as such by MPs as well as free speech campaigners, related to Putin’s People, a book written by the journalist Catherine Belton about the Russian leader. She and her publisher, HarperCollins, were sued over a number of matters in the book by multiple Russian billionaires, including Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, Mikhail Fridman, the owner of Russia’s largest non-state bank, and the Russian state oil company Rosneft. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs. Read more here: Anas Sarwar praised the “inspirational bravery” of the Ukrainian people in the face of the Russian invasion. Having led applause in support of Ukraine earlier in the day, the Scottish Labour leader argued that Vladimir Putin “will not win” and insisted peace will prevail. Sarwar said: We unequivocally reject any - any - false attempts to justify Russian aggression, and we stand in solidarity with those fleeing war and those who are staying to defend their homeland. Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustifiable. Across the world today the message is clear - peace and democracy must prevail and we will not bend to Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions. We must provide more humanitarian assistance to defeat the horrors of war: hunger, destitution and need. We must further tighten the economic measures taken against Vladimir Putin’s regime and we must, once and for all, root out the free flow of Russian money and influence and the Russian disinformation campaign from our public life, across the UK and here in Scotland. The first minister of Wales has said that he regrets the ending of free coronavirus testing, but that it was inevitable after the UK government ended the programme. Mark Drakeford said he had attempted to persuade the UK government to take a “more gradual” approach to the running down of test and trace but had been rebuffed. Drakeford said: I think that is a genuine anxiety and it is why we have attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the UK government to take a more gradual approach to the rundown of testing and the infrastructure that has served us so well over the last two years, We will devote some of the testing that we have available to us through our own means in ways that will allow surveillance to continue. We continue to have conversations with the UK government about the need to ensure both that there is sufficient surveillance in place and that should it be necessary to step up the level of protection again through a more widespread testing regime, there’s a proper plan and proper capacity to be able to do that. In the end, when the UK government makes these decisions, they have a direct effect on us. We’ve had to plan within the constraints that we unavoidably face. Covid-19 infection levels have fallen in England and Northern Ireland but increased in Scotland, while the trend in Wales is “uncertain”, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS figures reveal that in England, around one in 30 people in private households are estimated to have had the virus in the week to 26 February, or 1.9 million people – down from one in 25, or 2.1 million people in the week to 19 February. For Northern Ireland the proportion of people with Covid-19 has fallen to one in 17, or 106,300 people, from one in 14, 132,700 people. But Scotland saw a slight increase week-on-week, up from one in 20, or 240,700 people, to one in 19, or 280,500. In Wales the estimate remains around one in 30, or 94,200, with the ONS describing the trend in the most recent week as “uncertain”. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day. The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. It said hundreds of thousands of members of the public donated to the humanitarian appeal within hours of its launch on Thursday. The total includes 20 million donated by the UK Government as part of its UK Aid Match scheme - the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through the initiative. Saleh Saeed, the chief executive of the DEC, said: We are also very grateful for the generous support of the royal family.” We also thank the UK Government who have matched pound for pound the first 20 million donated by the public, as well as our broadcast partners and celebrities for having aired and joined the appeal, reaching millions of viewers and listeners. Giving through the DEC is the most effective way to get the right assistance to the right people. While wanting to collect clothes and other items for people in need is laudable, the things people give today may not be what people need tomorrow and aid workers say they can’t use much of what is arriving. Donating through the DEC is the most helpful way people Ben Wallace accused Russia of “playing with fire” by shelling a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference in Copenhagen, the defence secretary added that the UK government “call upon the Russian president in the strongest possible terms to absolutely cease attacking sites” such as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. He said: It is incredibly dangerous. It is not just dangerous for Ukraine and Russia, it is dangerous for Europe, and it is playing with fire that really is beyond anything that has to do with logic or necessity. Liz Truss, who is in Brussels to meet with her counterparts to discuss next steps in responding to Russia’s aggression, has said the meeting will be used to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin”. The foreign secretary said: We are doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons – and we are also going to be talking about sanctions. We have been very co-ordinated in sanctions, we have shown huge unity, it is having a big effect in Russia – but we now need to do more. We particularly need to look at the oil and gas sector, how do we reduce our dependence across Europe on Russian gas, how do we cut off the funding to Vladimir Putin’s war machine? That is what I am going to be advocating at both the G7 and the discussions with the EU. The shelling of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine by Russian troops is “a threat to European security and stability”, Liz Truss has said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Speaking in Brussels, where ministers from across the West are gathering today to discuss how to respond to Russian aggression, the foreign secretary told journalists that those responsible for the “completely reckless act” must be “held to account”. Asked how concerned she is about the incident, Truss said: Well this was a completely reckless act. We’ve heard now that the fire has been extinguished, but it is extremely concerning that forces are prepared to do this. We have called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. This is a threat to European security and stability and we need those responsible to be held to account. Here’s more about what has happened at the nuclear plant: Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Speaking on a visit to the Polish border, the home secretary told reporters she was in the country “very much in terms of standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also with our friends here in Poland”. She said she wanted to “to see the work that they’re doing and also to see how we can support Poland much more in terms of helping those Ukrainians with links to the United Kingdom to come to Britain, and actually we’ve been discussing some of that work here today”. Patel said: We’re also launching our new family extension route today to enable Ukrainian families with links to the UK to come over to Britain. That scheme is live, that is now working, that’s up and running. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really [hard] night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him and a spokesman for the PM was asked whether Johnson was worried about attempts reportedly made on Zelenskiy’s life. He said: Of course, everybody’s concerned for the safety and welfare of the president of Ukraine and the rest of the government, as well as the people of Ukraine who we’ve seen indiscriminately targeted over recent days. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. He told an online event organised by the Chatham House thinktank: I am surprised that this morning, now that the Russian government have taken over a second nuclear power station in Ukraine, and now are in control of it, they have not made a statement that they will not allow that nuclear station to be used to endanger and to threaten human life. It is these very instances of Russia’s failure to respond to the pleas of the international community, that make us determined that we will step up our campaign to make sure that Russia is brought to justice for what is a crime of aggression but of course could – and I support the international criminal court’s actions – be in other areas too. Boris Johnson does not want someone in Russia to assassinate Vladimir Putin, HuffPost UK reports. Republican US senator Lindsey Graham last night called for the Russian president to be killed on Twitter, asking if there was a “Brutus” in Russia. For those who don’t know Brutus, Marcus Junius Brutus was a Roman politician and the most famous of Julius Caesar’s assassins. Asked if the Johnson agreed with Graham, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: No. We stand with the Ukrainian people in demanding the immediate end to the Russian invasion. We have said before Putin must be held account in front of an international court for the horrific acts he has committed. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said Graham’s comments, see below, were “unacceptable and outrageous”. The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian that further sanctions were being considered, which could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally-friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. You can read the full story here: Former prime minister Gordon Brown has called on countries to support the creation of a special tribunal to punish Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. He joined Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba at an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank, where pleas were made for Western nations to set up a tribunal to prosecute the Russian president and his accomplices, PA Media reports. Brown said the plan to set up a new international tribunal is modelled on the actions of the nations which met in London during the Second World War to draft a resolution on Nazi war crimes, which led to the creation of the international military tribunals and the Nuremberg trials. Brown said a new international tribunal is needed as well as existing international investigations by the international criminal court. The former Labour leader said: Ukraine wants our full support to expose and punish the crime of aggression, and that can be done by setting up a special tribunal on the lines proposed in 1942. President Putin has posed a fateful challenge to the post-1945 international order. He has sought to replace the rule of law with a misuse of force. If we were to acquiesce in any way, none of us could ever take freedom or democracy for granted ever again. For all these reasons, and because of the scale of the suffering of the people of Ukraine, I believe that most people would agree that this act of aggression cannot go uninvestigated, unprosecuted or unpunished. The proposal Brown is supporting has been formulated by senior international legal experts who are demanding that the UK and other countries join Ukraine to grant jurisdiction to a dedicated criminal tribunal to investigate both the perpetrators of the crime of aggression and those complicit in that crime. Brown added: Currently the ICC can investigate crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. As evidence mounts acts against innocent civilians including children and the use of vapour bombs, it may be that Russia can be prosecuted for these crimes. But we lack a crucial extra weapon in the legal fight against Putin. because Russia has not signed up to a separate ICC statute under which nations pledge not to commit so-called ‘crimes of aggression’. We need the special tribunal. Mr Kuleba wants us to act and I believe we must do so now. Putin must not be able to escape justice. Keir Starmer said it was clear Ukraine wanted the strongest possible response from Nato members, adding that the people of the country were “bravely” fighting back. Asked for his view of Vladimir Putin’s state of mind and the way he was acting, the Labour leader answered: Putin is a dangerous aggressor who is in breach of international law. I think he is gambling that Ukraine and our allies, the United Kingdom and Nato would not be united. He will be surprised by how united we are. Keir Starmer called for Conservative fundraiser and co-chair Ben Elliot to be sacked for his role in links between the Tories and Russian money. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington following his party’s byelection success, the Labour leader, said there was “growing concern” about the links between the Conservative Party and Russian money. He said: Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it. Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugee – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chairwoman, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. Read the full story here: Keir Starmer has said Labour wants to see a rule brought in to force oligarchs to register assets over a “very, very short” period measured in days. The Labour leader said: Otherwise what will happen – it’s inevitable – is that people will remove their assets ... they will remove and sell their properties in the UK, and put the money somewhere else. This is the powerful weapon we have to support Ukraine. We’ve got to use it. I say to the government – get rid of the 18-month timeline. Bring it down to a number of days and we will vote it through on Monday. The strongest provisions, we will be united in voting through. But I don’t want to see the government slowing down here or losing the ambition to take that opportunity. Liz Truss said the UK government was doing “all we can to support the Ukrainians”. Speaking in Brussels, the foreign secretary said she was holding various meetings to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin, in stopping Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine”. We’re doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons, where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons, and we’re also going to be talking about sanctions. She said sanctions were having a “big effect in Russia” but she said she was looking at how to speed up the process. We’ve sanctioned more companies than our counterparts across the world, we’ve just sanctioned two more major oligarchs last night. What I’m doing is looking how we can speed up that process to make even more progress on that front. The number one thing (that’s) important though, is that we are unified with our partners across the world in putting the toughest ever sanctions we’ve had on Russia. Asked for his view of the UK government’s efforts to sanction Russian oligarchs, Keir Starmer said the government could go “further and faster”. The Labour leader said: Where the government is taking action on sanctions, we support them. But they have got to go further and faster. We must go after every oligarch. This is the weapon we have to use and we need to use it now. I am particularly concerned about the arrangements where the government is suggesting there could be 18 months for those overseas owners to register their assets and their ownership. That gives them 18 months to remove their assets from this country, so I want to see the government move on this. Keir Starmer says it seems there is evidence of war crimes and that those responsible needed to be held to account. Asked how Nato and western governments could stop the escalating attacks on Ukraine, the Labour leader said: We need the retreat from the Russian aggression in Ukraine – it’s as simple as that. Every day we are seeing these attacks and the devastation that they are bringing about. Starmer said of Putin: From what I’ve already seen, it seems to me there is evidence of war crimes and it’s very important that all of those responsible are held to account. What’s really important now is the gathering of evidence to make sure that the most powerful case can be brought whenever it can be brought. Keir Starmer described the overnight attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine as “deeply alarming”. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader said: I think the whole world will be shocked. I think it’s very important that we unite now and renew that message that Russia must withdraw. We need a ceasefire – and we need to stop this aggression from Russia because this escalation is deeply, deeply concerning. Meanwhile, the head of the UN’s atomic watchdog said there has been no release of radioactive material at the Ukrainian nuclear plant following shelling by Russian forces. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary said. Dominic Raab was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. The deputy prime minister said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC [international criminal court] is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. The Welsh government is to provide £4m in aid to Ukraine. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, who told Sky News that Wales hoped to be “a nation of sanctuary” for Ukrainian refugees, said the aid would help people on the frontline. He told the programme: We know that cash is what is really needed here and now on the ground for people who can obtain those goods and put that money to good use - and that is why the £4m from the Welsh government will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal that we launched here in Wales yesterday. He could not say how many refugees that Wales could be dealing with and that many of them might like to stay near family or friends who may live elsewhere. He said: What we would like to see through the UK government is a simple, fast, safe and legal route for those needing to seek sanctuary elsewhere in the world and in Wales to be able to come here. For those people for whom Wales could be even a temporary home, a temporary place of sanctuary, we will want to do everything we can to welcome them and to provide for them. The UK has got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Vladimir Putin, the Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, has said. She told Sky News: I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people. She rejected the government’s claims that it has been working strongly against economic levers for Putin-linked individuals. She said: I have got to say that, for many, many years, Labour has been calling on the Conservatives to, for example, force transparency around property ownership, especially in London where we know that many of these Putin-linked oligarchs have been stashing their funds in property. We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency. We should have had it many years ago but, above all, we need it right now. We have got to act right now and we have got to stop dragging our feet as the Conservative government has been doing. Keir Starmer has tweeted his congratulations to Paulette Hamilton, Labour’s new MP for Birmingham Erdington. Hamilton won the byelection with a majority of 3,266 and is the city’s first black MP. The Labour leader said in the tweet that she had “made history”. He added: “As a dedicated community champion I know that you will bring security, prosperity and respect to the people of Erdington.” In her victory speech last night, Hamilton said: I’m truly humbled and honoured to be elected as a member of parliament. I will not take your vote for granted, I have met many of you and I have heard what you have to say and I commit to you now, I will work for you … I will be your voice in Westminster. The byelection was triggered by the sudden death in January of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. If you are just catching up, here’s the full report on the byelection results from my colleague Jessica Murray: Dominic Raab said it was “doubly reprehensible” that Russian forces had continued to shell a nuclear site after Ukrainian emergency services had looked to put a fire out at Europe’s largest power station. The deputy prime minister told Sky News the Russians had inflicted a bombardment on a “very sensitive, precarious and dangerous facility” in Zaporizhzhia. He said: The fact that the Russians kept on bombarding after there was the fire and the Ukrainian emergency rescue team were trying to get to that makes it doubly reprehensible. Raab said the UN security council meeting being called for by Boris Johnson was needed to “ramp up the pressure on these appalling tactics we are seeing from the Kremlin”. The international community needs to “come down hard on Putin” after Russian forces shelled a nuclear power station in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Dominic Raab. The deputy prime minister told Times Radio: It is clearly reckless, irresponsible and not only the fact they were shooting, bombarding that particular site, but when the Ukrainian emergency authorities were trying to put out the fire, the shelling continued. It must stop. We support the Ukrainians in dealing with the security situation there but also I think come down hard on Vladimir Putin. That’s why the prime minister has called for an emergency United Nations security council meeting in New York so the entire international community can address this, because of course it is a much wider threat, given the nuclear implications. It is an affront to the world at large. The UK is “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money, according to the deputy prime minister, as he sought to defend the government’s actions on targeting Russian oligarchs. Dominic Raab was asked during broadcast interviews why the European Union had sanctioned more individual Russian elites than Britain. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Raab said it was a “false distinction” to make, adding: The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing. Separately, he said: There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies. For example, we have sanctioned more Russian banks than the EU, including Sberbank, which is the biggest Russian bank. We’ve made it clear and introduced measures so that three million Russian companies cannot raise loans or get listed on the UK stock market. These measures – and each country has slightly different sanctions regimes – are all aimed at tightening the noose, if you like, and starving off the finance that is going into Putin’s war machine. Here’s more on why the UK seems so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs: Dominic Raab said he would “absolutely” support giving over seized Russian oligarch property in the UK to Ukrainian refugees. Asked on LBC whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian elites in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, the deputy prime minister said: “Yeah, if we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by housing secretary Michael Gove – Raab replied: Yes, absolutely. We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.

But prices have also been significantly affected by Russia’s recent decision to tighten gas supplies to Europe, which experts believe was driven by Vladimir Putin’s desire to move against Ukraine.</p> <p>Europe is dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, and despite the expansion of renewable energy over the past two decades, that dependency is increasing as countries shift to gas, away from dirtier coal. Germany is particularly vulnerable, as it has shut down nearly all of its nuclear power stations and aims to eliminate coal by 2030.</p> <p>A major new gas pipeline, Gazprom’s $11bn Nord Stream 2 from Russia across the Baltic to Germany, which would heat 26m German homes, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">the focus of Germany’s diplomatic relations with Russia</a> since it was announced in 2015. Construction on the 1,200km pipeline was completed last year, but no gas has yet flowed and its future is now in doubt as Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/germany-halts-nord-stream-2-approval-over-russian-recognition-of-ukraine-republics\">halted approval for the project</a> on Tuesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/02/russia-gaspipelines/giv-825cEXy5gy7o0Pm/\" data-alt=\"Russia's gas pipelines to Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/02/russia-gaspipelines/giv-825cEXy5gy7o0Pm/\">Russia's gas pipelines to Europe</a> <figcaption>Russia’s gas pipelines to Europe</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concerns that Russia is using its gas supplies as a weapon to achieve its political aims are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss\">well founded</a>. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted that Russia’s decision to drop gas supplies to Europe by a quarter came as it was heightening tension towards Ukraine. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/putin-ukraine-threats-russia-energy\">he told the Guardian</a>.</p> <h2>Is this really another war over fossil fuels?</h2> <p>No. Energy resources are not the focus of this threatened conflict. Vladimir Putin has a long history of territorial ambitions in former Soviet nations, which he made explicit this week, and of attempts to exert political control over Ukraine. Putin is said by supporters to be concerned over the possibility of Nato expansion, although many analysts say this is a pretext.</p> <p>So the Ukraine crisis is not a war over resources, but it has many implications for resource use. Russia is effectively weaponising its dominance over European gas supply for political ends. Reducing reliance on Russian gas is an urgent necessity for the EU to reach net zero emissions, and would also diminish Putin’s political leverage over the EU.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that in the longer term, as Europe weans itself off gas and pursues net zero emissions, the value of this political weapon will wane rapidly. Russia’s industries have never recovered from the fall of communism, and its economy is now based overwhelmingly on the export of fossil fuels, with much of the rest made up of energy-dependent mineral resources, such as iron, steel, aluminium and other metals, and some agriculture.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-economy-budget-idUSKBN2151VM\">Four in 10 roubles</a> accruing to Russia’s federal budget pre-pandemic came from oil and gas, which made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. Kremlin strategists are therefore keenly aware that in the longer term the global move to net zero threatens the whole basis of Russia’s economy and global influence.</p> <h2>Why is Europe so dependent on Russian gas?</h2> <p>Historically, much of Europe was heavily dependent on coal for power and heating. Renewable energy generation has more than doubled since 2004, and reached 22% of final energy production in 2020.</p> <p>However, at the same time the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/976248/nuclear-electricity-shares-european-union/\">share generated from nuclear power has fallen</a>, from about a third of the EU’s electricity in 1995 to about a quarter today. After the accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011, Germany’s then chancellor Angela Merkel announced an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nuclear-power-germany-renewable-energy\">“Energiewende”</a> – an energy shift – that would see all of the country’s reactors shut down.</p> <p>This has increased Germany’s need for gas, and similar moves away from coal and towards lower emissions in other countries – including the UK, which despite North Sea gas production is a net importer of gas – have heightened the dependency.</p> <p>The geopolitical implications of this dependency, as well as the climate impacts, are now unignorable. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, says: “It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its co-dependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake.

                    "bodyText": "What is the relationship between Russia’s threats to Ukraine and the gas price crisis? Gas prices are soaring globally, largely because of the resurgence of demand for fossil fuels after the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, depleted storage and the difficulty of ramping up supply after the disruptions of the past two years. But prices have also been significantly affected by Russia’s recent decision to tighten gas supplies to Europe, which experts believe was driven by Vladimir Putin’s desire to move against Ukraine. Europe is dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, and despite the expansion of renewable energy over the past two decades, that dependency is increasing as countries shift to gas, away from dirtier coal. Germany is particularly vulnerable, as it has shut down nearly all of its nuclear power stations and aims to eliminate coal by 2030. A major new gas pipeline, Gazprom’s $11bn Nord Stream 2 from Russia across the Baltic to Germany, which would heat 26m German homes, has been the focus of Germany’s diplomatic relations with Russia since it was announced in 2015. Construction on the 1,200km pipeline was completed last year, but no gas has yet flowed and its future is now in doubt as Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically halted approval for the project on Tuesday. Concerns that Russia is using its gas supplies as a weapon to achieve its political aims are well founded. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted that Russia’s decision to drop gas supplies to Europe by a quarter came as it was heightening tension towards Ukraine. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he told the Guardian. Is this really another war over fossil fuels? No. Energy resources are not the focus of this threatened conflict. Vladimir Putin has a long history of territorial ambitions in former Soviet nations, which he made explicit this week, and of attempts to exert political control over Ukraine. Putin is said by supporters to be concerned over the possibility of Nato expansion, although many analysts say this is a pretext. So the Ukraine crisis is not a war over resources, but it has many implications for resource use. Russia is effectively weaponising its dominance over European gas supply for political ends. Reducing reliance on Russian gas is an urgent necessity for the EU to reach net zero emissions, and would also diminish Putin’s political leverage over the EU. It is also worth noting that in the longer term, as Europe weans itself off gas and pursues net zero emissions, the value of this political weapon will wane rapidly. Russia’s industries have never recovered from the fall of communism, and its economy is now based overwhelmingly on the export of fossil fuels, with much of the rest made up of energy-dependent mineral resources, such as iron, steel, aluminium and other metals, and some agriculture. Four in 10 roubles accruing to Russia’s federal budget pre-pandemic came from oil and gas, which made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. Kremlin strategists are therefore keenly aware that in the longer term the global move to net zero threatens the whole basis of Russia’s economy and global influence. Why is Europe so dependent on Russian gas? Historically, much of Europe was heavily dependent on coal for power and heating. Renewable energy generation has more than doubled since 2004, and reached 22% of final energy production in 2020. However, at the same time the share generated from nuclear power has fallen, from about a third of the EU’s electricity in 1995 to about a quarter today. After the accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011, Germany’s then chancellor Angela Merkel announced an “Energiewende” – an energy shift – that would see all of the country’s reactors shut down. This has increased Germany’s need for gas, and similar moves away from coal and towards lower emissions in other countries – including the UK, which despite North Sea gas production is a net importer of gas – have heightened the dependency. The geopolitical implications of this dependency, as well as the climate impacts, are now unignorable. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, says: “It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its co-dependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake. Reducing Russian gas reliance is a huge climate and moral imperative that Europe must prioritise.” Will Russia turn off gas supplies to Europe if the EU and the UK impose sanctions? That would be a momentous move from Russia. Any further reductions of Russian gas supply to Europe would have severe consequences, for Europe but also for Russia itself. Birol said earlier this month, before sanctions were imposed: “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted.” He added: “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia.” What impact will Russia’s actions in Ukraine have on climate diplomacy? Russia was almost invisible at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, after a surprising public commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. But the Kremlin has left the details of the goal vague and shown little sign of updating Russia’s emissions commitments for 2030, which are key to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C. This is a crucial year for climate diplomacy, as the pledges from all countries in Glasgow are still inadequate for the 1.5C goal, and the UK Cop26 presidency is hoping for major progress before the next UN climate meeting in Egypt this November. Russia’s stance on Ukraine will certainly have an impact on those discussions, not least as any conflict will focus attention on the move from fossil fuels. It is also notable that Russia’s oil and gas operations are among the worst in the world for the climate. Data released this week by the IEA shows that emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and the major component of natural gas, are 70% higher than countries had claimed. Russia makes little or no attempt to capture methane from its oil and gas drilling, and to stop its pipelines leaking, so there are huge opportunities. If Putin were serious about tackling the climate crisis, Russia could provide an invaluable service to the rest of the world by plugging these leaks – reducing methane globally by a third by 2030 could reduce temperatures by 0.2C – and at current gas prices this could be done at no net cost and could even be profitable. Should the UK be fracking more, or producing more from the North Sea, to reduce dependency on Russian gas? No. Attempts to frack in the UK started more than a decade ago, but went nowhere, in part because of protests but also because the economics of industrial fracking in a densely populated country make it impractical.

If they are successful, they might slow down the transition to clean domestic energy.” Far more good could be done in the shorter term by insulating homes and ramping up renewable energy generation. What is the answer to the crisis? Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US and an adviser to the UN secretary-general on the climate, says: “The west needs to meet Putin’s flagrant breach of international law with tough sanctions to force a change in calculus in Moscow.

Crucially, the impending crisis could lead energy companies to cut their output, one of the country’s biggest gas companies has said. Businesses located along the Rhine or dependent on it to transport or receive goods are warning that they have been forced to scale back activities and reduce loads drastically – and are now on the verge of having to close some production if cargo ships are no longer able to access the river. The Rhine, which runs about 760 miles from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea, is the second largest river in central and western Europe after the Danube. The majority of nearly 200 million tons of cargo shipped on German rivers – from coal to car parts, food to chemicals – is transported on the Rhine.

Cologne’s Waterway and Shipping Authority has said the “unusually low levels” for this time of year meansbarges have had to reduce their cargo “in order to be able to navigate the river”. This increases prices and reduces the speed with which goods can be transported. Of major concern, as Germany braces itself for a winter of energy rationing due to an 80% reduction in gas flows from Russia, is the knock-on effect the depletion in river traffic could have on energy output. Uniper, Germany’s biggest distributor of Russian gas, which already recently needed a multi-billion euro bailout by the German government to stop it collapsing, has cautioned of potentially “irregular performance” for the next month at Staudinger-5, its coal-fired, 510-megawatt power plant east of Frankfurt – a major tributary of the Rhine – due to interruptions to coal delivery supplies along the river. As demand for coal has increased, Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has decided to recommission coal-fired power plants, which had previously been mothballed but are now seen as a temporary solution to help Germany wean itself off Russian gas. Industry bosses in Germany, seeking to stave off recession amid high energy prices and rampant inflation, are now paying almost as much attention to daily river levels as they are to the amount of gas flowing from Russia (20%, or 33 million cubic metres). Of more immediate concern are the levels of gas stored at almost two dozen facilities around the country, standing on Thursday at 70.39%. Low water levels usually occur much later in the year, but reflect the drought conditions affecting large parts of Europe. This week, the French energy supplier EDF said it was temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the rivers Rhône and Garonne as heatwaves restricted its ability to use river water to cool the plants. Meanwhile, in the UK the source of the River Thames was reported on Thursday to have dried up for the first time since records began due to a lack of rainfall. To take a snapshot of the situation in Germany, in Cologne, the largest city on the Rhine, areas of the river have been reduced to a mere trickle.

According to Christian Lorenz, of Ports and Freight Traffic Cologne, a lot of freight traffic had already reduced its cargo by half in order to be light enough to travel safely. “Typically a cargo ship carrying salt from Heilbronn would be carrying 2,100 tons on board, but on Monday this had to be reduced to just 900 tons due to the river level,” he told German media. To make up for the reduced capacity, companies are facing the more expensive options of either using more ships or reloading on to lorries or goods trains – but both are currently in short supply. Ships, in particular, are in demand in the Black Sea to bring grain supplies from Ukraine, now possible for the first time in months. Plans are under way for the construction of low-lying barges and ships as well as for the deepening of the Rhine, and better forecasting of water levels as a result of the 2018 crisis, but these measures are slow in being realised. The timing of the Rhine’s shrinking could hardly be worse from an economic perspective. Many of the businesses dependent on it have been racing to fix supply chains massively interrupted by the pandemic and urgently trying to replenish their stocks. Environmentalists are also raising the alarm as rising temperatures lead to a high concentration of pollutants which can be damaging to the flora, fauna and fish. Swimmers have also been warned to keep away from the river because a reduction in water levels can lead to narrower channels and stronger currents.",

It is also true, as you say, that far-right parties have not gained the significance in the UK that they have elsewhere. The first-past-the-post voting system effectively excludes the representation of small, far-right parties in parliament. More effective, in the UK, is entryism into an existing party.</p> <p>In recent years, the Conservative party has become the vehicle for far-right policies and politicians who promote those policies, not least: cultural intolerance; leaving the EU; the linking of racist anti-immigration politics and Europhobia; promoting a “hostile environment” for asylum seekers and attempting to deport legal asylum seekers to Rwanda; the marginalising of experts (elites); promoting nationalism with those union flags that now drape every minister’s office; attacking democracy by illegally proroguing parliament and denigrating human rights lawyers as “lefties” and “do-gooders” and restricting freedoms to protest. The new secretary of state for health and social care has been less than supportive of abortion rights. Today’s Conservative party has adopted policies and taken positions not that dissimilar to those in Sweden, Orbán’s Hungary, Duda’s Poland and Erdoğan’s Turkey.<br><strong>Dr Robin Richmond</strong><br>Bromyard, Herefordshire<br></p> <p>Thank you for Drude Dahlerup’s article on Sweden (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/18/swedens-mainstream-parties-cravenly-opened-the-door-to-anti-immigrant-populists\" title=\"\">Sweden’s mainstream parties cravenly opened the door to anti-immigrant populists</a>”, Comment). The previous Social Democrat-Green party-Left party coalition government, which in one form or another has governed for much of the last 60 years, lost the recent election as over the past decade its policies have been disastrous in regard to education, immigration, finance, healthcare, defence and the environment. One example is that Sweden’s death rate from Covid was double that of other Scandinavian nations. Another is that Sweden let its top-class nuclear power capabilities wither without any viable, nationally controlled alternative(s) in place. The election gave Swedes the choice between “bad” and “maybe not as bad”. I predict there will be a new election before the end of 2023.<br><strong>James Van Alstine</strong><br>Stockholm<br></p> <h2>The Queen’s final gift?</h2> <p>Like Catherine Bennett, I had already enjoyed Boris Johnson’s absence last week and his probable frustration at being absent from this historic time (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/tired-of-pomp-at-least-boris-johnson-not-there-to-upstage-royals\" title=\"\">Tiring of all the pomp? Cheer up – at least Boris Johnson is not there to upstage the royals</a>”, Comment). I found particular pleasure in imagining that the late Queen may have decided to wait for the end of the interminable Conservative leadership election and for Johnson’s formal resignation. I like to think of this as a final dutiful gift to the people of Britain.</p> <p>Thank you, Ma’am.<br><strong>Kate Blok</strong><br>Brighton<br></p> <h2>In metric we trust</h2> <p>Jon Ungoed-Thomas summarises well the government’s “consultation” on weights and measures: a deeply flawed questionnaire over an unnecessary, wasteful and potentially damaging proposal (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/18/metric-system-imperial-measures-consultation-brexit\" title=\"\">Want to axe the metric system? Say yes here</a>”, News).</p> <p>Currently, customers have a legal right to be informed of the quantity and price of any product on supermarket shelves in metric units, allowing comparisons to be made. The effect of the proposal is to take away this right. Not more choice, less. Metric units have been the primary units taught in British schools since 1974; pounds/ounces are alien to most young people.</p> <p>You are right: the history of metrication in the UK dates from Victorian times. A firm decision to metricate was made in 1965, long before EEC/EU entry.</p> <p>Pretending that metric units were imposed by the EU is wrong. It is equally wrong to believe that something is desirable merely because Brexit makes it possible. Metric units are used in science, medicine, building, engineering and sport. British imperial units are in common use nowhere else in the world, not even the USA or the Commonwealth. They are complex and poorly understood. Dual units cause confusion and sometimes danger.</p> <p>The consultation outcome may be greeted by the government as giving it the answer it wanted. It is not, however, valid and it deserves to be thrown forcefully in the bin.<br><strong>Dr Peter Burke</strong>, chair, UK Metric Association, London N11<br></p> <h2>Beware tarantula tirades</h2> <p>Andrew Rawnsley reminds us that “the author of the notorious ‘black spider’ memos to ministers has sought to pre-empt anxieties about how he will conduct himself” (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/18/liz-truss-cant-speak-for-national-mood-doesnt-really-understnd-it\" title=\"\">Liz Truss can’t speak for the national mood because she really doesn’t understand it</a>”, Comment). But we have also heard about his exasperation at a leaking fountain pen (“I can’t bear this bloody thing. Every stinking time…”). There are lots of opportunities now, as Charles moves from prince to king, for tiny black spidery missives to become overwhelming tarantula tirades. I don’t see him being restrained by leaky pens.<br><strong>Julia Edwards</strong><br>Winchester<br></p> <h2>Physician, heal thyself</h2> <p>Thank you to Sian Harding for raising awareness of sex inequality in cardiac health outcomes (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/18/why-gender-is-at-the-heart-of-the-matter-for-cardiac-illness\" title=\"\">Heart disease: why gender is a matter of life or death</a>”, the New Review). However, I was concerned by the implication that this inequality is the responsibility of the patients rather than the medical personnel. In future, perhaps, her phrasing could be adjusted from “What is it about female patients that makes the male doctors treat them differently?” to “What is it about male doctors that makes them treat female patients differently?”.</p> <p>Also worth noting is that our behaviour does not affect how “male” or “female” we appear, but how “masculine” or “feminine”. The distinction is clear and vital: male and female refer to biological sex; masculine and feminine to the socially constructed expectations associated with our sex, referred to as gender. Women experience different typical heart attack symptoms than men due to their sex, as described in Dr Alyson McGregor’s book <em>Sex Matters</em>. That they are stereotyped as hysterical when they seek help is due to gender.<br><strong>Amy Holland</strong><br>London, SE11<br></p> <h2>What Picasso can teach Putin</h2> <p>Like the visitor photographed in Kenan Malik’s article on <em>Guernica</em>, (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/18/web-has-expanded-the-reach-of-art-but-nothing-beats-standing-in-front-of-a-picasso\" title=\"\">The web has expanded the reach of art but nothing beats standing in front of a Picasso</a>”, Comment), I too stood in front of Picasso’s masterpiece in the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid a few days ago. And, like Malik more than 30 years ago, “I was overcome by a sense of dislocation and horror”. A feeling that was magnified and contemporised when the middle-aged American woman standing next to me turned and said: “Putin should see this.”<br><strong>Mick Beeby</strong><br>Westbury on Trym, Bristol<br></p> <p>• The first letter on this page was amended on 25 September 2022.

                    "bodyText": "That “Sweden shows that nowhere in Europe is immune to the rise of the far right” is probably true (Editorial). It is also true, as you say, that far-right parties have not gained the significance in the UK that they have elsewhere. The first-past-the-post voting system effectively excludes the representation of small, far-right parties in parliament. More effective, in the UK, is entryism into an existing party. In recent years, the Conservative party has become the vehicle for far-right policies and politicians who promote those policies, not least: cultural intolerance; leaving the EU; the linking of racist anti-immigration politics and Europhobia; promoting a “hostile environment” for asylum seekers and attempting to deport legal asylum seekers to Rwanda; the marginalising of experts (elites); promoting nationalism with those union flags that now drape every minister’s office; attacking democracy by illegally proroguing parliament and denigrating human rights lawyers as “lefties” and “do-gooders” and restricting freedoms to protest. The new secretary of state for health and social care has been less than supportive of abortion rights. Today’s Conservative party has adopted policies and taken positions not that dissimilar to those in Sweden, Orbán’s Hungary, Duda’s Poland and Erdoğan’s Turkey. Dr Robin Richmond Bromyard, Herefordshire Thank you for Drude Dahlerup’s article on Sweden (“Sweden’s mainstream parties cravenly opened the door to anti-immigrant populists”, Comment). The previous Social Democrat-Green party-Left party coalition government, which in one form or another has governed for much of the last 60 years, lost the recent election as over the past decade its policies have been disastrous in regard to education, immigration, finance, healthcare, defence and the environment. One example is that Sweden’s death rate from Covid was double that of other Scandinavian nations. Another is that Sweden let its top-class nuclear power capabilities wither without any viable, nationally controlled alternative(s) in place. The election gave Swedes the choice between “bad” and “maybe not as bad”. I predict there will be a new election before the end of 2023. James Van Alstine Stockholm The Queen’s final gift? Like Catherine Bennett, I had already enjoyed Boris Johnson’s absence last week and his probable frustration at being absent from this historic time (“Tiring of all the pomp? Cheer up – at least Boris Johnson is not there to upstage the royals”, Comment). I found particular pleasure in imagining that the late Queen may have decided to wait for the end of the interminable Conservative leadership election and for Johnson’s formal resignation. I like to think of this as a final dutiful gift to the people of Britain. Thank you, Ma’am. Kate Blok Brighton In metric we trust Jon Ungoed-Thomas summarises well the government’s “consultation” on weights and measures: a deeply flawed questionnaire over an unnecessary, wasteful and potentially damaging proposal (“Want to axe the metric system? Say yes here”, News). Currently, customers have a legal right to be informed of the quantity and price of any product on supermarket shelves in metric units, allowing comparisons to be made. The effect of the proposal is to take away this right. Not more choice, less. Metric units have been the primary units taught in British schools since 1974; pounds/ounces are alien to most young people. You are right: the history of metrication in the UK dates from Victorian times. A firm decision to metricate was made in 1965, long before EEC/EU entry. Pretending that metric units were imposed by the EU is wrong. It is equally wrong to believe that something is desirable merely because Brexit makes it possible. Metric units are used in science, medicine, building, engineering and sport. British imperial units are in common use nowhere else in the world, not even the USA or the Commonwealth. They are complex and poorly understood. Dual units cause confusion and sometimes danger. The consultation outcome may be greeted by the government as giving it the answer it wanted. It is not, however, valid and it deserves to be thrown forcefully in the bin. Dr Peter Burke, chair, UK Metric Association, London N11 Beware tarantula tirades Andrew Rawnsley reminds us that “the author of the notorious ‘black spider’ memos to ministers has sought to pre-empt anxieties about how he will conduct himself” (“Liz Truss can’t speak for the national mood because she really doesn’t understand it”, Comment). But we have also heard about his exasperation at a leaking fountain pen (“I can’t bear this bloody thing. Every stinking time…”). There are lots of opportunities now, as Charles moves from prince to king, for tiny black spidery missives to become overwhelming tarantula tirades. I don’t see him being restrained by leaky pens. Julia Edwards Winchester Physician, heal thyself Thank you to Sian Harding for raising awareness of sex inequality in cardiac health outcomes (“Heart disease: why gender is a matter of life or death”, the New Review). However, I was concerned by the implication that this inequality is the responsibility of the patients rather than the medical personnel. In future, perhaps, her phrasing could be adjusted from “What is it about female patients that makes the male doctors treat them differently?” to “What is it about male doctors that makes them treat female patients differently?”. Also worth noting is that our behaviour does not affect how “male” or “female” we appear, but how “masculine” or “feminine”. The distinction is clear and vital: male and female refer to biological sex; masculine and feminine to the socially constructed expectations associated with our sex, referred to as gender. Women experience different typical heart attack symptoms than men due to their sex, as described in Dr Alyson McGregor’s book Sex Matters. That they are stereotyped as hysterical when they seek help is due to gender. Amy Holland London, SE11 What Picasso can teach Putin Like the visitor photographed in Kenan Malik’s article on Guernica, (“The web has expanded the reach of art but nothing beats standing in front of a Picasso”, Comment), I too stood in front of Picasso’s masterpiece in the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid a few days ago. And, like Malik more than 30 years ago, “I was overcome by a sense of dislocation and horror”. A feeling that was magnified and contemporised when the middle-aged American woman standing next to me turned and said: “Putin should see this.” Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol • The first letter on this page was amended on 25 September 2022. An earlier version had transposed the presidents of two countries in referring to “Duda’s Hungary” and “Orbán’s Poland”.",

Saifuddin told reporters he communicated Malaysia’s ongoing concern about the security deal between Australia, the UK and the US during a “very candid” discussion with Wong on her first visit to the Malaysian capital as Australia’s foreign minister. Regional objections to Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines surfaced almost immediately after Aukus was unveiled by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison. Saifuddin and Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, pointed to the risk of a regional arms race at a time of increasing tensions in the East and South China Seas. Last November, the Morrison government deployed then foreign minister Marise Payne to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia in an effort to smooth over tensions. Since being sworn in just over a month ago, Wong has embarked on a diplomatic offensive in the region to reset relationships disturbed by Aukus and to counter increasingly assertive regional outreach by China in the Pacific. Asked on Tuesday whether or not his negative view of Aukus had ameliorated since the unveiling of the pact last September, Malaysia’s foreign minister said: “Malaysia highly values regional peace and security of the Asean region.” “We want to maintain the South China Sea in particular and the region as a whole as a region of peace, of commerce, of prosperity. “We had a very candid discussion on Aukus just now and I thank [Australia’s] foreign minister for explaining the government’s position.

                    "bodyText": "The mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong have expressed unease at the Morrison government naming their cities as a potential base for nuclear-powered submarines, with one describing the Aukus plans as a “fantasy”. Questions have also been raised about the government’s process for shortlisting Newcastle, Port Kembla in Wollongong and Brisbane for a new east coast base, given that a previous Defence review had not backed them as most-preferred sites. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick, a former submariner, said Scott Morrison’s announcement on Monday was “thick with political fog” with an election looming, noting the final site would not be selected until 2023. Patrick said: “Why pork barrel in one electorate when you can – for the same price – pork barrel in three?” Morrison said the government had “provisioned more than $10bn to meet the facilities and infrastructure requirements” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins-class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. He said Defence had looked at 19 potential sites and narrowed them down to the three preferred locations. Defence would now discuss the plans further with state and local governments and “begin negotiations on what will be an enormous undertaking”. The moves come amid continuing uncertainty about when the first of the nuclear-powered submarines will be operating. Morrison originally estimated it would be by about 2040 but the government now insists it may be sooner. The new base – which the Coalition wants to build in either Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla – would “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, Morrison said in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. However, the mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong both said they were not consulted about the decision. With both cities historically home to anti-war movements they expected considerable community opposition. Both cities have passed official resolutions to make them nuclear-free zones. There is also believed to be opposition to nuclear power, particularly where it is used to propel a weapon of war – although spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights reactor have passed through Port Kembla on their way for processing in France. Wollongong’s lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, an independent, said he was waiting for more detail about the proposal before he would consult the local community. “It’s not only nuclear power and nuclear-powered submarines, but it’s the location of a strategic defence asset and that would make anyone who gets this particular facility a target,” Bradbery said. “International tensions now are playing on a lot of people’s minds and there would be concerns about our city as a location for nuclear-powered submarines.” Bradbery said Wollongong city council had previously worked with Regional Development Australia to make a submission to the federal government to relocate naval activities from Garden Island in Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla, but this was for conventional submarines only. “It just disappeared into the ether at the time,” Bradbery said. “Many suggested it was pie in the sky as the navy wasn’t keen on relocating from Garden Island.” Newcastle’s Labor lord mayor, Nuatali Nelmes, said the city had no intention of giving up its nuclear-free status over a “fantasy”. “The whole deal is a fantasy,” Nelmes said. “This announcement, the Aukus decision and the absolutely hopeless way they have handled this submarine contract – we are not getting lumped with their mess. “It is also typical of the federal government to have unilateral decision making where cities like Newcastle, which have been for many decades, a nuclear-free zone, would even be considered.” But the Liberal premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, welcomed the inclusion of Port Kembla and Newcastle on the federal government’s shortlist, saying the world faced “very uncertain times”. “Defence protection for our country is paramount and we have worked very closely with the federal government to identify these sites for our state,” Perrottet told the Nine Network. A spokesperson for the Queensland Labor government said it was “yet to receive any detailed information from the commonwealth”. Study found Port Kembla ‘impractical’ A 2011 Defence report ranked potential options for a new east coast home port for submarines. The top three options were in Sydney Harbour, followed by two options in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. “Newcastle has its strengths, but the slight edge that it has with respect to positive people factors is compromised by its isolation from any other naval infrastructure, its susceptibility to flooding, and its sometimes difficult harbour entrance,” the future submarine basing study said. Newcastle Port was sixth on the list and the Port of Brisbane was eighth. The report included the caveat that detailed costing and environmental impact analysis “may generate a different outcome”. It placed a priority on the proximity to fleet assets in Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The same 2011 Defence study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it was previously found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. Patrick, a senator who obtained the 2011 report under freedom of information laws, said it had been “a pure study” completed “without political considerations”. Although that study was focused on a new base for conventionally powered submarines, Patrick said he believed the presence of the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney and associated specialists would only strengthen the case for Sydney. Patrick accused Morrison of dangling a “carrot” for three electorates prior to the election due in May. “In some sense, it’s a toxic carrot because it will divide communities, but he’s particularly good at that,” Patrick said. In a statement, Morrison said an east coast submarine base “would enhance Australia’s strategic deterrent capability in the Pacific Ocean”. The locations were “selected on submarine basing criteria, which included access to exercise operating areas, proximity to industrial infrastructure, and significant population centres to support personnel and recruitment”. Labor demanded a “proper briefing” on the base plans. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, who has supported the Aukus partnership, said the government had made “an announcement about there being an announcement down the track”. “You can’t actually defend the country with a media release,” Albanese said. Comment was also sought from Defence, Regional Development Australia and Brisbane city council.",

But even so, many African and Gulf states are refusing to take sides.</p> \n  <p>In March, in the immediate wake of the invasion, 141 countries opposed Russia’s action, 35 abstained and five supported Russia.</p> \n  <p>The diplomats said Russia had been “trying very hard in Africa to frame this as a west versus the rest conflict”, adding “lots of things play into these votes that are not necessarily the question in hand”.</p> \n  <p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, last week visited the foreign ministers of Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast on his first African tour since the Russian offensive. He is also trying to build what Ukraine admits has been previously inadequate contacts in India and China.</p> \n  <p>A western diplomat said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To any straight-thinking person this is a slam dunk, but countries relationships with each other and their interdependencies are complex and very messy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But western diplomats said an “important shift” was under way amongst some powerful non-aligned countries that had shown themselves “increasingly uncomfortable” with Putin. The diplomats pointed to a Chinese official statement reaffirming the importance of national sovereignty, and the urging by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for an end to the fighting.</p> \n  <p>India, the diplomat pointed out, is dependent on Russia for oil and military equipment:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They think twice about whether they can afford to trim their principles or more probably rely on countries like the UK to defend them and to allow them to operate in a slightly grey area.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The sources added that they “could not see China cutting Russia adrift since it would fear that Russia might ultimately be drawn into the western orbit”. But they claim the repeated requirement of Russia to go in front of the UN General Assembly to explain why it is using its veto to then to be defeated humiliatingly is having the cumulative effect of making Russia feel diplomatically isolated. “It is a case of reducing the space for authoritarian dictators”, the source said.</p> \n  <p>Russia, it was pointed out, has in recent months been thrown off the UN Human Rights Council board for UN women, and the board for Unicef, and efforts are under way to squeeze them off the UN Economic and Social Committee.</p> \n  <p>Ukraine has been calling for Russia to be declared a terrorist state, a move that could have an impact on Russia’s seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council, although that is extremely unlikely under the existing rules.</p> \n  <p>The US is likely to say if about 100 member states in the General Assembly vote to support the EU resolution that compares favourably with the vote held in 2014 at the time of the annexation of Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>• This post was amended on 18 October 2022. An earlier version said that Russia being declared a terrorist state would see it “lose its seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council”. However, there is nothing in the UN charter that explicitly states this, and the wording has been amended accordingly.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-10-19T11:38:36.896Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6345813a8f085d1d9ceb9bba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-10-11T14:44:15.904Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Japan’s prime minister, <strong>Fumio Kishida</strong>, has said Russia’s possible use of nuclear weapons is highly unpredictable.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to reporters after the virtual G7 meeting on Russia’s invasion fo Ukraine, Kishida said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The situation does not at all allow any prediction.

But there are doubts over whether Russia has the stocks of missiles to maintain such an approach, as Dan Sabbagh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/kremlin-decision-to-target-ukraines-cities-was-political-not-tactical\">notes in this analysis</a>.</p> \n  <p>The chief of GCHQ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/gchq-head-putin-making-strategic-errors-ukraine-russia\">will say in a rare speech today</a> that Russian forces are exhausted and their supplies of munitions are running out. “These attacks don’t make a lot of sense for the military picture on the ground,” Peter said. “Shooting up cities doesn’t advance your troops. What I think would worry Ukraine more is some change on the frontlines.”</p> \n  <p>In that context, there may be more concern over the news yesterday that Russian forces will be allowed to return to Belarus, potentially stretching Ukrainian forces further on the northern border.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, as G7 leaders meet today, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> in attendance, western leaders appear to have acknowledged the renewed urgency of the case for additional help: Germany said it would begin to deliver four long-awaited advanced air defence systems in the next few days, while Joe Biden also pledged the provision of advanced air defence systems in a call with Ukraine’s president yesterday.</p> \n  <p>“Those systems aren’t infallible,” Peter said. “But you cannot have a conversation with anyone in this country, whether they’re a farmer in Kherson or a senior official, where they don’t come up.”</p> \n  <p>Behind all of this is an unthinkable threat: nuclear attack. “Everybody here knows it’s a shoe that hasn’t dropped, and it overshadows life to some degree,” Peter said. “But one of the features of the last few days is that if something like what happened to the Kerch bridge doesn’t prompt that, when it was so humiliating for Putin, we may have a long way to go to get there.”</p> \n  <p><strong>You can read it in full here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/11/tuesday-briefing-after-russia-retaliates-what-might-happen-next\">Tuesday briefing – After Russia retaliates, what might happen next?</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/11/tuesday-briefing-after-russia-retaliates-what-might-happen-next\">Tuesday briefing: After Russia retaliates, what might happen next?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-10-11T08:01:52.380Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-634512838f083d981ab0e54f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-10-11T06:56:16.747Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Ukrainian MP <strong>Volodymyr Ariev</strong> has told Sky News in the UK that he believed Vladimir Putin launched the wave of attacks so he could look like a strong leader at the G20 summit in Bali, rather than a weak one who had been losing ground in Ukraine. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand that it was planned in advance. Putin would like to present it like a response to the explosion on the Crimea bridge, but it hasn’t been proven who was behind that attack. But for Putin it makes no sense to find a truthful reason for escalation in Ukraine.</p> \n   <p>The reason for it, for me, is pretty understandable. In one month, Putin is going to the meeting of G20 countries in Indonesia. So he would like to present himself not a weak leader, after defeats of the Russian army on conventional battlegrounds. He would like to speak to the world from a position of strength.</p> \n   <p>So that’s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/russia-appoints-notorious-general-sergei-surovikin-ukraine\">he changed the commander of operations</a> against Ukraine, and his first day was an airstrike to scare Ukraine.

For now, some key links and updates from the day: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The UN and some Nato countries warned that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack, in which cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets, as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. Roughly 30% of the Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. A deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia’s military strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites around Ukraine, the AP reports. In a speech to Unesco, the Ukrainian president urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was nominating the Black Sea city of Odesa to be inscribed on the agency’s World Heritage list, AP reported. He also said that 540 “objects of cultural heritage, cultural institutions and religious buildings” have been destroyed or damaged since the start of Russia’s invasion in February. He added: Why are representatives of Russia still among you? What are they doing at Unesco?” As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines, Reuters reports: Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainians had voluntarily cut their electricity consumption by an average of 10% on Monday after Russia’s attacks, and urged them to limit use between 5pm and 11pm local time on Tuesday. “We are united and will stand firm,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Please don’t turn on energy-intensive appliances: electric stoves, electric kettles, power tools, heaters and air conditioners, ovens and irons, microwave ovens, coffee makers, washing machines and dishwashers.” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, has told CNN that Russian missiles have hit roughly 30% of the country’s energy infrastructure since Monday. Halushchenko said: We send this message to our partners: we need to protect the sky. Russians they are not playing on some games on international laws. They don’t care about any kind of international agreements or conventions.” He also told CNN that this was the first time since the start of war that Russia had “dramatically targeted” Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and that Ukraine was working to reconnect quickly from other sources. Russia’s defence ministry earlier confirmed that its troops were continuing long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s military and energy infrastructure. Reports suggested that six people were injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region. Halushchenko’s comments come after some Nato countries and the UN have warned that Russia may be committing a war crime with its ongoing attack on civilian targets. Ukrainians in Prague rallied this evening to protest Russian missile strikes, the AP reports: The protesters held blue-and-yellow crosses with the names of the cities hit by the Russian missiles. “Ukraine needs air defenses to be able to prevent the massacres of the civilian population and destruction of our cities,” Anastasiia Sihnaievska told the crowd. “We are protecting our right to live,” said Sihnaievska, who fled her town of Zhytomyr because of the Russian invasion. People chanted “Russia’s terrorist!” and “More weapons for Ukraine!” They unveiled a giant Ukrainian flag and displayed banners that read “Air defense systems for Ukraine,” “We will not forget, We will not forgive,” and “Stop bombing Ukraine.” Some photos below from the demonstration, which as the AP noted, came the same day that the presidents of Czechia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Montenegro said the missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians “constitute war crimes under international law”. The US will be watching which nations side with Russia at Wednesday’s General Assembly vote on the resolution condemning Russian annexations in eastern Ukraine, the US ambassador to the UN said today, CNN reports. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said there were roughly 70 co-sponsors of the resolution and that the vote was geared toward “defending the UN” and its charter, the network reported. She said she couldn’t predict how China, India or other nations would vote. Earlier in the week, Russia unsuccessfully pushed for a secret ballot for the vote. Forensic workers in protective gear pulled several bodies wrapped in black plastic from a mass grave in Ukraine’s liberated city of Lyman today as authorities work to assess the death toll and damage from more than four months of Russian occupation, the Associated Press reports. An AP reporter said that 10 body bags lay beside a roughly 100ft (30-metre) trench, and that authorities said 32 bodies had been exhumed so far in the city, which is in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The head of the Donetsk region’s military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the victims in the mass grave were Ukrainian soldiers, and that there were also 22 civilians buried in individual graves at the site, located by a cemetery on the outskirts of Lyman. This was the second burial site uncovered in Lyman so far. More background from the AP: As Ukrainian authorities entered the city, they found that many civilian residents had been killed by shelling. Others, mostly older people, had died during the Russian occupation because of a lack of food and medicine, Mark Tkachenko, communications inspector for the Kramatorsk district police of the Donetsk region, told the AP. The destruction in Lyman, a key rail and transit hub, is so widespread that large portions of the city have been completely destroyed. Ukrainian authorities are now working to restore basic infrastructure and investigate how civilians lived and died during the Russian occupation. Forensic investigators on Tuesday lifted a black plastic bag from the trench and unzipped it to reveal a decomposed body in a bloody uniform of the Ukrainian armed forces. The remains were briefly inspected by investigators, then placed in another body bag and set among several others beside the trench. Authorities said children have been found among the dead, and that most victims appeared to have died as the result of the heavy shelling that besieged the city for months. Authorities said the investigation was ongoing and that it was too soon to say whether the victims showed signs of execution or torture, the AP also reported. More from the AP reporter on the ground: It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with President Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation”. Zelenskiy also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia and to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country. President Zelenskiy has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, said the mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. On Monday, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. Nato is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg said. He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. Çavuşoğlu urged “a viable ceasefire and a just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, according to the head of the British spy agency GCHQ. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The US is speeding up the shipment of two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine, the White House said. President Joe Biden had pledged to support Kyiv’s air defences in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday, following a wave of devastating Russian missile attacks on cities across Ukraine. The US has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight NASAMS air defences so far, with two expected to be delivered soon and six more sent over a longer time frame. Speaking to reporters, the White House’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby said: We think that we’re on track to get those first two over there in the very near future. We are certainly interested in expediting the delivery of NASAMS to Ukraine as soon as we can. A British businessman has been arrested on US charges of conspiring to violate sanctions placed on the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, according to prosecutors. Graham Bonham-Carter was arrested in the UK, and New York federal prosecutors will be seeking his extradition, Reuters reports. Bonham-Carter was also charged with wire fraud for funding US properties purchased by Deripaska and efforts to expatriate Deripaska’s artwork in the US. There was scant attempt to sugarcoat the assessment. With the trams stilled, lights going down across the city and the mobile network intermittent, arguably there was little point in doing otherwise. “We have to brace ourselves for hard times,” said Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, as he addressed local and international journalists in a building off the western Ukrainian city’s cobbled Rynov Square. Winter was coming and with it “perhaps the worst-ever period for our country”, the mayor said. For all that the missiles would continue to rain down it was the cold that the Russians believed could break the Ukrainian spirit. Stock up on fire wood, buy in heaters, insulate where you can, Sadovyi counselled. It was time for Ukrainians to resort to the “old-time methods”. We are in for hard weeks and months ahead. Four [electricity] substations in the region have been put out of operation and to bring them back into operation they need transformers that are not available. It is hard right now to predict what will happen tomorrow. We will do all we can to keep the medical facilities operating. Lviv, just 50 miles from the Polish border, has at times felt somewhat removed from Vladimir Putin’s war. Direct attacks have been few and far between. Following the initial shock over the launch of the Russian president’s “special military operation”, the bars and restaurants had swiftly rediscovered the liveliness that one would expect of an old university town. When air raid sirens would go off to warn that Russian missiles had been launched, destination unknown, the danger could be barely acknowledged at times. Spring gave way to a relatively care-free summer. The attacks of Monday and Tuesday changed all that. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. Russia has added the US tech giant Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisations, Russian news agencies have reported. Facebook and Instagram were both banned in Russia in March for “carrying out extremist activities” and the company was accused of tolerating “Russophobia”. Meta had announced back then that the platforms would allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians. A Moscow court in June rejected an appeal by Meta, whose lawyer said it was not carrying out extremist activity. The company has now been added to a list of “terrorists and extremists” by Russia’s financial monitoring agency, Rosfinmonitoring. The list concerns “organisations and individuals with regard to which there is information about their involvement in extremist activities or terrorism”. The ban does not apply to WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border, as Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with a new wave of missile strikes on Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s comments came amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Warning that the Russian president “still has room for further escalation”, Zelenskiy added that the prompt supply of more air defence systems would accelerate the end of the war. “When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work,” Zelenskiy said in a video-streamed address. Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday that Ukraine had received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system and the White House National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, said the US was working to expedite the shipment of sophisticated Nasams air defences capable of engaging Russian cruise missiles that was first announced in August. While Zelenskiy had been expected to press for additional air defence systems to counter the Russian missile threat, and renewed his call for more sanctions against Moscow, his request for international monitoring of Ukraine’s border with Belarus comes amid mounting fears that Minsk is being drawn ever further into the Kremlin’s war. Read the full story here: Elon Musk has denied a report that he spoke with Vladimir Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. The Tesla CEO was asked about the report, which was first written about by Ian Bremmer to his subscribers and later picked up by Vice. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance has been monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday, amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Vladimir Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added. He said Nato had not noticed any changes in Russia’s “posture”, but would be monitoring it. Here’s more on the report that the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, spoke directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. According to Ian Bremmer’s mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Musk also appeared concerned about direct threats from Putin. From the Financial Times’ Max Seddon: President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Ahead of his meeting with the UN’s nuclear watchdog head, Putin said: We see that today there are elements of an excessively dangerous politicisation of everything connected with nuclear activity. We very much hope that, thanks to your efforts, we will be able to reduce all rhetoric and bring this area of our cooperation to normal, despite all the turbulence and complex processes that are taking place on the world stage. The Russian president said he was “happy” to discuss “all issues that are of mutual interest to us and may even cause concern to someone”: For example, as far as the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is concerned. In any case, we are open to this dialogue and are glad to see you. Elon Musk spoke directly to Vladimir Putin before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia, according to a report. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer claimed Musk told him that the Russian president was “prepared to negotiate” if Crimea remained in Russian hands. Putin also reportedly insisted to the Tesla chief executive that Ukraine would have to accept permanent neutrality and recognise Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. According to Bremmer, Musk said Putin told him these goals would be reached “no matter what”, including the possible use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine invaded Crimea. Bremmer wrote that Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome”. Following the alleged conversation with Putin, Musk posted a Twitter poll with his suggestions for ending the war in Ukraine. Musk argued that to reach peace, Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula that it seized in 2014. He also proposed holding votes in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia that the Kremlin says it is annexing. “Russia leaves if that is will of the people,” he said. Ukraine has received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system, Der Spiegel magazine reported. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, confirmed yesterday that the first of four Iris-T SLM air defence systems would be delivered within days. Lambrecht’s statement, delivered hours after Russia unleashed a massive wave of aerial strikes on cities across Ukraine on Monday, said: The renewed missile fire on Kyiv and the many other cities show how important it is to supply Ukraine with air defence systems quickly. Russia’s attacks with missiles and drones terrorise the civilian population in particular. That is why we are now providing support especially with air defence weapons. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, is “firmly committed” to visiting Ukraine “as soon as possible”, Downing Street has said in the wake of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities this week. Asked about what impact the renewed threat of Russian strikes on Kyiv could have on a potential visit by Truss, a No 10 spokesperson said: I couldn’t get into the security considerations around trips like that nor could I get into speculation on dates. As you’ll appreciate, the Prime Minister is firmly committed to visiting as soon as possible. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They vowed to hold President Vladimir Putin and those responsible for the attacks on Ukraine to account. They also said they would “never recognise” Russia’s “illegal annexation” of Ukrainian territory or “the sham referenda that Russia uses to justify it”. The statement continued: No country wants peace more than Ukraine, whose people have suffered death, displacement and countless atrocities as the result of Russian aggression. Leaders “deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps’, including the partial mobilisation of reservists and “irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, it said: We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. It added: We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation” after two days of widespread strikes on cities across Ukraine. The Russian leader “is now in the final stage of his reign” and is “a threat to all of us”, Zelenskiy said during the video address to G7 leaders. He also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia: When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work. The Ukrainian president thanked Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for speeding up the delivery of the IRIS-T air defence system and the US president, Joe Biden, for deliveries of air defence systems. He also asked G7 leaders to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country: I am asking you to strengthen the overall effort to help financially with the creation of an air shield for Ukraine. Millions of people will be grateful to the Group of Seven for such assistance. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, warned on Monday of even more “severe retaliation” following Saturday’s attack on the Kerch bridge linking Russia and Crimea. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to residents to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, said the mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. On Monday, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. Nato is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg said. He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Six people have been injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region, according to reports. Russia targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in a series of coordinated attacks across Ukraine for the second day in a row on Tuesday. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. Çavuşoğlu urged “a viable ceasefire and a just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, according to the head of the British spy agency GCHQ. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. Hello, Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March, but still expect more than 100 UN states to vote against Russia’s actions. The UN general assembly is due to vote on Wednesday or Thursday on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of Eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The motion has been carefully worded to draw maximum support, stressing the need for dialogue and the inviability of national borders. But even so, many African and Gulf states are refusing to take sides. In March, in the immediate wake of the invasion, 141 countries opposed Russia’s action, 35 abstained and five supported Russia. The diplomats said Russia had been “trying very hard in Africa to frame this as a west versus the rest conflict”, adding “lots of things play into these votes that are not necessarily the question in hand”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, last week visited the foreign ministers of Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast on his first African tour since the Russian offensive. He is also trying to build what Ukraine admits has been previously inadequate contacts in India and China. A western diplomat said: To any straight-thinking person this is a slam dunk, but countries relationships with each other and their interdependencies are complex and very messy. But western diplomats said an “important shift” was under way amongst some powerful non-aligned countries that had shown themselves “increasingly uncomfortable” with Putin. The diplomats pointed to a Chinese official statement reaffirming the importance of national sovereignty, and the urging by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for an end to the fighting. India, the diplomat pointed out, is dependent on Russia for oil and military equipment: They think twice about whether they can afford to trim their principles or more probably rely on countries like the UK to defend them and to allow them to operate in a slightly grey area. The sources added that they “could not see China cutting Russia adrift since it would fear that Russia might ultimately be drawn into the western orbit”. But they claim the repeated requirement of Russia to go in front of the UN General Assembly to explain why it is using its veto to then to be defeated humiliatingly is having the cumulative effect of making Russia feel diplomatically isolated. “It is a case of reducing the space for authoritarian dictators”, the source said. Russia, it was pointed out, has in recent months been thrown off the UN Human Rights Council board for UN women, and the board for Unicef, and efforts are under way to squeeze them off the UN Economic and Social Committee. Ukraine has been calling for Russia to be declared a terrorist state, a move that could have an impact on Russia’s seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council, although that is extremely unlikely under the existing rules. The US is likely to say if about 100 member states in the General Assembly vote to support the EU resolution that compares favourably with the vote held in 2014 at the time of the annexation of Ukraine. • This post was amended on 18 October 2022. An earlier version said that Russia being declared a terrorist state would see it “lose its seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council”. However, there is nothing in the UN charter that explicitly states this, and the wording has been amended accordingly. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said Russia’s possible use of nuclear weapons is highly unpredictable. Speaking to reporters after the virtual G7 meeting on Russia’s invasion fo Ukraine, Kishida said: The situation does not at all allow any prediction. It requires serious, close attention. For the past 77 years, the world has continued to put a stop to using nuclear weapons. This history of not using nuclear weapons must continue further. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations, called on leaders to support the international mission. He told G7 leaders: Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war, playing a provocation that we are allegedly preparing an attack on this country. It comes after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and western backers. During the G7 meeting, which has now ended, Zelenskiy also called on leaders to give Ukraine enough air defence capabilities to defend itself against Russia, as well as tough new sanctions on Moscow. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. The Nato military alliance “is not party” to the conflict in Ukraine, Stoltenberg said during a news conference. “But our support is playing a key role,” he added. Allies remained “united in their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-defence”, he said. Stoltenberg told reporters: Ukraine has the momentum and continues to make significant gains. While Russia is increasingly resorting to horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure. President Putin is “failing in Ukraine” and his “attempted annexations, partial mobilisation, and reckless nuclear rhetoric represent the most significant escalation since the start of the war”, he said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added: Russia knows that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We are closely monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s posture. But we remain vigilant. The speech was heavily trailed, but here is what Jeremy Fleming, head of the British spy agency GCHQ, had to say about Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this afternoon: Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machines spouted, it is clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefields and in cyberspace is turning the tide. Having failed in two major military strategies already. Putin’s plan has hit the courageous reality of Ukrainian defence. With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision making has proved flawed. Yesterday’s attacks in Kyiv and across Ukraine are another example. It is a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed, and the costs to Russia in people and equipment are staggering. We know – and Russian military commanders know – that their supplies and ammunition are running out. Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners as reinforcements, and now the mobilisation of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a really desperate situation. And the Russian people have started to understand all of that, too. They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudge the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realising they can no longer travel, and they know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they’re feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice. During her foreign ministry briefing, Russia’s Maria Zakharova has also expressed Russian displeasure with Moldova and Estonia. She said Russia was concerned at statements by Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, and was also concerned about an incident affecting Russian diplomats in Moldova. Zakharova also accused the west of hypocrisy in not criticising Ukrainian officials for statements that appear to support violence, accusing the west of “conniving at Kyiv’s impunity”. While Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking to the media about nuclear exercises, and the GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming has been giving his lecture, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has also been giving a briefing. The key point to emerge so far appears to be that Russia has not yet formally received a Turkish proposal to host peace talks between Moscow and western countries. The Kremlin says it has not ruled out that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could discuss a Turkish proposal to host peace talks when they meet on Thursday, but the foreign ministry said it is yet to hear about this through diplomatic channels. Nato’s Jen Stoltenberg has given details of Nato’s annual nuclear deterrence training exercises, which are scheduled for next week, and unlikely to ease nuclear tensions between the alliance and Russia. Stoltenberg said “This is routine training which happens every year to keep our deterrence safe, secure and effective. President Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are dangerous and irresponsible. Russia knows that a nuclear war can never be won and can never be fought.” The FT reports that the weeklong ‘Steadfast Noon’ exercise will “involve 14 Nato alliance members, and nuclear-capable aircraft alongside additional capabilities such as intelligence and refuelling planes. The weeklong exercise is to ensure that relevant personnel and equipment are prepared.” Jeremy Fleming, the head of GCHQ, is about to start speaking. RUSI is the Royal United Services Institute. The title of the lecture is “If China is the Question, What is the Answer?”, but he is expected to also address the UK’s views on Russia’s current campaign in Russia. You should be able to watch it in the video window above the live blog. It is being chaired by Shashank Joshi, defence editor of the Economist. The speech was previewed earlier by our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh. We have got a video feed of GCHQ head Jeremy Fleming’s speech this afternoon at the top of the live. It is due to start shortly. You may have to refresh the page to get the play button to appear. The Kyiv Independent, citing a Facebook post by the operators DTEK, is reporting that six people were injured in a second strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region. The post reads: Unfortunately, the LTPP has suffered a second blow from Russian terrorist troops. This happened at the moment when rescuers were working on site. There are some victims. According to preliminary information, there are six people. The victims were promptly provided medical care, they were taken to the hospital. There are no employees of the company among the injured. As a result of the shelling, the company’s energy equipment was damaged again. When the security situation will allow, workers will start with repairs. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has said that repairs are already underway to the glass bridge in Kyiv popular with tourists which was struck by Russian missiles yesterday. He posted to Telegram, alongside some images, saying that replacement glass had been ordered and would take three weeks. He said: Soon our renovated bridge will once again delight the residents of Kyiv and guests of the capital. Because it is now not only one of the tourist symbols of Kyiv, but also a symbol of the indomitability and stability of Ukraine. The White House has confirmed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, joined President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders for their virtual meeting today. The call began at 13:09 GMT, the White House said. We’ll bring you more information about the G7 meeting as soon as we hear it. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. “Unfortunately [both sides] have quickly moved away from diplomacy” since the talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul in March, Çavuşoğlu said in a televised interview, cited by AFP. The situation “gets worse and more complicated” as the war drags on, he said: A ceasefire must be established as soon as possible. The sooner the better. He called for a “just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, adding: A process that will ensure Ukraine’s border and territorial integrity should start. Without a ceasefire, it is not possible to talk about those issues in a healthy way: a viable ceasefire and a just peace. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed earlier. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk, a deputy director general for human resources at the nuclear plant, was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. It said Russian kidnappers were “probably using methods of torture” on Martynyuk in an attempt to obtain information from the personnel files of the Zaporizhzhia staff “in order to force Ukrainian staff to work for Rosatom [the Russian state-owned nuclear power supplier] as soon as possible”. Energatom appealed to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and the international community to “take all possible measures” for Martynyuk’s immediate release. In September, the director general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was detained by Russia while on his way from the plant, Europe’s largest, to the town of Enerhodar. Ihor Murashov was later released, the IAEA confirmed. The bodies of 62 Ukrainian soldiers have been “returned home” following “difficult negotiations”, Ukraine’s ministry responsible for temporarily-occupied territories has said. The ministry said it had negotiated the return of the soldiers’ remains, including servicemen killed at the Olenivka prison, in a statement on social media. It said: Another transfer took place: 62 fallen heroes were returned home. Olenivka prison, in Russian-occupied Donetsk, was bombed in an attack in July that left at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war dead, according to both the Ukrainian and Russian authorities. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the attack. A meeting between Group of Seven leaders and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was scheduled to begin a few moments ago at 1200 GMT. G7 leaders are expected to discuss their commitment to support Ukraine and hold President Vladimir Putin accountable for Russia’s aggression, including its recent missile strikes across Ukraine, the White House said yesterday. President Zelenskiy is scheduled to participate at the top of the meeting, where he will ask leaders to urgently supply Ukraine with air defence weapons. Speaking with reporters earlier today, the Kremlin said it had limited expectations of the G7 meeting. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The mood of this summit is already obvious and predictable. The confrontation will continue. Belarus has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. In a statement, the Belarusian defence ministry said: The tasks of the Regional Grouping of Forces are purely defensive. All the activities currently being carried out are aimed at responding adequately to actions near our borders. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, the statement continued. It also said it would begin a military inspection today to ensure “combat readiness”: During the inspection, military units and sub-units will work out the issues of putting on combat readiness. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Monday he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. The remarks by Lukashenko mark a potential further escalation of the war in Ukraine, possibly with a combined Russian-Belarus joint force in the north of Ukraine. Our Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, writes that the first deaths are being reported among Russians who were mobilised late last month. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. The meeting will take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, the Kremlin spokesperson said. Dmitry Peskov had told reporters yesterday that it was “possible” the two leaders would discuss a Turkish proposal to host talks between Russia and the west on peace in Ukraine. The pair will meet on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia summit in the Kazakhstan capital. They last met in mid-September in Uzbekistan on the sidelines of a summit of the leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. My colleague Peter Beaumont writes that he has seen a number of newly mobilised Russian fighters who have arrived on the frontline of the war with barely any training, including around the town of Svatove in Luhansk region. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. Lavrov said: This is a lie. We have not received any serious offers to make contact. He suggested Russia was willing to listen to any suggestions regarding peace talks: We have repeatedly said that we never refuse meetings. If there is a proposal, then we will consider it. Speaking about the possibility that Turkey could host talks between Russia and the west, Lavrov said Moscow would be willing to listen to any suggestions but could not say in advance whether this would lead to results. He said Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, would have the opportunity to put forward proposals to Putin when both visit Kazakhstan this week. Lavrov also claimed the US had long been involved in the war in Ukraine, which he said was “being controlled by the Anglo-Saxons”. Russia’s defence ministry has confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure today. In a statement, it said: The purpose of the strike has been achieved. All designated facilities have been hit. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting energy facilities to create “unbearable conditions for civilians”. Kuleba wrote: These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians - Russia’s deliberate strategy since months. A children’s doctor working at a cancer hospital in Kyiv was reportedly among those killed by yesterday’s wave of Russian strikes on cities across Ukraine. Oksana Leontieva was a doctor in the children’s bone marrow transplant department at the Okhmatdyt children’s cancer hospital, according to the hospital. She was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. In a statement on Facebook, the hospital described Leontieva as a “dedicated and responsible person and doctor” who was a “true professional and support for her patients and colleagues”. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said her five-year-old son is now an orphan, having lost his father six months ago. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Strikes continued on Tuesday. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. Governor Maksym Kozytskyi has said “At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region”. Mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to resident to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions. The Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck on Tuesday morning. Regional head Serhiy Borzov said: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” There has been a lengthy air raid warning in place all morning in Kyiv, with governor Oleksiy Kuleba claiming that at least one rocket had been shot down. Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has claimed that air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has said that “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from Vladimir Putin. Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready. Fleming is expected to say in a rare public speech delivered later on Tuesday that Putin is making strategic errors due to unconstrained power. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. “With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision-making has proved flawed” The deployment of a joint task-force of Russian and Belorussian troops within Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Prystaiko also said that Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, and said that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, France’s foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. Thérèse Coffey, deputy prime minister of the UK, said Monday’s strikes showed “this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces.” The German chancellor has attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling “the most outrageous terrorist organisations” after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked. Andriy Sadovyi, mayor of Lviv, has asked residents to store a small supply of water in anticipation that there may be outages later today following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region and has knocked out electricity in some parts of the city. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. She stated that the oppositions position was: Belarus must officially withdraw from Russian war participation. Every Russian soldier must leave Belarus unconditionally. All involved in Russia’s attack from Belarus must be held accountable. Democratic Belarus and Ukraine should build an alliance against Russian aggression. Tsikhanouskaya has been in exile since Alexander Lukashenko claimed his own victory in the August 2020 election in Belarus. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, has posted an update to Telegram saying: At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region. Information about victims is yet to be received. The danger still continues. The Lviv region borders Poland, and is one of the furthest regions of Ukraine from the four areas in the east which Russia partially occupies and has claimed to “annex”. A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Reuters reports Ravina Shamdasani told a news conference on Tuesday “We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalation, and to take all feasible measures to prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.” Moscow has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians and civilian infrastructure during what it has termed its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite the widespread evidence of damage to civilian areas and the discovery of mass graves in areas formerly occupied by invading Russian troops. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said on the Telegram messaging app that parts of the city are again without electricity following what he described as a “rocket attack on a critical infrastructure facility.” More details soon … Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has just posted to Telegram to say “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. There are reports of explosions in Lviv, which have impacted electricity supplies. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, has posted to Telegram: “Explosions are heard in Lviv. There are problems with electricity.” The regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has posted a similar message. At 12.08pm local time he wrote: “An attack on an energy facility in Lviv region. Stay in shelters. Do not spread photos, videos and rumours.” Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has posted to Telegram to claim that so far today air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. He told residents to stay in shelters as “the attack continues”. The region borders Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, three of the occupied areas of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Ukrinform is reporting that the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck this morning. It quotes the regional head, Serhiy Borzov, as saying: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” The report says that emergency services are at the scene. The mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. He told viewers of Sky News in the UK: “The Belorussian case is difficult because they are on top of Ukraine, the north of Ukraine. The danger this is actually posing is to cut the supply lines. We are receiving everything from the west, they’re coming through these western borders.” However, he also said one factor that might be causing the Belarus leader Lukashenko to be cautious was that “some people believe he’s not mobilising people because he is not sure whether the Kalashnikov’s will be turned against him maybe”. Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, according to Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Vadym Prystaiko also told viewers of Sky News that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” On diminishing weapons stockpiles, he said: “What Russians are using now is old rockets from the 1960s, the 1970s. What they’re doing, more or less, utilising some of the rockets that used to be quite sophisticated, now they are throwing them like dumb bombs. So they are running out of sophisticated equipment, that’s for sure. “But it has been research done for many years how the new wars will look like, and how fast the sides will run out of sophisticated equipment, and we’ll have to get back to all of this 1960s when they can actually fix the old tank with a hammer and just simple simple instruments.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. “We, the presidents of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia condemn the mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities recently carried out by Russia, which constitute war crimes under international law,” Reuters reports they said in a statement. Here are the quotes from head of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming’s interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. PA Media quotes him saying: We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends. We’ve seen, because of the declaration for mobilisation, that it’s running short of troops. So I think the answer to that is pretty clear. Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine. The word I’ve used is ‘desperate’. We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine. It certainly doesn’t imply complacency. Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine. Fleming was also asked about the prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons. “I would hope that we will see indicators if they started to go down that path,” he said. “But let’s be really clear about that, if they are considering that, that would be a catastrophe in the way that many people have talked about.” The German chancellor has this morning attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Speaking at an engineering conference, Reuters reports that Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Scholz added that Germany was almost at the target of having its gas storage facilities 95% full. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is making a rare public appearance today, with a speech planned later on. He is also appearing on the BBC’s Today programme, where he has been interviewed about Russia and China. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has been listening. The Russian foreign ministry’s social channels are this morning pushing out links to a response that the foreign ministry spokesperson gave late yesterday to recent statements coming from the US. In it, Maria Zakharova says: We repeat for the US once again: the objectives we set in Ukraine will be achieved. Russia is open to diplomacy, the terms are known. The longer Washington encourages Kiev’s bellicosity, encouraging rather than preventing terrorist incursions by Ukrainian saboteurs, the more difficult the search for a diplomatic settlement will become. Official figures from Ukraine suggest that yesterday at least 19 people were killed and more than 100 civilians were wounded after Russia launched a barrage of more than 80 missiles and rockets at cities throughout Ukraine, well away from the frontline of the occupied territory which the Russian Federation claims to have “annexed”. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, has just reported in the last minutes on Telegram “another shot down rocket. We stay in the shelters.” Today’s First Edition newsletter has Archie Bland talking to Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, and to Peter Beaumont, who is in Kyiv. Here’s an extract: The vital question over the next few days, Peter said, is whether “this is a screw-you retaliatory strike or the start of something bigger and more serious”. But there are doubts over whether Russia has the stocks of missiles to maintain such an approach, as Dan Sabbagh notes in this analysis. The chief of GCHQ will say in a rare speech today that Russian forces are exhausted and their supplies of munitions are running out. “These attacks don’t make a lot of sense for the military picture on the ground,” Peter said. “Shooting up cities doesn’t advance your troops. What I think would worry Ukraine more is some change on the frontlines.” In that context, there may be more concern over the news yesterday that Russian forces will be allowed to return to Belarus, potentially stretching Ukrainian forces further on the northern border. Meanwhile, as G7 leaders meet today, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in attendance, western leaders appear to have acknowledged the renewed urgency of the case for additional help: Germany said it would begin to deliver four long-awaited advanced air defence systems in the next few days, while Joe Biden also pledged the provision of advanced air defence systems in a call with Ukraine’s president yesterday. “Those systems aren’t infallible,” Peter said. “But you cannot have a conversation with anyone in this country, whether they’re a farmer in Kherson or a senior official, where they don’t come up.” Behind all of this is an unthinkable threat: nuclear attack. “Everybody here knows it’s a shoe that hasn’t dropped, and it overshadows life to some degree,” Peter said. “But one of the features of the last few days is that if something like what happened to the Kerch bridge doesn’t prompt that, when it was so humiliating for Putin, we may have a long way to go to get there.” You can read it in full here: Tuesday briefing – After Russia retaliates, what might happen next? The Ukrainian MP Volodymyr Ariev has told Sky News in the UK that he believed Vladimir Putin launched the wave of attacks so he could look like a strong leader at the G20 summit in Bali, rather than a weak one who had been losing ground in Ukraine. He said: We understand that it was planned in advance. Putin would like to present it like a response to the explosion on the Crimea bridge, but it hasn’t been proven who was behind that attack. But for Putin it makes no sense to find a truthful reason for escalation in Ukraine. The reason for it, for me, is pretty understandable. In one month, Putin is going to the meeting of G20 countries in Indonesia. So he would like to present himself not a weak leader, after defeats of the Russian army on conventional battlegrounds. He would like to speak to the world from a position of strength. So that’s why he changed the commander of operations against Ukraine, and his first day was an airstrike to scare Ukraine. Of course, Ukrainians were not scared. The missile attacks on Ukrainian cities yesterday were mostly well away from the front line, where Ukrainian forces had been making progress in both the Donbas to the north and towards Kherson in the south in recent weeks. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Kherson, has messaged on Telegram this morning to claim that pro-Russian forces have been repulsed in Kherson, as well as an attack on the key Antonovsky bridge. He also wrote: The denazification of the Ukronazis and the fascist leadership of Ukraine continues. The time has come for residents of the remaining Ukraine to see clearly and stop self-destruction for the sake of the collective West. Separately, an appeal to the Ukronazis – stop hiding behind playgrounds, you will all be condemned as war criminals. Stremousov provided no evidence to back up his claims. The Russian Federation has claimed to “annex” Kherson region after a widely-derided “referendum”, despite not being in full control of the territory. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is expected to make a rare public address later today at the Rusi thinktank, and parts of what he will say have been briefed out in advance. Dan Sabbagh reports: The GCHQ director will highlight the costs to Russia from the months of fighting, arguing that Moscow’s forces have become exhausted and its recent mobilisation of conscripts shows signs of desperation. “We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” he will say. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. Fleming is also expected to speak about the future threat posed by China, according to a pre-released extract of the remarks. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s report here: GCHQ head – Putin making strategic errors due to unconstrained power The Interfax news agency in Russia reports that there are now four ferries plying the route across the Kerch Strait between Russia and Crimea. The service runs every two hours, reports Interfax, and a return journey takes four hours. It is to replace the road and rail link of the Kerch bridge, which was hit by an explosion at the weekend causing a section to partially collapse. The Russian Federation annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state emergency services have updated their count of the dead and wounded from yesterday’s attacks. In a message posted to Telegram earlier this morning, the agency said that “according to preliminary data, 19 people died, there were another 105 injured”. The service also said that over 1,000 people and 120 units were involved in extinguishing fires and emergency rescue operations yesterday. They suggest that around 300 settlements in four oblasts remains without power. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has stated on Telegram that electricity supplies have been restored to everywhere in the region, and that electricity and water supplies have been fully restored in the city of Lviv. The areas suffered outages yesterday after Russian strikes, leading to power failures that included at one point border crossings between Ukraine and Poland. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update for his region to the Telegram messaging app. He gave the casualty count in the last 24 hours for Mykolaiv as one woman killed. He said that yesterday air defence systems destroyed 14 cruise missiles over Mykolaiv. He also claims that between 3.30am and 5,30am local time this morning Ukrainian forces destroyed five “Shahed-136” kamikaze drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Thérèse Coffey, who is deputy prime minister of the UK, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning. She was asked what the UK could do to offer further support to Ukraine following yesterday’s wave of Russian missile strikes on cities. She called for other countries to offer support, saying: We have been continuing the support that we’ve been giving. The prime minister [Liz Truss] was foreign secretary beforehand, working in step with our defence secretary Ben Wallace and at the time prime minister Boris Johnson, and we continue to do that. So we need to make sure that the west is also resolved to making sure that Putin must fail. And the people of Ukraine succeed. Pressed on something specific the UK could offer, she continued: Well, of course, some of these operational matters, of the direct support [that] will be given will be discussed confidentially, both within government, but also with the Ukrainian president. And I know that we have always stepped up to deliver what we can. But this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces, as we have done Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, French foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio, Reuters reports. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said yesterday that he had ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers. This is Martin Belam taking on the live blog in London. You can message me at martin.belam@theguardian.com That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the latest for the next while. Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner said on Monday he has renounced his Russian citizenship after leaving the country in 2014. Milner is the founder of internet investment firm DST Global, and made a fortune by betting on Chinese tech companies like e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com. “My family and I left Russia for good in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea,” Milner said in a tweet. “And this summer, we officially completed the process of renouncing our Russian citizenship.” Milner has been an Israeli citizen since 1999 and has not visited Russia since 2014, according to a fact sheet on DST Global’s website. Milner also has no assets in Russia, 97% of his personal wealth was created outside of the country and “Yuri has never met Vladimir Putin, either individually or in a group,” according to the website. Ukraine’s state emergency service has reported that the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities on 10 October has risen to 19, with the number of injured rising to over 105. Hong Kong’s leader John Lee said Tuesday he will implement only United Nations sanctions – not US, UK or EU sanctions – after the US warned the territory’s status as a financial centre could be affected if it acts as a safe haven for sanctioned individuals, AP reports. Lee’s statement Tuesday came days after a luxury yacht connected to Russian tycoon Alexey Mordashov docked in the city. Mordashov, who is believed to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sanctioned by the US, UK and the European Union in February after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hong Kong authorities have said that they do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other governments. “We cannot do anything that has no legal basis,” Lee told reporters. “We will comply with United Nations sanctions, that is our system, that is our rule of law,” he said. A US State Department spokesperson said in a statement Monday that “the possible use of Hong Kong as a safe haven by individuals evading sanctions from multiple jurisdictions further calls into question the transparency of the business environment.” The State Department spokesperson also said the city’s reputation as a financial centre “depends on its adherence to international laws and standards.” The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update from Ukraine, reporting that “the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that General Sergei Surovikin had been appointed as overall commander of its Joint Group of Forces conducting the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine” on 8 October. “For much of its operation, Russia has likely lacked a single empowered field commander,” the MoD tweeted. “Surovikin’ s appointment likely reflects an effort by the Russian national security community to improve the delivery of the operation. However, he will likely have to contest with an increasingly factional Russian MOD which is poorly resourced to achieve the political objectives it has been set in Ukraine.” Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emine Dzheppar, reports that Russia fired at least fifteen rockets on Zaporizhzhia last night, targeting “an educational institution, a medical institution and residential buildings.” Citing the Oblast Military Administration, media outlet Ukrainska Pravda reports that that Ladyzhynska power plant in the southwestern city of Vinnytsia was shelled a short while ago by two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. Reuters reports via RIA that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned the US and Nato against “the West’s growing involvement in the Ukrainian conflict”, saying that Moscow would respond and hope[s] that they realise the danger of uncontrolled escalation in Washington and other Western capitals”. Ukranian state news agency Ukrinform reports that 98 miners are still trapped underground following Russia’s shelling of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelensky’s home town. Power outages caused by the strikes have left 98 miners stick underground., the news agency reports, with rescuers working to release them. Almost 900 miners had been trapped in four mines following the strikes, but most have since been freed. Despite – or because of – yesterday’s missile strikes on several Ukranian cities, people in Lviv, which was among the cities targeted by Russia, went dancing last night. Wall Street Journal correspondent Matthew Luxmoore posted the below video on Twitter late on Monday night, adding that “Ukranian songs were interspersed tonight with chants of ‘Death to Enemies!’ and ‘Putin is a dick’!’” Air rid sirens are sounding this morning in Kyiv, the BBC’s Paul Adams and others report, as Ukrainians wake up after yesterday’s strikes in cities across the country, which have killed 14 people and left almost 100 injured. Further strikes were reported in Zaporizhizhia overnight. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. “Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. By launching missile attacks on civilians, sleeping in their homes or rushing to work, children going to schools, Russia has proven once again that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the strongest possible ways,” he said. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling ‘the most outrageous terrorist organisations’ after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming is expected to add in a rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. There are a few events and meetings planned for today, so here is a summary of what we can expect, among the unexpected: G7 leaders will hold crisis talks with Zelenskiy in attendance. The leaders are likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders to happen in the coming days United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership. The UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss, is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in coming days as the G7 holds crisis talks on Tuesday following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia. The G7 video call will also be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. G7 leaders are also likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues, PA reports. Ukraine stepped up calls for western allies to provide anti-air and anti-missile systems in response to Monday’s strikes, which have so far killed 14 and injured 97. Kyiv was targeted for the first time in months, while Russia also hit civilian areas and energy infrastructure across the country, from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv near the Polish border. The death toll from Russia’s strikes on Kyiv and other cities on 10 October has risen to 14, while 97 have been injured, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. More than 1,300 settlements across the country were without power, the emergency service said. Many of the locations hit by cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during the morning rush hour appeared to be solely civilian sites or key pieces of infrastructure, apparently chosen to terrorise Ukrainians. Oleksandr Starukh, Governor of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, announced the attacks overnight in a post on Telegram: “The occupier attacked the regional center with rockets. Infrastructure objects became the targets of the enemy. Information about the destruction and victims is being ascertained.” Zaporizhzhia was also hit in the 10 October strikes. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time that, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. We will bring you more shortly. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest as it happens. If there is news you think we may have missed, let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. Meanwhile the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukraine on 10 October has risen to 14, with the number of injured rising to 97, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in the coming days, as G7 leaders hold crisis talks on Tuesday, with Ukraine’s president, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, attending, following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was “dealing with terrorists” and accused Russia of targeting power facilities and civilians following the missile attacks. “They deliberately chose such a time, such goals, in order to cause as much harm as possible,” the Ukrainian leader said. US president Joe Biden said the US “strongly condemns” the Russian missile strikes on cities across Ukraine, which demonstrate Putin’s “utter brutality” against the Ukrainian people. In a separate statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the international community “has a responsibility” to make clear that Putin’s actions are “completely unacceptable”. The United Nations general assembly voted to reject Russia’s call for the 193-member body to hold a secret ballot later this week on whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Diplomats said the vote on the resolution would likely be on Wednesday or Thursday. Australian troops could help train Ukraine’s armed forces following Russia’s “appalling” attack on Kyiv, the country’s Defence Minister, Richard Marles, said on Tuesday. Members of the Group of Seven, and Zelenskiy, will hold emergency talks on Tuesday, a German government spokesperson has confirmed. Zelenskiy confirmed he would address G7 leaders, adding that he had spoken to Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about increasing pressure on Russia as well as aid for Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has been included on a list of wanted persons put together by Ukraine security officials. A statement released by Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, said Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security, was wanted under a section of the criminal code dealing with attempts to undermine Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. Most of the Russian Security Council’s members are on the list. The International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed its teams have paused their field work in Ukraine for security reasons. The Norwegian Refugee Council have also said that it has paused its aid operations in Ukraine until it is safe to resume. “Our aid workers are hiding from a barrage of bombs and in fear of repeated attacks,” it said. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin, UAE state media reported. Mohamed “will discuss with President Putin the friendly relations between the UAE and Russia along with a number of regional and international issues and developments of common interest”, the UAE’s state-owned news agency WAM said. The European Union has announced it will extend a bloc-wide protection scheme for Ukrainian refugees into 2024. Ukrainians in the EU who choose to return to their country will still be able to maintain their refugee status, as long as they notify the relevant EU country of their move, according to the EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson.",

The head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration, Oleksandr Vilkul, said Russia launched rocket fire overnight on an energy facility, causing “serious destruction” Ukrainian forces shot down 13 “kamikaze” drones over Mykolaiv overnight, according to the region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim. An attempt to retake control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by boats loaded with Ukrainian special forces has been repulsed, according to one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are working to create mobile power points after Russia launched new strikes against the country’s energy infrastructure, President Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy held a “strategic meeting” with senior officials today to discuss measures to “eliminate the consequences in the event of a breakdown of the energy system of Ukraine”, he said on Telegram. Ukraine has withdrawn its ambassador to Kazakhstan after a row over Petro Vrublevsky;s comments about killing Russians. Russia’s strikes on critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine are “acts of pure terror” that amount to war crimes, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said. The Belarus defence ministry said in a statement that it has begun summoning citizens to check their eligibility for military service, but that it is not planning mobilisation. The military registration and enlistment activities are strictly routine and are expected to be completed by the end of this year,” it said. The White House is taking “every step possible” to avoid a direct encounter between President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month, according to reports. US officials are also reportedly taking measures to avoid even a hallway run-in or photo meeting between the two leaders. Finland’s main political parties have backed building a fence along parts of the country’s border with Russia, with work on a short pilot section expected to start as soon as funds have been allocated, Finnish media have reported. Israel’s defence minister has reiterated that the country will not sell weapons to Ukraine, despite a request from Kyiv for air defence supplies in the face of Russia’s growing use of Iranian-made drones. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Russia no longer sees a need to maintain a diplomatic presence in the west, the Daily Beast reports. “There is neither point nor desire to maintain the previous presence in western states.

The Iranians were reported to have been deployed to help Russian troops deal with problems with the Tehran-supplied fleet of Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Iran has deepened its commitment to supplying arms for Russia’s assault on Ukraine by agreeing to provide a batch of medium-range missiles, as well as large numbers of cheap but effective drones, according to US and Iranian security officials. Russian airstrikes have destroyed 30% of Ukraine’s power stations since 10 October, causing massive blackouts across the country, said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. Russian strikes on Tuesday hit a power plant in Kyiv, killing three people, as well as energy infrastructure in Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south.

Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels.<strong> </strong>Speaking to the EU summit via video link, the Ukrainian president’s account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed where the fighting has been fiercest was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him.</p></li> <li><p>Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor said.<strong> Gen Andriy Kostin</strong> said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong>, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired security council, said Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.”</p></li> <li><p>Finland’s president, <strong>Sauli Niinistö</strong>, signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March.</p></li> <li><p>The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s <strong>Zaporizhzhia power plant</strong> “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in <strong>Rzhyshchiv</strong>, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p></li> <li><p>Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the <strong>Donetsk</strong> region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the <strong>Kherson</strong> region.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi</strong>, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking <strong>Bakhmut</strong> at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation.</p></li> <li><p>The UK <strong>Ministry of Defence</strong> said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.”</p></li> <li><p>Any attempt to arrest <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally <strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong> said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen.</p></li> <li><p>A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in <strong>Crimea</strong>, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Spain</strong>’s prime minister, <strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong>, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> with the Chinese president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, during an official visit to China next week.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Estonia</strong>’s prime minister, <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong>, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more.</p></li> <li><p>A former <strong>New Zealand</strong> soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed.

                    "bodyText": "We’re closing this blog down now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. Speaking to the EU summit via video link, the Ukrainian president’s account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed where the fighting has been fiercest was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired security council, said Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.” Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has now withdrawn its claim Russian troops had left Nova Kahkovka. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, in a rare retraction, said Russian troops remained in the town on the east bank of the Dnipro River. It said the initial report had been issued “as a result of incorrect use of available data” but gave no details. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, had denied the report. The EU has denounced Russian police raids against the Nobel prize-winning human rights group Memorial, describing them as being part of an intimidation and harassment campaign. Reuters, citing Memorial, reports that Russian security forces raided the homes of former employees of the group on Tuesday and took some of them in for questioning. Founded to document political repression in the Soviet Union, Memorial was officially banned in late 2021 after the authorities claimed it supported terrorism and extremism, charges the group called absurd. The spokesperson for the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said: The recent actions by the Russian authorities constitute yet another step in the ongoing intimidation and persecution of independent and critical voices in the Russian society. Memorial’s work in Russia has been invaluable in defence of human rights and against “attempts to manipulate the historical memory of political repression in Russia in the 20th century”, he added. The EU calls upon the Russian authorities to stop the unfounded prosecution and police harassment of Memorial and its staff – and to respect the rule of law. Tuesday’s raids were carried out after Russian investigators accused the now dissolved group of allegedly including the names of second world war-era Nazi collaborators on their historical list of victims of political terror. The raids were condemned by rights groups internationally as well as what remains of Russia’s domestic opposition, Reuters reports. We reported earlier that the Ukrainian military was claiming Russian forces had left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, has denied that. Reuters quotes him as saying on Telegram: All Russian military personnel in Nova Kakhovka, as well as in other locations on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro remain in their place. Russian forces redeployed to the east bank of the Dnipro River last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian athletes will remain barred from track and field “for the foreseeable future” because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said. The International Olympic Committee is exploring a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals at next year’s Olympic Games in Paris. But it appears likely they will not be able to feature in athletics in Paris, arguably the highest-profile Olympic sport. Lord Coe told a press conference: The World Athletics Council approved to continue to exclude Russian and Belarus athletes from all World Series events for the foreseeable future due to the invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine. Russian forces have left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian military’s general staff has said. Reuters quotes its evening report outlining conditions on the front lines as saying: As of 22 March 2023, all units of the occupying army that had been deployed in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region, have left the city. The town is located on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where Russian forces redeployed last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops. The report said Russian troops had stolen appliances, valuables, clothing and mobile telephones from nearby houses as they departed. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) during a ceremony on Thursday. Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. Hungary and Turkey, the only Nato members that have yet to ratify Finland’s membership, have both signalled they will soon do so. European Union leaders have held talks with the UN chief, António Guterres, on sanctions imposed on Russia and are also expected to endorse a plan to supply more artillery shells to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Guterres’ participation in the EU summit, where global food security was also discussed, comes days after the renewal of a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey on the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea that is seen as crucial to overcoming a global food crisis. The 27 EU leaders were also due to get an update on the war from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, via video link. Arriving for the two-day summit, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: We need to ensure that grain exports, for example from Ukraine, can continue. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, spoke against any easing of sanctions on Moscow under the grain deal and called for a tighter price cap on Russian oil exports. The US has pushed back against Russian demands that western sanctions be eased before Moscow allows Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports to continue beyond mid-May, saying there are no restrictions on Russian farm products or fertilisers. Inside the EU, the issue of fertiliser exports is blocking more sanctions against Russia’s ally Belarus. The bloc says new sanctions are needed to stop Belarus from serving as a route to bypass the existing Russia trade restrictions. But Lithuania opposes what it calls “fertiliser oligarch” exemptions proposed to ensure Belarusian fertilisers continue flowing to third countries, arguing that that would weaken the sanctions regime overall, diplomats said. Proponents say such carve-outs, similar to those the EU has in place under its sanctions against Russia, are necessary to ensure food security and refute Moscow’s charge that EU measures – rather than Russia’s invasion – are driving the global crisis. Diplomats involved in preparing the summit were sceptical of any imminent breakthrough. Earlier, William met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at the presidential palace, where they discussed the war in Ukraine. The former’s spokesperson said: The conversation was warm and friendly, and predominantly focused on the ongoing conflict with the war in Ukraine, particularly its impact on Polish society. The Prince of Wales took the opportunity to thank the president and the Polish people who have done so much to support the people of Ukraine who’ve fled here. They discussed the importance of the need for ongoing support to Ukraine and its people. The prince said he was very much looking forward to seeing the president and first lady at the coronation. He also thanked him for attending the late queen’s funeral. William also echoed his grandmother the queen by laying a wreath at a monument dedicated to soldiers. Queen Elizabeth II and the late Duke of Edinburgh did the same during their state visit to Poland in 1996. William was greeted by a guard of honour and carried the assortment of flowers to the monument, spending around 10 minutes there before leaving. On the wreath was a note reading: “In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.” The Prince of Wales has praised the resilience of young Ukrainian refugees living in Poland. William, on the second day of his surprise trip to the country, visited the Hala Koszyki food hall in Warsaw to speak to those who have fled Ukraine. He joined them at tables on Thursday afternoon and heard about their experiences settling into Polish life. William told them: It must be very difficult to start an entire new life in a new country. It’s amazing how resilient you are. That shines out. He also spoke to people who have hosted refugees, and thanked them for their kindness. William was greeted by well-wishers outside the venue and given flowers. Three women held a sign thanking him for the visit. One of them, Olga Mieszejewska-Buchalik, who travelled three hours from south Poland, told reporters: I said that we really appreciated his support for our nation and Ukraine. Vonya Bultruski, 26, who spoke to the prince, told the PA news agency: I told him how much his support for refugees means, he’s a very kind man. I’m very happy to see him in Poland, it is a big moment for my country. Marta Galinska, 47, a milliner, gave William a pink felt hat she made for the Princess of Wales. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. The Ukrainian president was speaking to the EU summit via video link, from a moving train in an undisclosed location in Ukraine, where he recounted news from the frontline. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy visited frontline military positions near the besieged city of Bakhmut, where he met Ukrainian serviceman and held a moment of silence for those killed in the war. Earlier today he was in Kherson region. His account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. On one occasion the secure line cut out, but was soon reconnected. According to an EU source, he warned European leaders of five factors that could prolong the war, including delays in the delivery of long-range missiles, lack of modern aircraft and weaknesses in western sanctions. EU leaders are now discussing the Russian invasion, where they are expected to endorse a decision to supply a million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months to replenish its dwindling stocks. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has this report from Kherson on its official Telegram channel, citing the state emergency department: Four fires broke out in the Kherson region during the day as a result of shelling by the Russian army. A warehouse was on fire in Kherson, a car and the remains of a cable caught fire in Beryslav. And in Antonivka, a private house and a non-residential building were on fire. The office of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have issued a couple of photographs of his visit to Kherson region today. It is Zelenskiy’s second trip outside Kyiv this week, having visited the frontline city of Bakhmut yesterday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, visited the occupied city of Mariupol on Saturday evening in his first trip to one of the areas that Russia has claimed to annex from Ukraine. Medvedev may have dismissed western claims that Russia is running out of weapons with which to continue its war on Ukraine, but Reuters is reporting that the conflict has left Moscow unable to deliver vital defence supplies it had committed to India’s military. New Delhi has been worried about just such a situation, with Moscow its largest source of defence equipment. An Indian air force statement on Thursday is the first official confirmation it has come about. The statement was made to a parliamentary committee, which published it on its website on Tuesday. An air force representative told the committee that Russia had planned a “major delivery” this year that would not take place. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in New Delhi told Reuters: “We don’t have information which may confirm the stated.” There has been no immediate response from Rosoboronexport, which is the Russian government’s weapons export arm. The report does not mention specifics of the delivery, Reuters says. Medvedev also dismissed any suggestion of talks with western European powers as “useless” and spoke contemptuously about western politicians, claiming a “catastrophic drop in competence and elementary literacy of EU leaders”. I have no illusions that we could communicate with them again any time soon. It makes no sense to negotiate with certain countries and blocs – they only understand the language of force. Medvedev, who heads a panel coordinating weapons production, derided western claims that Moscow is running out of weapons and said Russian weapons industries had increased output. He said Russia would produce 1,500 battle tanks this year and boost production of other weapons to meet its army’s needs. His claims could not be independently verified. The most important thing now is to make it all in necessary volumes, and we are launching new factories to do that. He said that the Russian military already had good intelligence drones and loitering munitions, but acknowledged that it had yet to deploy long-range strike drones. Here’s some more detail on those comments made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired Security Council, who we quoted earlier as saying that any attempt to arrest the Russian president would amount to a declaration of war. According to the Associated Press (AP), he has told reporters in Russia that Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer. Medvedev also denounced the ICC’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin as legally null and void, claiming the move added to a “colossal negative potential” in the already bitterly strained ties. Our relations with the west are already worse than they have ever been in history. Medvedev challenged Ukraine’s sovereignty in comments that could reflect Moscow’s plans to extend its gains. Honestly speaking, Ukraine is part of Russia. But, due to geopolitical reasons and the course of history, we had tolerated that we were living in separate quarters and had been forced to acknowledge those invented borders for a long time. The AP reports that, since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, Medvedev has emerged as one of the most hawkish Russian officials, with observers interpreting his position as an apparent attempt to curry favour with Putin. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the southern region of Kherson, where he toured local infrastructure the he promised to restore after Russia’s invasion. The visit, to a region where Ukraine staged a successful counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces late last year, was his second outside Kyiv this week, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, he visited troops near the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut. On Thursday, under footage of his visit to Kherson region that was posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote: I spoke with local residents about their current issues and needs. We will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. Just like with every city and village that suffered because of the occupiers. The Ukrainian counteroffensive last year pushed Russian troops out of the regional capital after months of occupation. Workers in the region are now busy restoring power and the water supply. In a separate post showing him inspecting energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian president wrote: We have to ensure full restoration and protection of our energy sector. I am grateful to everyone who works for this and returns the light to our people. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor has said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. He was speaking to Reuters after meeting the international criminal court (ICC)‘s chief prosecutor in The Hague, where the court is based. Last week, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him and his children’s commissioner of the war crime of deporting children from Ukraine to Russia. While the ICC can prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine, it cannot prosecute the crime of aggression due to legal constraints. International support is growing for the creation of a special tribunal that would prosecute Russian leaders for the 13-month-old invasion itself, considered by Ukraine and western leaders to be a crime of aggression. Kostin said the special tribunal should go after “the highest political and military leadership, including Putin, for the crime of aggression”. I believe that it could be (held) in absentia, because it’s important to deliver a matter of justice for international crimes even if perpetrators are not in the dock. International courts very rarely hold trials in absentia and the ICC’s rules state specifically that an accused suspect shall be present during trial. The only recent example of an international trial in absentia was in the case of Lebanon, for which a UN-backed tribunal convicted three men for the 2005 assassination of Lebanese politician Rafik Hariri. Russia has publicly said it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia in what it presents as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and abandoned children in the conflict zone. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. “We will also talk about Ukraine where the most important thing is to be able to guarantee a stable and lasting peace,” Reuters reports Sanchez told the media in Brussels. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to further squeeze Russia’s revenue. “We know that Russia is earning less from the oil. We see the economic sanctions, including the oil price cap, are having am effect on the Russian economy and their ability to fuel the war machine,” Reuters reports her saying on arriving to talks among the EU’s 27 national leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. “We should continue with that,” she said, adding that Estonia would agree to raise the cap again should oil prices rise. She spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia as sought by Moscow in the grain deal talks. “We shouldn’t weaken the sanctions,” she said. A video is circulating on social media, reported by Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move which is not widely recognised internationally. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. The Guardian has not independently verified the location, or the date the video was made. The air alarm which has been in force across Ukraine for much of the last two hours has ended. Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. The ICC issued an arrest warrant on Friday, accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bore individual criminal responsibility. Reuters reports that the hawkish former president Medvedev told Russian media that the ICC, which countries including Russia, China and the US do not recognise, was a “legal nonentity” that had never done anything significant. Any attempt to detain Putin, though, would be a declaration of war, said Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. “Let’s imagine – obviously this [is a] situation which will never be realised – but nevertheless let us imagine that it was realised: the current head of the nuclear state went to a territory, say Germany, and was arrested,” Medvedev said. “What would that be? It would be a declaration of war on the Russian Federation,” he said in a video posted on Telegram. “And in that case, all our assets – all our missiles – would fly to the Bundestag, to the Chancellor’s office.” Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this news roundup this morning on its official Telegram channel: As a result of an attack by Russian drones [yesterday] on a hostel in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, nine people were killed, the state emergency service reported. Rescue operations are completed. In the middle of the night, the Russian military shelled Kramatorsk in Donetsk region: residential buildings, a boiler house and garages were damaged. On 22 March, shelling in the region killed two people and injured four others. At night, the Russian army shelled the Kherson regional cardio centre; there were no casualties. Fifty-four times during the day, the Russian Federation fired heavy artillery and “Grad missiles” in the Kherson region; one person was killed, two were wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk and Kherson are two of the partly occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, has posted to Telegram to say: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He goes on to write that the enemy is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, [Balakliia] and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. He praised his troops for “superhuman resilience, courage and bravery” under “the continuous fire of the enemy’s artillery and aircraft”. An air alert is being declared across Ukraine.

The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on the situation in Ukraine. It writes: Since the start of March 2023, heavy fighting has continued in parts of the Svatove-Kremina sector of the frontline in northern Luhansk oblast. Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year. In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres. Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed in fighting there. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country’s unofficial involvement in Ukraine’s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month captured a moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out: “New Zealand! New Zealand!” “My brother!” Te Tai replied. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on March 9, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The statement continues: The situation at the plant remains perilous. The IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) team currently present at the plant was informed that restoration of the line had been planned for 5, 10 and then 13 March but had not been possible. The latest reconnection date is scheduled for 23 March. Six weeks after European leaders last gathered in Brussels, they’re meeting again for two days. The war in Ukraine is high on the agenda (though tensions between France and Germany over nuclear energy and combustion engines loom large) and UN secretary general, António Guterres, will be joining the summit for the first day. Among the items on the agenda over the next two days are, according to the council: Accountability of perpetrators Further increasing collective pressure on Russia The use of frozen assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine Support to help meet Ukraine’s military and defence needs Global food security Address high energy prices Reduce gas demand Ensure security of supply Phase out dependency on Russian fossil fuels Wording on the summit points out that the EU has “made available” €67bn (US$73bn) to Ukraine since the start of the war. That’s equivalent to about 27% of Ukraine’s total GDP for 2021, before Russia invaded. A months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to US, Ukrainian and British military experts. Russian forces unleashed a wave of air strikes in the north and south of Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin bid farewell on Wednesday to Chinese leader Xi Jinping following a two day visit to Moscow by his fellow autocrat and “dear friend”. Bakhmut is the site of Europe’s deadliest infantry battle since World War Two. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said in its most recent update that the pace of Russian operations around Bakhmut “appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions.” The update goes on to say: Russian forces are currently increasing the tempo of their offensive operations around Avdiivka aiming to encircle the settlement, and it is possible that Russian forces are doing so at the expense of their operations around Bakhmut and the stalled offensive around Vuhledar. British military intelligence believes Russia’s assault on the town could be running out of steam. There was still a danger, however, that the Ukrainian garrison in Bakhmut could be surrounded, Britain’s defence ministry said in its intelligence update on Wednesday. Ukraine’s military General Staff agreed that Russia’s offensive potential in Bakhmut was declining. Bakhmut has become a key objective for Moscow, which sees the town as a stepping stone toward completing its conquest of the eastern Donbas region. Hello and welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan taking you through the day’s news. Our top story this morning: Russia’s months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank. In its latest update, the ISW writes, “The tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions”. And the European Council is meeting today in Brussels, where leaders will discuss the war and Europe’s continuing support for Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will also take part in today’s meeting. We’ll bring you the latest on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said China is watching “very carefully” to see how Washington and the world respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the end of president Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow, Blinken said that if Russia was allowed to attack Ukraine with impunity, it would “open a Pandora’s box” for would-be aggressors and lead to a “world of conflict”. He added that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal aid to Moscow. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. At least one person was killed and 33 wounded by a twin Russian missile strike on two residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s east, according to officials. Footage from a security camera captured the moment the strike hit, causing an explosion and a large plume of smoke to rise from two nine-storey buildings. Residential areas “where ordinary people and children live are being fired at”, said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. At least eight people were killed overnight in a drone attack on Rzhyshchiv in the Kyiv region, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said. The strike is reported to have hit a dormitory building and a school. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that one of the people who died was “an ambulance driver who came to the call”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said the risk of a nuclear conflict is at its highest level in decades. Russia was committed to keeping the world “safe and free” from the threat of nuclear war, he said, but added later that business could not continue as usual, given that Moscow was now “in a de facto state of open conflict” with Washington. Rebuilding Ukraine’s economy is now expected to cost $411bn, 2.6 times Ukraine’s expected 2022 gross domestic product, a new study by the World Bank, United Nations, European Commission and Ukraine found. Sweden’s parliament has formally approved a bill to allow the country to join Nato. Sweden and its neighbour Finland applied to join Nato in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The process has been held up by Turkey, which along with Hungary has yet to ratify the memberships. Zelenskiy made a surprise visit on Wednesday to Ukrainian troops near the frontline city of Bakhmut. During his visit, the president heard “reports on the operational situation and the course of hostilities on the frontline”, a statement from his office said. Zelenskiy, dressed in a dark sweatshirt and military khaki trousers, was seen handing out medals to soldiers he said were heroically defending their country’s sovereignty. There is a possibility that the Russian assault on the town of Bakhmut is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. This could be happening because “some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors”, it said. The Prince of Wales travelled to Warsaw as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees.",

A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces.</li> \n   <li><strong>A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant</strong>, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak” in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/energoatom.ua/posts/pfbid0KTmFsk1EMUYwfZhpuCiKCXq6Lbo7fpkFPsm5EhnnLEWXLfFRNFA9TTtZj2Xk22dil\">statement</a> on Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles</strong>. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were.

Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3.30am. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak” in a statement on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made in response to a pledge from the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. “It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television. “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. Spain is also to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden whom aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will also provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports as cited by Reuters. Training would take place in Latvia, where the Spanish army has deployed 500 soldiers within the framework of Nato’s Enhanced Advanced Presence operation. A second phase of training could take place in Spain, according to the sources cited by El Pais. The paper said Spain’s defence ministry is finalising a delivery to Kyiv of low-level Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish army has replaced with a more advanced system. Spain has so far supplied ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. In May, Russia decided to stop supplying Gazprom Germania, which had been the German subsidiary of Gazprom, after Berlin put the company under trustee management due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Bundesnetzagentur energy regulator, acting as trustee, has had to buy replacement gas on the market to fulfil supply contracts with German municipal utilities and regional suppliers. Welt am Sonntag reported that Economy Minister Robert Habeck estimates an extra 10m cubic meters per day are required, which would currently cost about €3.5bn a year. Further costs arise from the filling of the Rehden natural gas storage facility which Habeck ordered on Wednesday, it said. The paper also said the additional costs would be passed on to energy suppliers and end customers in the form of a gas levy from October. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden. The annual BALTOPS naval exercise, initiated in 1972, is not held in response to any specific threat. But the military alliance said that “with both Sweden and Finland participating, Nato is seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength” together with two Nordic aspirant nations, according to a report from the Associated Press. Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join Nato in May as a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated warnings from Moscow against joining the western military alliance. Ahead of the naval drill, which involved 45 vessels and 75 aircraft, the top US military official said in Sweden the host of the BALTOPS 22 exercise that it was particularly important for Nato to show support to the governments in Helsinki and Stockholm. It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm. Milley said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato will be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas. The United States has never before moved such a large warship as the 843-foot USS Kearsarge in the Swedish capital, where it sailed through narrow passages in the Stockholm archipelago, Milley said. As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. Vice Adm. Gene Black, commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Nato and US Sixth Fleet, added: In past iterations of BALTOPS we’ve talked about meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Those challenges are upon us - in the here and now.” BALTOPS 22 is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on June 17. Participating nations include Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries will exercise a myriad of capabilities demonstrating the inherent flexibility of maritime forces. Exercise scenarios include amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, air defence, mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, unmanned underwater vehicles, and medical response, according to an official statement. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Serbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles. Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić will address the nation on Monday night regarding the cancellation of Lavrov’s visit to Belgrade, according to local media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. “The president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,” the statement read. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region’s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. “Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,” Starukh said. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since 28 April. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” he said. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Samantha Lock, in Australia. Thank you. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Yakovenko was placed in a pretrial detention centre, a press service representative of the border police said. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. A search of public records for wanted persons on the Interpol website for Yakovenko’s name did not produce any results on Sunday night. Ukraine and Belarus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yakovenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, from the Donetsk region, according to information on the parliament’s website. Fears have grown recently that Moldova could be drawn in to the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, after pro-Russian separatists in a breakaway region reported a number of attacks and explosions there, which they blamed on Kyiv. Moldova, a country of around 2.6 million people wedged between Ukraine and Romania, has taken a decisive pro-Western political turn since President Maia Sandu took office at the end of 2020, defeating a Moscow-aligned incumbent. The country has an ethnic Romanian majority but a large and influential Russian-speaking minority, and close economic ties to Moscow. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. “High-precision, long-range missiles fired by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the outskirts of Kyiv destroyed T-72 tanks supplied by eastern European countries and other armoured vehicles that were in hangars,” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since April 28. Several cruise missiles were fired towards Kyiv by Russian TU-95 planes from the Caspian Sea, one of which was destroyed, said the Ukrainian air force. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Reuters reports: “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” the statement quoted the Ukrainian president as saying, adding that he held a minute of silence for fallen troops. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. He did not specify which targets he meant. Images have emerged from the Russian missile attack this morning that struck a facility working on railway cars used for grain transport. A Russian general was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. Reuters reports: The report, published on the Telegram messaging app by state television reporter Alexander Sladkov, did not say precisely when and where Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. “The west must understand that its help cannot be a one-time thing, but something that continues until our victory,” she said. Earlier this week, the US announced that long-range weapons were being sent to Ukraine as part of a $700m (£560m) package that includes air-surveillance radar, additional Javelin short-range anti-tank rockets, artillery ammunition and helicopters. Russia has said the new military deliveries put Washington at risk of being directly involved in the conflict with Moscow. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said that the shortage of drinking water has reached a critical level. Petro Andrushenko said people had to register to get drinking water and could only get it every two days. Basic infrastructure and services like water, gas and electricity are yet to be restored to the city after the prolonged siege from Russian forces as they tried to take it over. According to CNN, Andrushenko said: “The amount of water was small before, but now it has decreased altogether. It is necessary to register in the queue ... In the future, the temperature will rise, the water level will fall, and the water will be less.” He said that water being provided is “very conditional drinking water”, which needs boiling. He added that he feared illnesses could break out in the south-eastern city because of the amount of rubbish and dead bodies buried in shallow graves. “We expect cholera [or] any viral epidemic related to the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of unsanitary conditions, this can happen. The worst thing is that such a basic thing as dysentery in the current conditions and with the dysfunctional medical system, lack of drugs, lack of laboratories and everything we are used to, lack of vaccines in Mariupol ... Even dysentery can kill tens of thousands.” Away from the conflict, but linked to the invasion, Ukraine are due to kick off against Wales shortly for the right to play at this year’s men’s football World Cup in Qatar. Their recent playoff game against Scotland, which was won by Ukraine was originally due to take place in March, but was delayed by the war. My colleague Will Unwin will be bringing you live updates with kick-off a few minutes away. Earlier today, in his weekly address from St Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Pope Francis called for “real negotiations” to end the “increasingly dangerous” war. “I renew my appeal to the leaders of nations: please do not lead humanity to destruction,” the 85-year-old said. US congress member Victoria Spartz has been on a two-day visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, being pictured with the governor of the region, Viacheslav Chaus. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the US started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the Russian state Tass news agency reported on Sunday. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over an important nuclear power plant. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, said Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister. Ukrainian police on Sunday shared video showing the aftermath of Russian shelling in the city of Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region. The video shows damaged administrative buildings, residential buildings and roads. Police said the headquarters for distributing humanitarian aid had been burned to the ground. They said more than 40 people had been living permanently in the building but no information on casualties was provided. Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw in Bakhmut have the following dispatch from Ukraine: In eastern Ukraine there was intense fighting on Sunday all across the Donbas frontline. Ukrainian forces deployed their existing Smersh multiple launcher rocket system near the city of Bakhmut. Sepia streaks were visible in the sky as rockers were fired at Russian army positions. Another - or possibly the same - Smersh system was seen on Sunday morning on the road between Slavyansk and Bakhmut. Ukrainian army sources admitted their Smersh MLRS were older than the modernised version used by Russia, and had a range of just 40kms. There was no evidence this weekend that the advanced MLRS promised by the Biden administration had reached the eastern theatre. Armoured personnel carriers, ammunition trucks and ambulances could be seen on the roads, as well as battered civilian vehicles painted in military green. There was also a spectacular 220mm 2S7 heavy artillery piece, nicknamed Godzilla. It was mounted on a long lorry.Doctors in Bakhmut’s military hospital said the battle for the Donbas had become a grinding artillery war, seven weeks after Vladimir Putin abandoned his attempt to seize Kyiv. Most of the soldiers brought in for treatment were suffering from shrapnel wounds, they said, with relatively few bullet injuries. Outgoing artillery could be heard near continuously, as well as the odd burst of unexplained gunfire. Most of the city’s 100,000 residents have fled. The city is 10km from the frontline. Denis Babenko, a pastor turned soldier, now evacuating civilians, said morale on the Ukrainian side was high. “We have soul but we don’t have the arms. They have the arms but no spirit or motivation. To win this war we need more heavy weapons.” Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. More soon... Columns of smoke rise over Kyiv after airstrikes early on Sunday. Missiles hit eastern areas of the Ukrainian capital and injured at least one person, according to the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko. Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes had targeted tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of the city. Ed Vulliamy has written a column about why he is supporting Ukraine in this year’s Fifa World Cup, despite his Welsh heritage. On Sunday evening, every football fan in the world – apart from the Welsh – will be joined by many others who do not even care for the game in rooting for the national team of battered and besieged but resilient Ukraine as they face Wales for a place in the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Watching here in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, even I, with a substantial quotient of Welsh DNA, will be wearing my official Ukraine yellow football shirt with “Malinovskyi 8” on the back. You can read the article here: Dan Sabbagh reports from Kyiv that Russia launched airstrikes into Kyiv for the first time in five weeks on Sunday, claiming it had destroyed western-supplied tanks – while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned more targets would be struck if weapons deliveries continued. Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week. If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets. Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury. You can read more of the reporting below: Russia’s strike on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has been the first attack in over a month on the city. Ukrainian officials have said that a counterattack in the east had retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk. Reuters reports: Dark smoke could be seen from many miles away after the attack on two outlying districts of Kyiv. Moscow said it had hit a repair shop housing tanks sent from eastern Europe. Ukraine said Russia had carried out the strike using long-range air-launched missiles fired from heavy bombers as far away as the Caspian Sea – a weapon far more valuable than the tanks Russia claimed to have hit. At least one person was hospitalised but there were no immediate reports of deaths from the strike - a sudden reminder of war in a capital where normal life has largely returned since Russian forces were driven from its outskirts in March. “The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal - kill as many as possible,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak wrote in a tweet. Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said a Russian cruise missile had flown “critically low” over the country’s second largest nuclear power plant. The attack was the first big strike on Kyiv since late April, when a missile killed a journalist. Recent weeks have seen Russia focus its destructive might mainly on frontlines in the east and south, although Moscow occasionally strikes elsewhere in what it calls a campaign to degrade Ukraine’s military infrastructure and block Western arms shipments. Matthew Cantor has spoken to Lee Zion, a journalist in Minnesota who plans to fly to Europe to help Ukrainians “in any way he can”. Lee Zion is preparing to head to Ukraine this summer. “I have gotten all my shots. I have started putting personal possessions into storage, giving other things away. I’ve adopted out two cats,” he said. “And minor things – I’m trying to learn the language. I can at least communicate some basic needs. Like ‘me want cookie,’” he said. For four years, Zion has worked seven days a week at a small-town Minnesota newspaper. But now, disgusted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he plans to fly to Europe and help the Ukrainians in any way he can.

Nato’s reluctance to seize the initiative, rather than passively reacting to Russian actions, is unfathomable, too. Proposals for a no-fly zone and safe havens in western Ukraine are repeatedly rejected as too risky. So dare to try something else! Nato has the muscle and means. It could do much more to stop the systematic killing of civilians and push Russia back, as previously argued here. Left to fight alone, Zelenskiy pleads for heavy weapons but his pleas still often go unmet or responses are delayed. “We need to get serious about supplying [Ukraine’s] army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield,” says US Gen Philip Breedlove, formerly Nato commander in Europe. He’s right. You can read more here: Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry’s statement came after the Ukrainian capital experienced by several explosions early on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. The mayor, Vitaly Klitschko said at least one person was taken to hospital; no deaths were immediately reported. Reuters reports: Dark smoke rose into the sky above the Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts where the explosions rang out. The missiles were the first to hit the capital since late April when a Radio Liberty producer was killed when a Russian missile hit the building she lived in. According to preliminary data, Russia launched missiles from Tu-95 aircraft from the Caspian Sea,” the Ukrainian air forces said in a statement. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on the west to impose more sanctions on Russia to punish it for the strikes and to supply more weapons to Ukraine. The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal: kill as many as possible,” he wrote. The mayor of the historic town of Brovary some 12 miles (12km) from Kyiv’s centre, urged people to remain inside their houses as there had been reports of the smell of soot coming from the smoke. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the United States started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the TASS news agency reported on Sunday. The TASS news agency reports: Putin said that if such missiles are supplied, that Russia will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, in an Rossiya-1 state television channel Putin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue if western countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He said the “fuss” around western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict. Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 and M142 HIMARS to strike troops and weapons stockpiles at the Russian forces’ rear. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. “There are discussions with the United Arab Emirates. We have to find an alternative to Russian oil,” Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over a major nuclear power plant. Reuters, although they could not immediately verify the claim, reports: “It’s probable that was the missile that was fired in the direction of Kyiv,” the operator of the Pivdennoukrainska plant, also called the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Early on Sunday, several explosions rocked Kyiv. Pivdennoukrainska is Ukraine’s second largest nuclear plant located near in the Mykolaiv region, about 350 km (220 miles) south of Kyiv. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Those figures are not final, the parliament said on Telegram: Work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories. The true number is likely significantly higher. In parts of Ukraine that are occupied or under active attack by Russia, local authorities have said it is impossible to clear bodies from the street, or count the numbers of citizens killed or injured. The parliament said 1938 schools or educational facilities had been damaged by bombing, and 182 were completely destroyed. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Reuters reports that Gaidai said on Ukrainian television: It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back.” “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” Reuters could not immediately verify Gaidai’s claims. If you’d like a fuller report on fight for territory in Sievierodonetsk, here’s a report from our Ukraine-based correspondents: For a little more context on these strikes in Kyiv, they come after a period of relative calm in the city, after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south. Politico’s Ukraine-based correspondent Christopher Miller said “It was eerily silent this morn, save for the birds. Then came the explosions in the distance.” He called it “the first attack on Kyiv in weeks”. An update on the explosions that shook Kyiv in the early hours of this morning - Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said that so far there have been no deaths reported. The mayor said on Telegram on Sunday morning: Friends! Regarding the morning explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. There are currently no casualties from missile strikes on infrastructure. One victim was hospitalized. Services are still working in the affected areas This morning, Kyiv Regional Military Administration said that as well as the missiles that hit, one “enemy missile was shot down over Obukhiv district by air defense forces”. It asked residents to remain in shelters during air raids. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. The intelligence report backs up claims by Ukrainian officials on Saturday that their forces had recaptured parts of the city. The MoD said on Sunday morning: Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have counterattacked in the contested city of Sieverodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower. Several explosions shook the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. “Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,” Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Services are already working on site. More detailed information - later.” A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. Air raid sirens had gone off earlier across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up, or just dropping in to find the latest information, here’s a summary of the main points of the past few hours. Powerful explosions were heard early on Sunday in Kyiv, a Reuters witness said. Smoke was seen in the Ukrainian capital following the explosions. Earlier, air raid sirens were going off across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Sievierodonetsk despite Moscow “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, the Luhansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said the Russian army has taken control over most of Sievierodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. But the Russian army claimed some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from Sievierodonetsk. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Sievierodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk”, Sievierodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow’s anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts”, in an interview that aired on Saturday. According to Reuters, Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen. Kyiv has rebuked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for saying it was important not to “humiliate Russia”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response: “Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. A EU decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened”, said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with hundreds of captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced. “Those responsible for war crimes – including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them – must face justice,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There were reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack . The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolise the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reported.",

                    "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should intervene urgently to start insulating British homes and introduce fiscal policies to reduce bills, as further delay will mean more people face “extreme suffering” this winter as energy bills soar, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned. David King said: “This could be the worst possible time for the leadership of this country to be simply sitting back. We’re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this – and that is missing.” Johnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that had no conclusive outcome, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month. King told the Guardian: “He is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.” He called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a bonanza, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. “They are taking bigger and bigger profits, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,” he said. King – a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government’s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson – said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act. Waiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. “There will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,” King warned. “We need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.” He said home insulation must also be a priority. “Insulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.” Even starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: “It’s never too late – if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK’s home insulation problem, while calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current £1.971, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday. King was scathing of the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss’s emphasis on tax cuts to tackle with the cost of living crisis, though she has also hinted further support could not be ruled out. Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. “The big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,” he said. King also criticised the government for turning to increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades. “It’s completely the wrong timescale – it will take 10 or 20 years for new oil and gas projects [started now] to come online,” he warned. The Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will publish a report this week arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages. International cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession. “The remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO2 simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,” the report says. “A fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.” Critics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent – but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem. “Offshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,” he added.

He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of reviving its coal-fired power stations. “I worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,” in the UK and other countries, King said. Ministers had delayed again a decision on a potential new coalmine in Cumbria, which King warned could be approved by the next prime minister on the “excuse” of energy security. In the US, important climate legislation was passed last week that will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to key technologies, but owing to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby it still contains sops to gas and oil production. “The power of the fossil-fuel lobby has been such that the US has never been able to play a leading role in negotiations on the climate,” King said.",

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. Russia has increased the intensity of its eastern offensive but has been repeatedly repelled by Ukrainian forces, the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said, as western governments pledged to send more artillery, and a new deadline for surrender in Mariupol approached. The MoD said late on Tuesday that shelling and strikes were increasing over the line of control in Donbas but that Russian forces continued to be hampered by logistical and technological problems. It also noted an “inability to stamp out resistance” in Mariupol as a sign of failure to achieve Moscow’s objectives. The Russian defence ministry has said it will offer the besieged port city a ceasefire today to allow Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms. About 1,000 civilians are reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath the steel plant in Mariupol, according to the city council. Most of the civilians are believed to be women with children and elderly people. How are Ukrainian troops faring in Mariupol? A commander for the Ukrainian marines in Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction, in a Facebook post published early this morning. What is happening with the diplomatic effort? Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, is planning to avoid sessions attended by Russian officials. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 56 of the invasion. January 6 ‘was a coup organized by the president’, says Jamie Raskin Donald Trump attempted a coup on 6 January 2021 as he tried to salvage his doomed presidency, and that will be a central focus of forthcoming public hearings of the special House panel investigating events surrounding the insurrection at the US Capitol, the congressman Jamie Raskin has said. Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. What else did Raskin say? “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan.” Texas advocates file new legal challenge to near total abortion ban Reproductive rights advocates in Texas have filed a new legal challenge to halt a near total abortion ban that has been in effect for more than half a year. Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically as early as six week of pregnancy, which is before most people are aware they are pregnant – and offers no exception for rape or incest. The lawsuit, filed yesterday, asks a federal court to rule the extreme law unconstitutional. It cites public threats and legal action from anti-abortion activists against Texas abortion funds, groups that have been instrumental in helping patients travel out of state for care, arguing that this conduct has chilled their first amendment rights. “Plaintiffs urgently need this court to stop Texas’s brazen defiance of the rule of law, uphold the federal constitutional rights of pregnant Texans, and restore the ability of abortion funds and their donors, employees and volunteers to fully serve Texas abortion patients,” the federal court filing reads. Wendy Davis, a former Texas senator who famously led an 11-hour filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in 2013, said: “We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming SB 8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats.” In other news … Prince Harry has said the Queen was “on great form” during their recent meeting, and he wanted to make sure she had “the right people around her”. Speaking to NBC about his meeting with the monarch, Harry said: “Being with her it was great, it was just so nice to see her, she’s on great form.” In a 59-page opinion on Monday, the US district judge Kathryn Mizelle of Tampa, Florida, overturned the federal requirement that people wear masks on planes and public transportation. She has become an instant heroine of the Republican right hailed for “courage” and “common sense”. The Fantastic Beasts star Ezra Miller has been arrested on suspicion of assault in Hawaii. Miller already faces charges of harassment and disorderly conduct after an incident last month at a karaoke bar on the island. A growing number of cities and states have restricted the information that local law enforcement departments can exchange with immigration authorities. But new documents reveal that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tapped private technology companies to skirt such sanctuary policies. Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years at the start of the year and said it expects to lose even more in the spring, sending its share price crashing again yesterday. The streaming giant’s share price initially fell close to 20% on news that it had lost 200,000 subscribers globally during the first quarter. Stat of the day: most workers at large retail and food firms get less than $15 an hour – study Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many staff still make less than $10 an hour, according to a company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project.

Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnieper River to evacuate. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. The west should consider how to address Russia’s need for security guarantees if Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said. He said Europe needed to address Putin’s fear that “NATO comes right up to its doors”, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia, as Europe prepares its future security architecture, Reuters reports. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service said. The Ukrainian army has recaptured 13 settlements in the Luhansk region, the eastern-most oblast in the country, according to the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai. He said that artillery was still being fired at the villages by Russian forces. Doctors are due to visit next week and firewood is being organised for residents, Haidai posted on Telegram. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British ministry of defence. The price cap on Russian seaborne oil has been adopted by the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 a barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation, PEN. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. Around mid-October, almost a month after Vladimir Putin called for the partial mobilisation of Russian citizens to fight the war in Ukraine, there was a knock at the door of the Moscow flat that is registered as my official residence in the country. The family friends who reside there opened the door and were greeted by two officers from the Russian military administration, who asked them whether I was at home. They said I had not been home in more than 20 years. The mobilisation was declared by Putin on the 21 September, after half a year of strategic failures, senseless deaths and humanitarian atrocities at the hands of the Russian army in Ukraine. There are an estimated 356,520 Russian casualties to date, close to 40% of the entire Russian armed forces. The west should consider how to address Russia’s need for security guarantees if Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in remarks broadcast on Saturday. Macron said Europe needed to address Putin’s fear that “NATO comes right up to its doors” and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia as Europe prepares its future security architecture, Reuters reports. Russia has rejected a price cap on its oil after the Group of Seven nations plus Australia joined the EU in adopting a $60-a-barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow “will not accept this cap”, according to the RIA news agency. He said Russia would conduct a rapid analysis of the agreement and then respond. Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, warned the cap’s European backers would regret their decision. “From this year, Europe will live without Russian oil,” Ulyanov tweeted. “Moscow has already made it clear that it will not supply oil to those countries that support anti-market price caps. Wait, very soon the EU will accuse Russia of using oil as a weapon.” Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spinu, has announced an energy deal he said would reduce the risk of large-scale electricity outages. Spinu said state utilities firm Energocom would buy enough electricity from Cuciurgan, the country’s largest power station, to cover all of Moldova’s needs for December when combined with existing imports from Romania, Reuters reports. Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has suffered from widespread power outages amid a reduced flow of natural gas from Russia and Kremlin air strikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine. The power station, located in Transnistria, a breakaway territory loyal to Moscow, depends on Russian gas dispensed by the Moldovan government in Chișinău. The Cuciurgan station had stopped providing electricity to the rest of Moldova after Russian state energy giant cut flows by 40%. Moldova has since relied on more expensive Romanian electricity but has still suffered blackouts linked to Russian strikes on Ukraine. Spinu said the power station, which sits across the Dniester River, would receive 5.7m cubic meters of gas a day in exchange for selling electricity for $73 a megawatt per hour. “This contract is a reasonable compromise to ensure the citizens on both banks of the Dniester [have] electricity and gas,” Spinu wrote on his Telegram channel. After Britain’s National Crime Agency arrested a “wealthy Russian businessman” on suspicion of money laundering and other offences, the Russian embassy in London has demanded information from the UK’s Foreign Office on the reasons and circumstances of the detention of the unidentified businessman and the conditions in which he is being held, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, the authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. “A group of people tried to steal a Banksy mural. They cut out the work from the wall of a house destroyed by the Russians,” the Kyiv governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said in a post on Telegram. He attached the image of a gaping hole in the wall where the image once stood. Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, announced an energy deal on Saturday he said would reduce the risk of “massive electricity outages” in the former Soviet republic, Reuters reports. Moldova has had widespread power outages amid Russian airstrikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine and a reduced flow of natural gas from Russian state energy giant Gazprom. The Ukrainian army has recaptured 13 settlements in the Luhansk region, the eastern most oblast in the country, according to the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai. He said that artillery was still being fired at the villages by Russian forces. Doctors are due to visit next week and firewood is being organised for residents, Haidai posted on Telegram. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has landed in Belarus’ capital, Minsk, to meet his opposite number Viktor Khrenin. Belarus is one of Russia’s closest allies, and was used as a launchpad for the invasion in February. As it approaches 5pm in Kyiv, here’s a roundup of today’s news so far. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages, including animal parts, in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service has said. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The price cap on Russian seabourne oil has been expanded to the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 a barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. The news was announced by deputy head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko on Telegram. He said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. The river been the front line between Ukrainian and Russian troops in the area since Russia pulled out of the city itself. Shelling towards the city has continued since then. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has responded to the price cap imposed by the G7 and its allies on the exportation of seabound crude oil from Russia. Peskov said the Kremlin was prepared for the price cap and was analysing it. “We will not accept this ceiling,” the Tass news agency quoted him as saying. He added that the analysis would be carried out quickly and Russia would then say how it would respond. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. A Russian businessman has been arrested in London by officers investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs. The 58-year-old man, who has not been named, was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on Thursday on suspicion of offences including money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury. A 35-year-old man, who works at the residence, was arrested nearby on suspicion of money laundering and obstruction of an officer after he was seen leaving with a bag containing thousands of pounds in cash. A third man, 39, who is the former boyfriend of the businessman’s current partner, was arrested at his home in Pimlico, London, for offences including money laundering and conspiracy to defraud. They have all been bailed, according to PA Media. Graeme Biggar, director general of the NCA, said: “The NCA’s combatting kleptocracy cell, only established this year, is having significant success investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs, the professional service providers that support and enable them and those linked to the Russian regime. “We will continue to use all the powers and tactics available to us to disrupt this threat.” The NCA said it is the latest operation carried out as part of its efforts to disrupt the activities of corrupt international business figures and their enablers. A statement said the NCA has already helped with the freezing of numerous properties, eight yachts and four aircraft. The graphic below shows the latest developments in Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Friday, it was reported that Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday. You can read Isobel Koshiw’s report here for more in-depth reporting regarding the price cap of Russian oil. “G7 countries and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne oil, with the aim of reducing Moscow’s income and limiting its ability to finance its war in Ukraine. But critics, including Ukraine, say the cap of $60 a barrel is still higher than the current market price for Russian crude oil and is unlikely to affect the KremlinRussia’s war coffers. In a statement on the deal, the UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described the country’s support for Ukraine as unwavering and said it would “continue to look for new ways to clamp down on [the Russian president, Vladimir] Putin’s funding streams wherever we can”. The cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea is designed to affect the country’s exports worldwide, in addition to the EU-wide embargo on Russian crude oil, which comes into force on 5 December, which the UK is also adopting. Andrey Kurkov has written an opinion piece, arguing that Ukrainians enjoying the festive season and a local chess championship is an “act of defiance for our country’s future”. “While Ukraine lives in fear of the next mass bombing of its energy infrastructure by Russian missiles and Iranian drones, and constantly monitors the actions of troops located in Belarus, there are still small forms of normalcy, small forms of resistance. A blitz chess championship was recently held in Zhytomyr, a city 140km west of Kyiv and a regular target of missile attacks. “Blitz chess – because slow chess is impossible in today’s Ukraine, where everything has to be done quickly or very quickly. The games were played according to the Swiss system, and with nine rounds in which players have only three minutes a move. If in peacetime a person appreciates every hour of tranquility, during a war we appreciate every minute.” You can read the full article here: The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that 17 Ukrainian embassies or diplomatic missions around the world have received letter bombs or packages containing animal parts, including cows eyes, in recent days. In an interview with CNN, he said: “It started with an explosion at the embassy of Ukraine in Spain,” Kuleba said. “But what followed this explosion was more weird, and I would even say sick.” A letter bomb at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid left a staff member with minor injuries on Wednesday. Others have been sent to the Spanish prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the US embassy. Ukraine’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said that embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Italy and Austria are among those to receive the packages. When asked who he thought was behind the letters, Kuleba told CNN said: “I feel tempted to say, to name Russia straight away, because first of all you have to answer the question, who benefits? “Maybe this terror response is the Russian answer to the diplomatic horror that we created for Russia on the international arena, and this is how they try to fight back while they are losing the real diplomatic battles one after another.” Russia has denied any responsibility for the packages in Madrid. On Wednesday, its embassy in Spain said: “Any terrorist threat or act, even more so directed against a diplomatic mission, is totally reprehensible.” More details have been published about attacks on Ukraine on Friday, in an update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. They said Russia continues to shell civilian infrastructure and is trying to go on the offensive in Avdiivka and Bakhmut. Russia launched five missile strikes, 27 airstrikes and 44 rocket launcher attacks on Ukrainian towns, cities and troops. The main target for Russian airstrikes was Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both in Donetsk oblast in the east of Ukraine. Kherson city has continued to be shelled since its recapture by Ukrainian troops. Two Russian missiles hit the region of Zaporizhzhia in the south-east of Ukraine overnight. The governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said they had damaged buildings near the regional capital, Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. Spain has sent its first Hawk air-defence missile system to Ukraine. The American-built Raytheon system can be used against aircraft and missiles, both of which have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine, including power stations and homes. Spain has promised to supply six units to Ukraine. Russia has said it will continue to find buyers for oil, despite a price cap for seabourne oil being set at $60 a barrel. A group of western countries, including EU nations, G7 countries and Australia have agreed the cap as they try to limit Moscow’s income and its ability to finance its ongoing war in Ukraine. In retaliation, Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials have said that they won’t sell oil to countries that implement it. Russia’s embassy to the US on Saturday said that the policy was “reshaping” the free market, and insisted oil would continue to be sold. In a post on Telegram, it said: “Steps like these will inevitably result in increasing uncertainty and imposing higher costs for raw materials’ consumers. “Regardless of the current flirtations with the dangerous and illegitimate instrument, we are confident that Russian oil will continue to be in demand.” Ukrainian forces killed another 510 Russian troops on Friday, bringing the total number of soldiers lost by Russia since the invasion to 90,600. They also downed another eight drones and managed to take out a tank, according to statistics provided by the Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces. A total of 7,042 explosive items have been “removed and neutralised” from Kherson oblast, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. Work to rid the area of mines and other traps has been going on since the Russian retreat from the city last month. Ukrainian emergency workers say they have surveyed almost 700ha of open territory, 60km of railway tracks and 326 households. Authorities are urging anyone who returns to Kherson or the area around it to be extremely careful. Last month, the Guardian reported that ridding Kherson of mines could take years. Here’s a bit more detail about the oil price cap instituted by the G7 and its allies. The EU had already agreed on an embargo of seaborne crude oil from Russia in a package of sanctions announced earlier this year. The G7 and Australia agreement will allow non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil using western insurance and maritime services as long as they do not pay more a barrel than the agreed limit. Because the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. A senior US Treasury Department official told reporters on Friday that the $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil will keep global markets well supplied while “institutionalising” discounts created by the threat of such a limit. Under the terms of the deal the price cap will be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that. It also includes a mechanism that would keep the price cap at least 5% below the market rate. Security experts from the CSIS thinktank have warned a cap at $60 is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. It has been estimated that Russian oil is sold at a profit from $40-$45 a barrel, but Russia’s true extraction costs are hard to estimate. The UK Ministry of Defence has released an update on Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine. Russian forces continue to invest a large part of their overall firepower on an approximately 15km-long sector of entrenched frontline around the Donetsk oblast town of Bakhmut, the defence ministry says. In recent days, Russia has likely made small advances on the southern axis of this assault and is likely to be planning to encircle the town. Russia has prioritised Bakhmut as its main offensive effort since early August 2022. The capture of the town would have limited operational value although it would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The statement from the ministry adds that the campaign has been disproportionately costly, relative to these possible gains. There is a realistic possibility that Bakhmut’s capture has become primarily a symbolic, political objective for Russia. The G7 and Australia have agreed to cap the price paid for Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, hours after EU members overcame internal resistance to reach the same decision earlier in the day. The EU agreed the price after holdout Poland gave its support, paving the way for formal approval over the weekend. In a statement, the Group of Seven leading economies and Australia said the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon after. The price cap aims to reduce Russia’s income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude oil takes effect on 5 December. Poland had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible in order to squeeze Russian revenues and limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The final deal includes a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5% below the market rate. US officials said the deal was unprecedented and demonstrated the resolve of the coalition opposing Russia’s war. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the price cap would significantly reduce Russia’s revenues. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Jonathan Yerushalmy and I’ll be with you for the next while. The G7, EU and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, in a move that could result in Russian oil output falling by 500,000 barrels a day by early 2023. The decision by the Group of Seven nations and Australia followed an earlier announcement from the EU that the bloc had overcome internal resistance to a $60 a barrel price. The G7 and Australia said in a statement the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon thereafter. More on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: The US president, Joe Biden, said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, if he was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN.

Surovikin admitted that the situation in Kherson was “not easy”. “Further actions and plans regarding the city of Kherson will depend on the developing military-tactical situation, which is not easy. We will act consciously, in a timely manner, without ruling out difficult decisions,” he added. The comments appeared to mark a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties facing Russian forces. But it was not immediately clear whether Surovikin, the ruthless general now in charge of the war, was hinting at a looming Russian withdrawal from Kherson or a fresh round of airstrikes. Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank, was one of the first cities to fall to Russia after the invasion on 24 February and is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s government. Gruelling fighting has been reported in the region since the start of Ukraine’s counter-offensive at the end of the summer, with both sides suffering steep casualties. The Ukrainian army has sought to pinch off Russian supply lines to Kherson by destroying the two main road bridges across the Dnipro. Kyiv has recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, leading to speculations that it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. “I am guessing in the next 48-72 hours they might tell us what is happening,” he added. Shortly after Surovikin’s statements, the Russian-installed head of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said in a video address that people in four towns in the Kherson region were being moved, in anticipation of a “large-scale offensive”. Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday. “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities,” he said. Since Surovikin’s appointment on 8 October, Moscow has unleashed a barrage of cruise missiles and “kamikaze” drones targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure as well as the civilian population. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that Moscow’s use of Iranian-made drones was a symbol of the Kremlin’s “military and political bankruptcy”. “The very fact of Russia’s appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin’s recognition of its military and political bankruptcy,” Zelenskiy said in his daily address on Tuesday. “For decades, they spent billions of dollars on their own military industrial complex. And in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles.” But, Zelenskiy added, “strategically, it will not help them anyway. It only further proves to the world that Russia is on the path of defeat and is trying to draw someone else into its accomplices in terror.” The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 Iranian drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the US House of Representatives, warned on Tuesday that Congress would not “write a blank cheque to Ukraine” if his party wins next month’s midterm elections. Hours later, however, another senior Republican, Michael McCaul, said that he thought that the Ukrainians should “get what they need” – including longer-range missiles than those the Biden administration has so far been prepared to supply. Analysts say the mixed messages reflect an internal debate between traditional national security conservatives and the Trumpist wing of the party, where pro-Russian sentiment is much stronger.",

                    "bodyText": "The Environment Agency has told the Chinese nuclear developer behind plans to build a new reactor in Essex that it must resolve at least six safety issues before it can move forward. The issues identified by the environment watchdog in its early assessments of the plans for the site at Bradwell-on-Sea include concerns over how China General Nuclear Group (CGN) will dispose of radioactive waste. The agency has opened a consultation calling for views on its assessment and there is likely to be strong criticism from environmentalists and local community groups who oppose the new plant. CGN is helping to build the first new nuclear power plants in the UK in a generation as a junior partner at EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C site in Somerset and at EDF’s planned plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk, both of which will use a reactor type designed by the French energy company. The Chinese state-owned company also plans to build a nuclear power plant using its own reactor design, the UK Hualong pressurised water reactor, at Bradwell. It hopes to have the design approved by UK authorities by 2022. The plans have raised concerns among those who believe that Chinese-owned companies should not be involved in the UK’s critical national infrastructure over security and surveillance concerns following the Huawei controversy. Alan McGoff, of the Environment Agency (EA), said he expects CGN to resolve the potential issues identified by the agency “over the next year or so”, but warned that the agency will accept the reactor design “only if we are satisfied that all the issues have been addressed”. The EA has been scrutinising the plans since 2017 and has also identified concerns over how CGN plans to use its operational experience “to inform and improve the design”, its plans to respond to safety and environment protection assessments, and its use of high-efficiency particulate air filters. “If the issues are not resolved or new issues are identified but not resolved, then we would consider only issuing an interim statement of design acceptability. Our aim is to complete our detailed assessment of the design in early 2022,” McGoff said. • This article was amended on 13 January 2021 to clarify the location of the nuclear site at Bradwell-on-Sea.",

In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. </strong>Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south?page=with:block-63870e2b8f082ef70a2419f3#block-63870e2b8f082ef70a2419f3\">see 8.19 GMT</a>). Behind each proposal, questions remain.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. </strong>Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. </strong>James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. </strong>The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. </strong>Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen.</strong> In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1597857662753902592\">video statement</a>, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. </strong>Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security Service of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. </strong>In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom.</strong> The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities.</p></li> <li><p><strong>One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. </strong>Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on <a href=\"https://t.me/starukhofficial/3984\">Telegram</a> early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished.</strong> There were no injuries or casualties.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880.</strong> The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces.</strong> In an early morning bulletin from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. </strong>Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. </strong>He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York City. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. </strong>The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, <a href=\"https://t.me/tymoshenko_kyrylo/2936\">posted on Telegram</a> that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured.</strong> The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems.</strong> Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning.</strong> They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents.</strong> Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets.</strong> Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money.</p></li> </ul> <p>That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the live blog for today.

If it did, said Gavrysh, then Ukraine would accept her proposal. </p> <p>A special tribunal for the crime of aggression has been the subject of a months-long campaign by Kyiv. It would lead to Russia’s top figures prosecuted, including Putin and the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and would require little investigation as the fact that the crime of aggression was committed was something overwhelmingly accepted by the UN general assembly.

Behind each proposal, questions remain.</p> <p>On the special tribunal, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>… while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court, backed by the United Nations, to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU wants a specialised court, because Russia has not signed the ICC treaty, leaving the court without jurisdiction over “crimes of aggression”. The ICC can only judge specific war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.</p> <p>EU officials are certain that Russia, a permanent member of the UN security council, will block any move to create a specialised court. Nevertheless they intend to table a resolution to the security council and when it is shot down, seek support from the general assembly of all UN members. One EU official said they expected “good enough numbers” to support the proposal.</p> <p>Uncertainties also surround the proposed money for Ukraine.</p> <p>Von der Leyen said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money.</p> <p>In the short term, we could create, with our partners, a structure to manage these funds and invest them. We would then use the proceeds for Ukraine.</p> </blockquote> <p>But officials do not yet know much the proceeds could be worth. For legal reasons they believe they can use only the proceeds generated from managing the assets to aid Ukraine, rather than the assets themselves.</p> <p>Eventually the funds would have to be returned to their owners, although the commission proposes to offset the Russian central bank’s €300bn against any future reparations to Ukraine, made as the result of a peace agreement. But buy-in from other western allies is not yet clear.</p> <p>Both ideas will be presented to a G7 taskforce next month.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-30T17:16:29.275Z\">at 5.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-63877b288f08f5eb2e3145a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-30T15:50:24.183Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some more on that blast at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid, Spain, now from the Reuters news agency.</strong></p> <p>It reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad.</p> <p>The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid.</p> <p>In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said.</p> <p>The minister also urged Spain to “take urgent measures to investigate the attack”, the spokesperson added.

                    "bodyText": "The time in Kyiv is 8.45pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top headlines: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York City. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the live blog for today. Thanks following along. I’ll be back in the morning with more up-to-the-minute news of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Murayev’s political party and a television channel under his control were seen as vehicles for Kremlin interests in Ukraine before Moscow’s invasion, Reuters reported. The party, Nashi, was banned after Russian forces swept into Ukraine. He had promoted views that aligned with Russian narratives on Ukraine, including that the 2014 Maidan protests in Kyiv were a western-backed coup and the Kremlin-fuelled war in eastern Ukraine that followed was an internal conflict. Weeks before Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine this year, Britain’s foreign ministry said Russia was considering installing Murayev to lead a new puppet government, a claim denied both by him and by Moscow. The SBU said an independent analysis of Murayev’s public statements “testify to the presence in his actions of signs” of treason. It said the materials seized in Wednesday’s searches would be examined further. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. “Only in the last day there were 131 fires in Ukraine, 106 of them in the residential sector. Nine people died, eight were injured,” the emergency service said. “Generators on balconies, gas cylinders in apartments, lit candles ... Due to violations of fire safety rules, the use of uncertified products for heating and cooking, incidents of fires and explosions in high-rise and private buildings have become more frequent.” The service urged Ukrainians to take more care in their homes and to explain fire risks to children. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. The Russian officials join more than 1,000 others, including 120 the UK has sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine in February, including Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, and Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea FC. Cleverly said: “The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. “Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. “The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence.” Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. Arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday, Welby said: “The people of Ukraine have shown extraordinary courage in the face of Russia’s illegal, unjust and brutal invasion. This visit is about showing solidarity with them as they face a profoundly difficult winter. “I look forward to meeting with church leaders and local Christians in Kyiv, and learning how we can continue to support them amid the ongoing devastation, loss and destruction of this war. “I urge Christians in the Church of England and around the world to keep praying for the people of Ukraine in this Advent season – along with all people caught up in conflicts around the world – and offering our solidarity and support in every way we can.” The president of the European Commission appears to have caused some confusion on Wednesday in her speech on Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian military personnel had died as well as 20,000 civilians. Ukraine has been tight-lipped about its wartime military losses, saying figures would give Russia an advantage. The commission later apologised, saying the speech was inaccurate and the estimate had included injured as well as dead. The sentence was then removed from the transcript on the commission’s website and edited from the video of her speech. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff told Ukrainian journalists that it would not comment on the figure quoted but vowed that Russia would face punishment for its actions in Ukraine. Von der Leyen also said the EU would set up a special tribunal for the “crime of aggression” – in other words Russia’s military transgressing Ukraine’s borders. The statement appears to have caught Ukraine off guard. Oleh Gavrysh, a spokesperson of Andriy Smyrnov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the effort to establish a tribunal, said they were “exploring” what Von der Leyen had said and needed to confirm if this tribunal would include removing the immunity of key Russian leaders, including the Russian president Vladimir Putin. If it did, said Gavrysh, then Ukraine would accept her proposal. A special tribunal for the crime of aggression has been the subject of a months-long campaign by Kyiv. It would lead to Russia’s top figures prosecuted, including Putin and the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and would require little investigation as the fact that the crime of aggression was committed was something overwhelmingly accepted by the UN general assembly. But states will need to back the tribunal individually as they will be responsible for enforcing any sentencing of Russia’s leaders as international criminals (even if in absentia). The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. On the special tribunal, she said: … while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court, backed by the United Nations, to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. The EU wants a specialised court, because Russia has not signed the ICC treaty, leaving the court without jurisdiction over “crimes of aggression”. The ICC can only judge specific war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. EU officials are certain that Russia, a permanent member of the UN security council, will block any move to create a specialised court. Nevertheless they intend to table a resolution to the security council and when it is shot down, seek support from the general assembly of all UN members. One EU official said they expected “good enough numbers” to support the proposal. Uncertainties also surround the proposed money for Ukraine. Von der Leyen said: We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. In the short term, we could create, with our partners, a structure to manage these funds and invest them. We would then use the proceeds for Ukraine. But officials do not yet know much the proceeds could be worth. For legal reasons they believe they can use only the proceeds generated from managing the assets to aid Ukraine, rather than the assets themselves. Eventually the funds would have to be returned to their owners, although the commission proposes to offset the Russian central bank’s €300bn against any future reparations to Ukraine, made as the result of a peace agreement. But buy-in from other western allies is not yet clear. Both ideas will be presented to a G7 taskforce next month. Some more on that blast at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid, Spain, now from the Reuters news agency. It reports: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The minister also urged Spain to “take urgent measures to investigate the attack”, the spokesperson added. The perpetrators, he added, “will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work on strengthening Ukraine and countering Russian aggression”. Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago. The letter, which arrived by ordinary mail and was not scanned, caused “a very small wound on the ring finger of the right hand” of the employee after he opened it in the garden of the embassy, Gonzalez said. It was addressed to ambassador Serhii Pohoreltsev, she said. Detectives were probing the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators, Spanish police said. Spain’s High Court will lead the investigation. An officer at the embassy declined to comment. Correos, the Spanish state-run postal company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the origin of the letter. The residential area surrounding the embassy in northwestern Madrid was cordoned off and a bomb disposal unit was deployed to the scene. Reuters footage showed scores of police officers, armed with assault rifles and blocking roads with vans, in the neighbourhood around the embassy. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York city. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. Lavrov also said the West was pushing Ukraine to continue fighting against Russia. “It is necessary to avoid any military clash between nuclear powers, even with the use of conventional weapons. The escalation may become uncontrollable,” TASS quoted Lavrov as saying. Putin has issued a series of thinly veiled nuclear threats during the course of the war in Ukraine, but several top officials have repeatedly denied Moscow plans to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and have accused the West of upping the nuclear ante. The UK has imposed sanctions on another 22 Russians who it says have been behind the further mobilisation of troops in Ukraine. Among them is the Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, who oversees the Russian weapons industry and is responsible for arming soldiers. Arkady Gostev, the director of the Russian prison service, is also on the list because of his support for the Wagner Group’s recruitment of inmates for the war effort. A total of 10 governors and regional heads have been hit with sanctions, including those in charge of Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kalmykia, from where a number of conscripts have been called up. Another 29 regional governors were already placed under sanctions in July for providing financial support to Russian proxy administrations in Ukraine. Others include Ella Pamfilova and Andrey Burov, who helped organised referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine, which Vladimir Putin used as a basis to annex the regions in September. Those under sanctions are subject to asset freezes, travel bans and transport sanctions. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence. The full list of those hit with sanctions by the British government can be found here. Nine people have died in fires in Ukraine over the last 24 hours, according to the authorities, as Russian attacks on power infrastructure has caused people to resort to using emergency generators and gas cylinders. Ukraine’s state emergency services said there had been more than 130 fires in the last day. It said eight people had been injured. The blackouts have led to a surge in accidents “due to the violation of fire safety rules”, the service said. The number of fires and explosions in high-rise and private houses has increased, Agency France-Presse reports. In a press conference on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure as “barbaric”. “Over the past several weeks, Russia has bombed out more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system, plunging millions in the cold,” Blinken said after a meeting with Nato counterparts in Bucharest. As we are less than three weeks from Christmas, the sight of trees being erected in city squares around the world is commonplace. It will be no different in Kyiv despite the ongoing conflict. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a 12-metre artificial tree would go up as a “symbolic Christmas tree of indomitability”. The tree in Sofia Square will be decorated with “energy-saving” garlands that will be powered by a generator, he said in a Telegram post. After Christmas, the generator will be donated to the military. There will also be phone charging points set up nearby. Atop the festive structure will be Ukraine’s coat of arms, and around its base will be flags of countries that have helped Ukraine. Germany has said it will have trained 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers by the summer of 2023. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also told the Berlin security conference that Germany understood the importance of supplying weapons to Ukraine, and working with others to support the government in Kyiv. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Russian forces pulled back from northern Ukraine weeks after its invasion but have continued shelling some areas, Ukrainian officials have said. Spanish police said an employee at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid was injured on Wednesday in an explosion that occurred while he was handling a letter. The staff member received light injuries and went to hospital under his own steam, police said. Detectives are investigating the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators. Ukraine’s embassy to Spain was not immediately reachable, Reuters reported. The area surrounding the embassy has been cordoned off, the state broadcaster TVE reported. Vladimir Putin has focused his “fire and ire” on Ukraine’s civilian population, bombing more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system – water and electricity supply – in a strategy that will not work, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday. “These are President Putin’s new targets. He’s hitting them hard,” Blinken said after a Nato meeting in Bucharest. “His strategy has not, and will not, work.” Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. Kuleba also said Ukraine would eventually become a member of Nato, saying that didn’t mean nothing could be done now in that respect. “The discussions on Ukraine’s Nato application should begin,” he said during a press conference after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Bucharest. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. The city council announced the decision to remove the statue on its website on Wednesday. Local lawmakers had also voted to remove and relocate a monument to an 18th-century Russian general, Alexander Suvorov. A slim majority of Odesa residents had already voted – in an online poll organised by city authorities – to remove the statue to Catherine the Great, who was empress of Russia from 1762 to 1796. Several petitions had also been submitted to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling for the statue to be removed, but only local authorities were legally empowered to make the decision. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Alexei Kudrin has become the latest high-profile Russian government official to leave their post since the invasion. Kudrin, who was head of the audit committee and previously served as finance minister and deputy prime minister, is expected to take up a role at a Russian tech firm Yandex. Yandex has announced a review of its governance. The time in Kyiv is 1.20pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s top stories so far: The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money.” Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Hello, I’m Tom Ambrose, taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. The nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest and in the east of Ukraine, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. It has not been producing electricity since September but is still run by its Ukrainian staff to keep it safe. Moscow said in October it was putting the plant under control of Russia’s nuclear authorities, Reuters reports, a move Kyiv says is illegal. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said in May that Russia had forbidden Chernichuk from leaving the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is based, holding him and other staff as “hostages”. The six-reactor plant has since come under repeated shelling, drawing condemnation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has called for a safety zone around it, a proposal so far resisted by Moscow. Russia and Ukraine each blame the other for the shelling at the plant, located on a Russian-held bank of the Dnipro River across from Ukrainian-held territory. Kyiv also accuses Moscow of hiding military equipment at the plant, which Russia denies. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. On Monday, Russia postponed talks with the US on nuclear weapons, saying they would be rescheduled but not giving any reasons for the delay. The Start treaty will expire in 2026. Shiogu said 300,000 reservists, including volunteers, were trained in two months after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order was given, Russian news agency Tass reports. The defence minister said more than 100 training camps were used in Russia and Belarus. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. According to the Interfax news agency, a spokesperson said: “Yermak informed the interlocutor about the operational situation at the front, as well as about the possible steps Russia is preparing to continue terror against the civilian population of Ukraine. “The parties discussed providing support to our state to ensure the passage of the winter period.” The UK is to sign a new digital trade agreement with Ukraine that will give the country access to Britain’s financial services industry. Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, will sign the agreement with the UK’s trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on Wednesday. Officials say the deal – based on a similar agreement earlier this year between the UK and Singapore – will support digital commerce through the facilitation of cross-border data flows. Digital trade is considered to be particularly important in the current conflict with Russia, PA Media reports, with the fighting and damage to infrastructure making physical trade more difficult. The agreement also allows for greater cooperation between the UK and Ukraine on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. Badenoch said: “The landmark digital trade deal agreed today between our two countries paves the way for a new era of modern trade between us. This agreement will mean our businesses and governments can collaborate even more and ensure Ukrainians have access to essential goods and services [that] digital trade opens up.” The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far. “Russia must pay for its horrific crimes, including for its crime of aggression against a sovereign state. This is why, while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court backed by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. “We are ready to start working with the international community to get the broadest international support possible for this specialised court. “Russia must also pay financially for the devastation that it has caused. The damage suffered by Ukraine is estimated at €600bn. Russia and its oligarchs have to compensate Ukraine for its damage and for the costs for rebuilding the country.” She proposes that the EU could seize Russian money in Europe, invest it, and use it to finance the rebuilding (see 8.02am). “Russia’s horrific crimes will not go unpunished,” she said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and said it has not committed war crimes, despite evidence of a massacre in Bucha. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said more than 400 war crimes were committed in Kherson during the occupation of the city. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. She said that in the short term the EU and its partners could manage the funds and invest them. The proceeds would go to Ukraine so that ultimately they would compensate for damage caused to the country, Reuters reports. “We will work on an international agreement with our partners to make this possible. And together, we can find legal ways to get to it,” she said. An interesting story here, as the BBC has been given details of calls made to a hotline set up for Russian soldiers to surrender. The “I Want to Live” scheme was started in September by Ukraine, and gives Russian troops a way to give themselves up to Ukrainian forces. It includes a hotline and a messaging app. Officials in Kyiv have told the BBC they have had 3,500 inquiries from personnel, some on the frontline and some in Russia before deployment, and their families. Svitlana, not her real name, is one of the call handlers who speaks to them. “First of all, we hear a voice, mainly male. It’s often part-desperate, part-frustrated, because they don’t fully understand how the hotline works, or whether it’s just a set up. “There’s also curiosity because many call not to surrender but to find out how they could if needed. It’s different every time.” Recordings provided to the broadcaster include soldiers asking what to do when Ukrainian troops arrive. “Do I drop to my knees, or what? What do I do, how do I surrender?” one asked. Another said: “I am from Moscow. I haven’t received a conscription ticket yet, but there were attempts to give it to me. Do you have any advice as to what I should do? I won’t kill Ukrainians. I would like to save my life.” Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks, and another six armoured personnel carriers. The casualty figures published by Ukraine are disputed by Russia, which says its death toll from the war is much lower. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Both are in Ukraine’s east. “The threat of missile strikes by Russian invaders on energy system facilities and critical infrastructure throughout Ukraine remains,” he continued. Štupun said attacks from Russian jets had caused fires in Kizomis, a small town on the outskirts of Kherson near the Dnipro River estuary. Artillery shelling continues on Kherson city itself, according to the update. He added that in response Ukrainian planes had launched 15 strikes on Russian positions and equipment, and two air attacks on anti-aircraft missile systems. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. Previously it was limited to people who the Kremlin alleged had received financial support from abroad. However, it will now extend to those the government perceives as under the “influence or pressure” of foreign actors. The MoD said: “The Kremlin is likely acting pre-emptively to prevent greater domestic dissent as the conflict remains unresolved and increasingly impacts Russians’ everyday lives.” In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. “In one of the settlements of the Zaporizhzhia district, a gas distribution point was damaged as a result of a rocket (probably S-300) hit, resulting in a fire. It was quickly eliminated, but three streets remained without gas. Fortunately, people were not hurt,” he wrote. Hi, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram a short while ago that Russian strikes overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Meanwhile, Nato leaders will meet for a second day of talks in Romania on Wednesday, after vowing more help for Ukraine to restore power and heat knocked out by strikes as Russia attacks on multiple fronts. Here are the other key recent developments: Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment. Ukraine’s state energy operator, Ukrenegro, has said it is still struggling to restore full power nearly a week after Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country. The power deficit was running at 30% as of 11am local time on Tuesday, Ukrenegro said in a statement, a slight rise from the previous day. The jailed Belarusian senior opposition leader Maria Kolesnikava has been taken to intensive care in the city of Gomel, according to reports. Belarusian opposition politician Viktor Babariko posted to Telegram that Kolesnikova, one of the most prominent opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko, was taken to hospital on Monday for unknown reasons. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Moscow had been left with “no other choice” but to cancel nuclear weapons talks with the US, state-run news agencies reported. He said it was unlikely any meeting would take place this year. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused the US of “the highest level of toxicity and hostility” and of “a pathological desire to harm our country”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has said Beijing is ready to “forge a closer partnership” with Moscow to “maintain international energy security”. “China is willing to work with Russia to forge a closer energy partnership, promote clean and green energy development and jointly maintain international energy security and the stability of industry supply chains,” Xi was cited by state-owned broadcaster CCTV as writing. Ukraine has detained a deputy head of newly liberated Kherson’s city council on suspicion of aiding and abetting Russian occupation forces, Ukraine’s state prosecutor has said. The official, who was not named, cooperated with the occupation authorities and helped with the functioning of public services under the Russians, according to the prosecutor. European Union countries are inching towards a deal this week on a price cap on Russian oil, a way to adjust the cap in future, and on linking it to a package of new sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, diplomats said on Tuesday. The deadline for a deal is 5 December because that is when the EU’s own full embargo on purchases of Russian seaborne oil, agreed at the end of May, kicks in. The G7 group has agreed to set up a network to coordinate investigations into war crimes, as part of a push to prosecute suspected atrocities in Ukraine. In a joint declaration, G7 justice ministers said member countries would ensure there is a central national contact point in each state for the prosecution of international crimes. Pope Francis has sparked fury in Russia over an interview in which he suggested that Chechen and Buryat members of its armed forces showed more cruelty in Ukraine than ethnic Russian soldiers. He said soldiers from Buryatia, where Buddhism is a major religion, and the Muslim-majority Chechnya republic, were “the cruellest” while fighting in Ukraine. Germany’s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, said his country contributed to the outbreak of war by “adhering” to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Buschmann also said Russian missile strikes on energy infrastructure constituted a “terrible war crime”, adding that he was “certain that at the end, we will see war crimes cases at the international criminal court against senior Russian leadership too”.",

Zelenskiy himself did not refer to the attack specifically in his nightly address. But the Ukrainian president said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border.

Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to Kherson’s regional governor, said it was “the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region” and “a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive”.</p> <h2>How do they say it has gone so far?</h2> <p>Arestovych said Ukrainian troops were attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. He also said ferries on the west bank of the Dnieper River, which are being used to supply Russian forces in the territory, were being shelled.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62712299\">The BBC reported</a> officials in Kyiv claiming that US-supplied Himars rocket systems had been used to destroy three bridges across the Dnieper as well as temporary bridges created by Russian forces.

A senior official in Nova Kakhovka told Ria that civilians had been ordered to take refuge in bomb shelters.</p> <p>The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had sustained significant casualties and claimed the “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”. The FT reported that Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that the claimed counterattack was “the latest fake [news] from Ukrainian propaganda” and said Ukraine’s forces were “taking extremely severe losses”.</p> <p>Again, it is not yet possible to verify these claims, and Russia routinely inflates the scale of Ukrainian losses in its updates. Recently, western and Ukrainian intelligence have noted a buildup of Russian troops and equipment in the region, potentially suggesting Russia was preparing its own offensive.</p> <h2>What are the prospects of success?</h2> <p>Humenyuk told reporters that Russian forces were strong in the region – and that even though morale was low among their ranks, “it was too early to relax”. In comments on his Telegram account reported by the Guardian’s Samantha Lock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live?page=with:block-630da74d8f080ba02dce9b90#block-630da74d8f080ba02dce9b90\">on the live blog</a>, Arestovych characterised the action as “a planned slow operation to grind the enemy” and said: “This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.”</p> <p>Ukraine’s ability to conduct its claimed counteroffensive has been greatly enhanced by the provision of weapons by the west, and Russian positions in the region have been under artillery barrage for weeks and cut off from their supply lines.</p> <p>But it is too early to say whether those successes will translate to victory on the ground. A US official <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-counteroffensive.html\">quoted by the New York Times</a> said the Pentagon “remained cautious about whether Ukraine’s current military capabilities were sufficient to make significant gains”.</p> <h2>Why is an attack in Kherson significant?</h2> <p>Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance as the only regional capital to have been secured by the Russian invaders – and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success.</p> <p>That would disrupt Russian attempts to proceed with a sham referendum designed to give credibility to Moscow’s claims that residents of Kherson and other parts of southern Ukraine wish to be part of Russia. For more on how that prospect is viewed by citizens in Kherson, read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/ukraine-kherson-region-referendum-russia\">this piece</a> by Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer from earlier this month, in which one interviewee says: “No one thought about [a referendum] before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint.”</p> <p>There has been a growing sense that if Kyiv is to retake the city, it must do so as a matter of urgency: changing weather – including rain that will make the countryside muddy and far harder for ground troops to traverse – in the autumn means there is a powerful incentive to launch a counteroffensive now. There are also fears European support could fade as the impact of high energy prices begins to take hold.</p> <p>Success in any operation to take Kherson could break a long period of deadlock – and persuade western allies that it is worth continuing to provide the arms and funding that Ukraine needs. But if an attack fails, Ukrainian morale would be undermined, and Russia’s plans to bring the south of the country under its full control would be reinforced.</p>",

While witnesses reported blasts in the cities of Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, the extent and success of Ukrainian operations are yet to be confirmed. The Financial Times reported remarks from John Kirby, a US national security spokesperson, who said Ukraine’s actions had “already had an impact on Russia’s military capabilities” because Moscow had been forced to divert resources to the region from the east of the country. This at-a-glance piece gives a wider picture of the situation in Ukraine this morning, including news of a team of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, where Kyiv claims Russian occupiers are violating nuclear safety protocols. What does Russia say? Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cited the defence ministry in Moscow as acknowledging that Ukrainian troops attempted an offensive in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. A senior official in Nova Kakhovka told Ria that civilians had been ordered to take refuge in bomb shelters. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had sustained significant casualties and claimed the “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”. The FT reported that Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that the claimed counterattack was “the latest fake [news] from Ukrainian propaganda” and said Ukraine’s forces were “taking extremely severe losses”. Again, it is not yet possible to verify these claims, and Russia routinely inflates the scale of Ukrainian losses in its updates. Recently, western and Ukrainian intelligence have noted a buildup of Russian troops and equipment in the region, potentially suggesting Russia was preparing its own offensive. What are the prospects of success? Humenyuk told reporters that Russian forces were strong in the region – and that even though morale was low among their ranks, “it was too early to relax”. In comments on his Telegram account reported by the Guardian’s Samantha Lock on the live blog, Arestovych characterised the action as “a planned slow operation to grind the enemy” and said: “This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ability to conduct its claimed counteroffensive has been greatly enhanced by the provision of weapons by the west, and Russian positions in the region have been under artillery barrage for weeks and cut off from their supply lines. But it is too early to say whether those successes will translate to victory on the ground. A US official quoted by the New York Times said the Pentagon “remained cautious about whether Ukraine’s current military capabilities were sufficient to make significant gains”. Why is an attack in Kherson significant? Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance as the only regional capital to have been secured by the Russian invaders – and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success. That would disrupt Russian attempts to proceed with a sham referendum designed to give credibility to Moscow’s claims that residents of Kherson and other parts of southern Ukraine wish to be part of Russia. For more on how that prospect is viewed by citizens in Kherson, read this piece by Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer from earlier this month, in which one interviewee says: “No one thought about [a referendum] before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint.” There has been a growing sense that if Kyiv is to retake the city, it must do so as a matter of urgency: changing weather – including rain that will make the countryside muddy and far harder for ground troops to traverse – in the autumn means there is a powerful incentive to launch a counteroffensive now. There are also fears European support could fade as the impact of high energy prices begins to take hold. Success in any operation to take Kherson could break a long period of deadlock – and persuade western allies that it is worth continuing to provide the arms and funding that Ukraine needs. But if an attack fails, Ukrainian morale would be undermined, and Russia’s plans to bring the south of the country under its full control would be reinforced.",

Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine.</strong> The US president was asked in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-joe-biden-vladimir-putin-60-minutes-2022-09-16/\">CBS News</a> what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons.

But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Mexico will present a peace plan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says.</strong> Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. </strong>Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required.

Nineteen states abstained.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said</strong> of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves </strong>discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops</strong>, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces<strong>. </strong>The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. </strong>At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Further south,</strong> <strong>the Russian-backed separatist authority in</strong> <strong>Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder”</strong> of<strong> </strong>a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance</strong> to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”.

This is what you might have missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK </strong><strong>Ministry of </strong><strong>Defence says.</strong> Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/ukraine-has-retaken-6000-sq-km-zelenskiy-says-as-he-calls-for-air-defence-aid\">6,000 sq km of territory</a> including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia.</strong> Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine.</strong> The US president was asked in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-joe-biden-vladimir-putin-60-minutes-2022-09-16/\">CBS News</a> what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”.</strong> Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Mexico will present a peace plan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> to the United Nations general assembly next week, </strong><strong>president </strong><strong>Andrés Manuel López Obrador says.</strong> Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. </strong>Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said</strong> of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves </strong>discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops</strong>, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces<strong>. </strong>The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. </strong>At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Further south,</strong> <strong>the Russian-backed separatist authority in</strong> <strong>Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder”</strong> of<strong> </strong>a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>In the southern oblast of Zaporizhzhia</strong> <strong>there were also reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol</strong>, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. “I hope the Russian fascists have suffered losses, among their personnel and equipment,” he said. “Awaiting good news from the armed forces of Ukraine.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance</strong> to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Switzerland</strong> <strong>on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the country. </strong>“The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council <a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-ends-fast-track-visas-for-russian-nationals/47905818\">said in a statement</a>. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider visa ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-09-17T10:23:22.968Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-632597ea8f083f878e70f343\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-09-17T09:53:18.915Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine’s ministry of defence has given its latest update on Russia’s total combat losses since the war started in February this year.</strong></p> \n  <p>The figures show that Vladimir Putin’s military forces have lost 54,250 troops, 2,202 tanks, and 4,701 armoured combat vehicles.</p> \n  <p>Ukrainian forces have also downed 251 military jets, 216 helicopters and 911 drones.</p> \n  <p>The figures could not be independently verified.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1571071461904637952\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Sometimes it seems that russia is destined only to show the whole world how not to live and what not to do.\"<br>Petr Chaadaev<br><br>Total combat losses of the enemy from Feb 24 to Sep 17: <a href=\"https://t.co/wykj2QHtYD\">pic.twitter.com/wykj2QHtYD</a></p>— Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1571071461904637952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-632591408f0836766296de0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-09-17T09:24:40.096Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em><strong>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</strong>, the leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, writes for us that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/17/election-belarus-russia-lukashenko-vladimir-putin-sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya\">she lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia:</a></em></p> \n  <p>Peat bogs span almost 15% of my home country of Belarus.

                    "bodyText": "It’s almost 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavsky, foreign minister of the Czech Republic which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Hundreds of hastily buried bodies were discovered two days ago, including those of children and Ukrainian soldiers, after Izium was liberated from Russian forces. Activists from the environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. “The shipment contained liquefied natural gas coming from Russia,” Olga Vaisanen, a spokesperson for Gasum, the Finnish company that imported the blocked gas, told Agence France-Presse. Mika Kolehmainen, the director for the terminal’s operator, Manga LNG, said the action took place around 7am (0400 GMT) at Tornio port. The operator said the activists climbed the loading arms that allow for the transfer of material and there were two Greenpeace ships outside the terminal’s area, close to the Swedish border. “It’s completely unacceptable that Russian gas is still allowed to flow in Finland, more than six months after Putin launched his invasion,” a Greenpeace activist, Olli Tiainen, said in a statement. “The Finnish government and Prime Minister Sanna Marin must ban all fossil fuel imports from Russia immediately,” he added. There are currently no EU or Swedish sanctions on gas imports from Russia, only on oil and coal. In May, Russia cut gas deliveries by pipeline to Finland, claiming there were issues with payments, but deliveries by sea continue. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, foreign minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” he said on Twitter. “I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” The appeal follows the discovery by Ukrainian authorities of around 450 graves outside the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, with most of the bodies showing signs of torture. Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99 percent showed signs of violent death,” Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said. “There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck,” he added. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. For 40 minutes, they had been using a stun gun on me, then they shot at me with either an airgun or a gas gun, I don’t know – I was in a bag,” the Kyiv Independent reported one victim saying. Hi everyone, I’m Maya Yang and I’ll be taking over the blog next with the latest updates. Stay tuned. Hundreds of people gathered in Kyiv to say farewell to beloved Ukrainian ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval, who was killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine. Some dropped to their knees and others clapped as soldiers carried his casket draped in a Ukrainian flag into the National Kyiv Opera. Relatives, colleagues, soldiers and fans came holding flowers walking past photos of the artist on stage and on the frontlines, AFP reports. Shapoval’s two teenage daughters were in the crowd. Shapoval, 47, had been a ballet dancer with the Kyiv Opera since 1994. He retired and started teaching dance in 2021, before volunteering to help defend his country on 25 February, the day after Russia’s invasion. After Russian troops withdrew from Kyiv, Shapoval fought in the eastern industrial Donbas region. He died in mortar shelling near Mayorsk, in the Donetsk region, on 12 September. Ukrainian authorities exhumed more corpses from a burial site by a cemetery in the town of Izium where officials say hundreds are buried in territory recaptured from Russian forces. Up to 30 emergency service officers carefully dug up bodies at the wooded burial site in Izium using shovels. Police experts and investigators documented the findings on camera and inspected the bodies. Some bodies found so far have been of Ukrainian soldiers while others were civilians, Reuters reports. Some more details on the situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, from Reuters. Even though the six reactors have been shut down, the fuel in them still needs cooling to avoid a potentially catastrophic meltdown. That means the plant needs electricity to pump water through the core of the reactors. The power supply at Zaporizhzhia has been a source of major concern after the last main line went down and then three backup lines that can connect it to a nearby coal-fired power plant were also disconnected. That prompted the plant to go into so-called “island mode” where its last operating reactor provided it with power, though that mode is not sustainable. A backup power line was reconnected a week ago, enabling that reactor to shut down, too. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the site of Zaporizhzhia that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and has resumed supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog said. “With the main line’s reconnection yesterday afternoon, the three backup power lines are again being held in reserve,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said. “The three other main external 750kv (kilovolt) power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down.” It is just after 6pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: “Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine. I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.” Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Volodymyr Zelenskiy invoked the names of other Ukrainian cities where authorities said retreating Russian troops left behind mass graves of civilians, Associated Press reported. “Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium,” Ukraine’s president said. “Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it.” In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression. One person was killed and two more injured today after Ukrainian shelling of a village in Russia. The alleged attack occurred in the city of Belgorod, not far from the border with Ukraine, the TASS news agency cited local authorities as saying. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. An honour guard fired a three-gun salute toward cloudy skies as friends and comrades-in-arms gathered in Kyiv to bid farewell to a Russian woman who was killed while fighting on Ukraine’s side in the war with her native country, Associated Press reports. Olga Simonova, 34, was remembered for her courage and kindness at a funeral in the Ukrainian capital on Friday. Simonova’s coffin was draped in the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag, with a cuddly toy lion on top. Her nom de guerre was “Simba”, the name of the main character in the Disney cartoon The Lion King. Born in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, Simonova said she started feeling uncomfortable about her native country after reading about Russia’s war in Chechnya and its actions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Filled with doubts that she “would ever be able to raise the flag of my country, my homeland” again, Simonova travelled to Ukraine to join the conflict in the Donbas on the Ukrainian side, first as a volunteer fighter, then as a paramedic and ultimately as an enlisted member of the armed forces. Friends and colleagues said Simonova, who was unmarried and had no children, had recently redeployed from the east to the southern Kherson region, where Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces. They said she died on 13 September, after her vehicle hit a landmine. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. He said on Telegram: An innocent child died from Russian terror. Unfortunately, the 11-year-old girl, who was hospitalised in Chuguyev, died from her injuries. Another woman was injured after the attacks on Chuguiev; the condition of the victim is average. The report could not be independently verified. Ukrainian forces have continued to cross the key Oskil River in the Kharkiv region as they try to press on in a counteroffensive targeting Russian-occupied territory, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The institute said in today’s report that satellite imagery it examined suggested that Ukrainian forces have crossed over to the east bank of the Oskil in Kupiansk, placing artillery there. The river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged frontlines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago, reports Associated Press. The institute said: Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River if Ukrainian forces choose to resume offensive operations. President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has responded to reports that Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week. Directing his tweet at Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Podolyak said: “Peacemakers” who use war as a topic for their own PR are causing only surprise. @lopezobrador_, is your plan to keep millions under occupation, increase the number of mass burials and give Russia time to renew reserves before the next offensive? Then your “plan” is a plan. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal to be put forward by Mexico is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Russia’s defence ministry today said that its forces have launched strikes on several parts of Ukraine. It also accused Kyiv of carrying out shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. Russian forces conducted their strikes in the Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, according to the ministry. It said that Ukrainian forces had carried out an unsuccessful offensive near Pravdyne in Kherson. The radiation situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, remains normal, according to the ministry. It said two incidents of Ukrainian shelling were recorded near the plant on Saturday. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry denied that Ukrainian forces had carried out shelling near the facility. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the nuclear power plant. The UN International Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution on Thursday demanding that Russia end its occupation of the plant. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. On the Telegram, he said: On September 16, the Russians killed 2 civilians of Donetsk region: in Sviatohirsk and Bakhmut. Another 11 people were injured. Currently, it is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in Mariupol and Volnovas. It was not possible to independently verify the report. Our report on US president, Joe Biden’s, first meeting with the family members of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan: Joe Biden, met with family members of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another American detained in Russia, Paul Whelan, on Friday, the first face-to-face encounter that the president has had with the relatives. In a statement after the meetings, which were held separately, White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said Biden stressed to the families his “continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely”. “He asked after the well-being of Elizabeth and Cherelle and their respective families during this painful time,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who love them most, and acknowledged that every minute they are being held is a minute too long.” Read more: Joe Biden meets with families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan It is just after 1pm in Kyiv. This is what you might have missed: Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.” Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. In the southern oblast of Zaporizhzhia there were also reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. “I hope the Russian fascists have suffered losses, among their personnel and equipment,” he said. “Awaiting good news from the armed forces of Ukraine.” The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. Switzerland on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the country. “The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council said in a statement. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider visa ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has given its latest update on Russia’s total combat losses since the war started in February this year. The figures show that Vladimir Putin’s military forces have lost 54,250 troops, 2,202 tanks, and 4,701 armoured combat vehicles. Ukrainian forces have also downed 251 military jets, 216 helicopters and 911 drones. The figures could not be independently verified. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, writes for us that she lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia: Peat bogs span almost 15% of my home country of Belarus. But, in recent times, citizens have grown wary of these dense, acidic wetlands. Their decaying vegetative matter is a valuable source of fuel and, after decades of being gradually drained and stripped away, the drying marshes that remain pose a significant fire risk. Smouldering underground fires can burn for months unseen before bursting out into the open and wreaking devastation. Much like these underground peat fires that grow shielded from view, democracy in Belarus is currently burning and President Alexander Lukashenko’s corrupt, despotic regime is the decaying marshland, tinder-dry and ripe for destruction. Read more here: I lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has urged European countries to provide Ukraine with “modern and effective” missile defence systems. His tweet comes after Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Our colleague Dan Sabbagh writes that Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war: The Ukrainian video begins with the Dunkirk beach scene from the film Atonement, the soldiers’ stirring rendition of Dear Lord and Father of Mankind. Until it transitions to several hundred Ukrainian troops, singing the country’s national anthem in the open air, ahead of last week’s successful Kharkiv offensive. Life may be trying to imitate art, but in this case there is no clearer demonstration of Ukrainian national morale as the war heads towards the end of its seventh month. The unprovoked attack by their larger neighbour has unleashed a patriotic mobilisation that is having a transformational effect on the battlefield. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s analysis here: Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war In case you missed it on Friday, Ukrainian authorities say they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. The US president refused to elaborate on what the US would do if Putin did take things that far. He added: They’ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he had spoken to Nike Inc and thanked the US sport manufacturer for making what he called the “right decision” to pull out of Russia. “This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom,” Reuters reported the Ukrainian president as saying in his nightly video address. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state. Nike told Reuters in June that it was making a full exit from Russia. Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Kuleba said in an interview with German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published online: We ask for Leopard tanks and Marder [armoured vehicles] and Germany supplies armoured vehicles of the Dingo type We are grateful for them. But that is not what we need most in combat ... What is the problem? Why can’t we get what we need, and what Germany has? Germany has sent a raft of different armaments to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February but has so far refused to transfer Leopards and Marders, despite repeated requests from Kyiv. Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK ministry of defence says.

Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Lopez Obrador said in a speech marking Mexican Independence Day: It’s a matter of urgently seeking an agreement to stop the war in Ukraine. The peacemaking mission should immediately seek a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and the start of direct talks with Ukranian president Zelensky and Russian president Putin. Lopez Obrador, whose country is a non-permanent member of the UN security council, criticised the UN for being “inactive” in the face of the conflict. He said his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, would present the proposal to the UN general assembly in New York, which will be addressed by about 150 heads of state and government. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: We aren’t in a rush. The Russian leader added that Moscow has only deployed volunteer soldiers to fight in Ukraine. Russia pulled back its forces from large swaths of north-eastern Ukraine last week after a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive. In his first comment on the Ukrainian advance, Putin said: “Let’s see how it develops and how it ends.” He said Ukraine had tried to strike civilian infrastructure in Russia and “we so far have responded with restraint, but just yet””. If the situation develops this way, our response will be more serious. “Just recently, the Russian armed forces have delivered a couple of impactful strikes,” he said, in an apparent reference to Russian attacks earlier this week on power plants in northern Ukraine and a dam in the south. Let’s consider those as warning strikes. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. These are the latest developments as it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition.

Putin said he invaded Ukraine because the west wanted to break up Russia. He grinned when asked about Ukraine’s recent military success, saying: “Let’s see how it develops, how it ends up.” Putin said nothing had changed with the ultimate goal of Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, which was to capture the Donbas. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”.

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda. Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports. The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official. The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement: The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read. Read the full story here. The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark. The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said. Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing: It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy told reporters: We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets. Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP. “We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added: We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist. Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said: The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion. In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn. More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added. Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied. Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”. “The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said. She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state. A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin.

Here’s where we stand: Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.

The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, has said Russian rockets are falling on homes in the city and urged residents to stay under cover. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include “high-ranking Russian government officials, including Russian federal governors and regional heads, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities”, a statement by the Canadian government said. In addition, the government has imposed sanctions on the Russian defence firm Avtomatika, which makes drones and electronic voting machines. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. About 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, Richard Harrington said. Six months after the Russian invasion, the government is asking existing hosts to allow Ukrainians to stay for longer than the minimum period of half a year, while also appealing for new sponsors. The move comes amid soaring living costs, with energy bills expected to rise by 80% going into winter, rocketing inflation and rising interest rates. Councils have also warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform conference. The PM called on allies to continue to support Ukraine until Russian forces withdrew from the “entirety” of its territory. Johnson said: Putin is planning to do to other parts of Ukraine - indeed all of Ukraine – what he has done to Crimea. The Russian leader was preparing “more annexations and more sham referendums”, he added. Russia’s annexation of Crimea “or any other Ukrainian territory” must never be recognised, Johnson urged. Scouts in the UK have been praised for setting adults an example on how to welcome refugees after they made hundreds of messages of support for Ukrainian families fleeing the war. “You are so brave and I hope you like it here,” wrote one scout in a decorated card. Another said: “REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED.” Among other messages were: “Let us take you to safety” and “You should try fish and chips.” The messages from scouts aged 12-15 were made to mark six months since the start of Russia’s invasion. They will be shared with recently settled Ukrainian families in the UK in welcome packs from Save the Children. Meg Briody, the head of child and youth participation at Save the Children, said the messages showed the best side of the UK’s attitudes towards refugees. Children and young people are once again setting an example in showing that the UK can be a welcoming place for refugees. Read the full story by my colleague Matthew Weaver here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. In a speech to open an international conference on Crimea, the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. Zelenskiy said: To overcome terror, it is necessary to gain victory in the fight against Russian aggression. It is necessary to liberate Crimea. This will be the resuscitation of world law and order. Therefore, we need to free Crimea from occupation as well. It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea. In a separate speech today to mark Ukraine’s national flag day and on the eve of the country’s independence day, Zelenskiy pledged that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. He said: The blue and yellow flag will flutter again at its home, where it’s supposed to be by right, in all temporarily occupied cities and villages of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president also spoke in a joint news conference with visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda, where he was asked about the possibility of a Russian missile strike on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy replied. The response to an attack on the Ukrainian capital would be the same for any Ukrainian city that comes under attack from Russia, he added. Zelenskiy said: If they hit us, they will receive a response, a powerful response. I want to say that each day this response will grow, it will get stronger and stronger. Germany has recorded almost a million refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, the country’s interior ministry said. A total of 967,546 people fleeing the war have entered Germany at least temporarily, the ministry said in a statement. Of those who have left Ukraine for Germany, 36% are children. Among the adults, three in four are women and around 8% are over the age of 64. Almost 155,000 Ukrainian pupils have been enrolled at German schools, according to the conference of state education ministers in Berlin. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol, saying that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, according to Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN rights office. She said: We are very concerned about the manner in which this is being done. There are pictures in the media of cages being built in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall, really massive cages and apparently the idea is to restrain the prisoners. She added: This is not acceptable, this is humiliating. Willfully depriving a prisoner of war to the right to a fair trial amounts to a war crime by Russia, she said, adding that Ukrainian PoWs were entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions. Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence said Russian forces were allegedly planning to display captured Ukrainian soldiers in iron cages during a “show trial” in Mariupol on the country’s independence day. The captured fighters who will reportedly be displayed in the cages in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall are those who were captured while defending the formerly-besieged Azovstal steel plant. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the EU to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists, arguing that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. The Ukrainian president’s call has been backed by several EU leaders including the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland all share a border with Russia. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius today. He said: I have talked to ministers from all these countries … I don’t see many differences politically. On Monday, the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians, saying the Biden administration had already imposed visa restrictions for Kremlin officials but that its focus would be on identifying those involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and holding them accountable. A US state department spokesperson said: The US wouldn’t want to close off pathways to refuge and safety for Russia’s dissidents or others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. An adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. Rodnyansky said: People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government. He added: There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months. Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. He also said support for the war in Russia is falling and the Kremlin needs to introduce general mobilisation. The time is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov has said that Russian rockets are falling on homes and urged Ukrainians in the city to stay under cover. In a post on his Facebook page, he said: “Pls stay under cover. There are already facts of rockets falling on private houses. Details to come later. We are waiting for official information from the Military Administration.” Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. Ukraine‘s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on 24 February and blockaded its Black Sea ports. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk reported that 825 people have been evacuated from the Kharkiv region in north-east Ukraine. In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: “The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president has said. Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, something Kyiv denies. Senior politicians, fellow nationalists and friends filed past Dugina’s dark wooden casket in a hall at Moscow’s TV centre on Tuesday morning to say goodbye, lay flowers, and convey their condolences to her parents who were sitting nearby. A large black and white photograph of Dugina, 30, who worked as a journalist and nationalist media commentator, hung on a black wall behind her casket as sombre music played, Reuters reports. Her father, Dugin, 60, who has for years advocated the creation of a new Russian empire that would absorb the territory of countries such as Ukraine, told mourners his daughter had died for Russia. A visibly distressed Dugin said: If her tragic death has touched someone, she would have asked them to defend sacred (Russian) Orthodoxy, the people and the Fatherland. She died for Russia, in the motherland and on the frontline which is not in Ukraine but here. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov has said that rockets are falling on homes and urged Ukrainians in the city to stay under cover. In a post on his Facebook page he said: Pls stay under cover. There are already facts of rockets falling on private houses. Details to come later. We are waiting for official information from the Military Administration. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. Porsches, Bentleys and other luxury cars with Russian licence plates are filling up the parking garage at Helsinki’s airport as Finland becomes an important transit country for Russian tourists flying to Europe, reports AFP. The European Union shut its airspace to Russian planes after Moscow invaded Ukraine, forcing anyone who wants to travel to Europe to drive across the border or take a circuitous route using non-Western airlines. A quick stroll through the carpark at the Helsinki airport revealed dozens if not hundreds of high-end cars with Russian plates, including a new Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan and Porsche 911 Turbo S. Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto told AFP that the Nordic nation has become a “transit country” for Russian tourists. Finland said last week it would limit Russian tourist visas to 10% of current volumes as of 1 September due to rising discontent over Russian tourism amid the war in Ukraine. But Russians continue to enter Finland with visas issued by other EU countries in the Schengen borderless travel area for their journeys. Schengen rules do not allow Finland to close the border to specific nationalities, Haavisto said. Such sanctions can only be decided jointly by the EU. The European Commission acknowledged last week that discussions were under way to see if a “coordinated approach” on Russian visas could be reached. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has paid tribute to Ukrainians for “giving their lives to protect the values” on which the European bloc is built. To commemorate the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes today, she said in a statement: On 23 August, we honour the memory of the victims of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, in Europe and beyond. Today, on the 83rd anniversary of the signature of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, this date carries a special significance. This year, Putin brought the horrors of war back to Europe, along with the reminder that peace cannot be taken for granted. The painful memory of the past is not just a distant recollection, but has found an echo in Russia’s illegal and unjustified war against Ukraine. We are inspired by the courage of those who then stood up to injustice, and we express our respect and support for the many men and women who are forced to do it again today. Ukrainian people are giving their lives to protect the values on which our Union is built. Today more than ever, we stand united against the Russian state-controlled propaganda that distorts history, spreads conspiracy and punishes those who oppose it. We will continue with determination our work to counter disinformation. And we will ensure that those who stood against totalitarianism will not be forgotten. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. For several weeks, Russian forces and local civilians have relied on a ferry crossing of the waterway, the update said. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. The update added that the floating bridge would likely still be vulnerable to Ukrainian assaults. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. The Joint Coordination Centre in Turkey, which monitors implementation of the agreement, put the total amount of grain and foodstuffs exported from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports since the deal was reached at 721,449 tonnes. Ukraine‘s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on 24 February and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East, reports Reuters. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. In addition to the vessels that have already left Ukraine, the agriculture ministry said a further 18 were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports. The ministry said Ukrainian grain exports could reach 4m tonnes in August, compared with 3m tonnes in July. Isobel Koshiw reports: The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is “stepping up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning, issued on Tuesday, is the first specific security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv in recent months. It does not say what places it believes Russia plans to target, but advised US citizens to leave Ukraine if safe to do so. The alert comes a day before Ukraine marks 31 years as an independent state. On 24 August 1991, Ukraine’s parliament voted to separate from the Soviet Union. The day will also mark six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Some restaurants in Kyiv have been closing early this week because of the perceived increased threat.

In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. We thank the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Sinegubov for organizing the process, as well as volunteer organizations for their dedication and help. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. Pawel Szrot told reporters: The visit will include a meeting with President (Volodymyr) Zelenskiy and talks on military support and defence of Ukraine in the economic, humanitarian and political sense,” Pawel Szrot told reporters. The presidents will discuss the political support Poland could offer to convince other countries to keep helping Ukraine. Duda has met Zelenskiy five times this year, including on three visits he has made to Ukraine since the start of the invasion in February this year. Exports of key Ukrainian agricultural commodities have fallen by almost half since the start of the Russian invasion earlier this year compared with the same period in 2021, data from the agriculture ministry showed late on Monday. Ukrainian seaports have been blocked since the Russian invasion started in late February, leaving a vast amount of crops either unharvested or destroyed, reports Reuters. Agricultural exports between 24 February and 15 August this year fell to 10m tonnes from around 19.5m in the same period last year, the ministry data showed. The 2022 grain harvest in Ukraine is forecast to fall to around 50m tonnes from a record 86m tonnes in 2021. At the end of July, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. But even with the ports opened, Ukraine‘s agricultural exports are significantly lower than before the conflict, when Ukraine exported up to 6m tonnes of grain a month. It is 9am in Ukraine.

The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior advisor to the Ukrainian president has said. Mykhailo Podolyak suggested that 50 US-supplied Himars long-range weapons systems, at the cost of about $200m, would be needed to “completely change the course of this war”. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held later today to discuss the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has been taken over by Russian troops and has come under repeated shelling in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. It is unclear whether the meeting will be going ahead. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. Around 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, PA Media cited Lord Richard Harrington as saying. Lord Harrington said he has been lobbying the Treasury “very hard” to double the £350-a-month “thank you” payment for sponsors who house refugees for longer than half a year – the minimum period expected of hosts. He told PA Media: The costs … they’re paying maybe a big chunk of rent themselves, the mortgage payments have gone up and everything, and I think it’s perfectly reasonable, in my view, to increase the amount that we’re paying them.” More than 115,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under its visa schemes, according to the latest government figures, including around 81,700 refugees under the sponsorship scheme. Around 4,000-5,000 people are arriving each week, Lord Harrington added. Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. “The Russians made an explosion again. Loud that the whole city could hear. Just blowing up the boiler room. Instead of preparing the city for winter and building boiler houses, the occupiers destroy even the remains …” Unconfirmed video footage purportedly showing the moment the facility was struck has circulated online. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. In a statement released after ambassadors met at the UN security council on Monday, Guterres stressed: Nuclear saber-rattling must stop … come to the negotiating table to ease tensions and end the nuclear arms race, once and for all.” At this moment of “maximum danger for our world”, the secretary-general emphasised that “humanity’s future is in our hands”, insisting that division be replaced with dialogue and diplomacy, to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. He argued that negotiation, compromise, and accountability are required for the future, attesting that as it represents the nations of the world, the UN is “humanity’s best hope to build a better, more peaceful tomorrow”. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” The US intelligence community on Monday declassified a finding that determined that Russia would increasingly target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to a US official familiar with the intelligence. The official was not authorised to comment publicly about the finding and spoke on the condition of anonymity, the Associated Press reported. The alert also urged US citizens still in Ukraine to depart the country immediately. “If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover,” the state department said. “If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines.

The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The US has rejected Ukraine’s call for a blanket ban on visas for Russians, saying Washington would not want to close off pathways to refuge for Russia’s dissidents and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) said exports from two of its three mooring points at a Black Sea terminal had been suspended. A senior Russian diplomat has ruled out a diplomatic solution to ending the war in Ukraine. Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times that there would be no direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Moscow expects a prolonged conflict.",

equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine.</strong></p> <p>The Russian leader was speaking at the start of the meeting with defence industry officials gathered from across the country in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing. </p> <p>Putin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most important key task of our military-industrial complex is to provide our units and frontline forces with everything they need: weapons, equipment, ammunition, and gear in the necessary quantities and of the right quality in the shortest possible timeframes.</p> <p>It’s also important to perfect and significantly improve the technical characteristics of weapons and equipment for our fighters based on the combat experience we have gained.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that he was looking forward to their “proposals on addressing the problems that are inevitable in this large piece of work and how we will move forward and make sure there are fewer of them”.</p> <p>Putin’s remarks came just days after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/vladimir-putin-promises-army-anything-it-asks-for-as-invasion-enters-11th-month\">pledged</a> to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Speaking in Moscow at the closing session of the expanded board of the ministry of defence on Wednesday, he said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything.</p> </blockquote> <p>Russia is expected to dramatically increase its spending on the military in the next two years, as Putin signals that he is preparing for a prolonged and costly war with Ukraine. </p> <p>Earlier this month, he said the conflict could turn into a “long-term process”, and the Kremlin shows no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-63a5eb268f08c23d9f5d6df9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-12-23T17:56:04.851Z\">5.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">‘Deeply personal’ Zelenskiy-Biden meeting cemented their bond, says top adviser</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said in an interview on his return home.</strong></p> <p><strong>Andriy Yermak,</strong> the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> – and with senior US Republicans, despite “dirty” comments made by the Fox News host <strong>Tucker Carlson.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca97569830062ba82e6651b77f66228c9781294f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca97569830062ba82e6651b77f66228c9781294f/0_0_4316_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US President Joe Biden welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US President Joe Biden welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The summit and press conference between the two leaders this week demonstrated “how deeply in personal attitude President Biden feels everything which is connected to Ukraine”, Yermak said, and that the US was “a real leader of the free world and democracy”.</p> <p>Yermak’s emphasis on the personal links forged by the surprise visit, the first time Zelenskiy had been outside Ukraine since the start of the war, comes despite a failure to immediately obtain the US Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range army tactical missile system ATACMS that Ukraine has said it needs to defeat Russia.</p> <p>But it demonstrates a belief in Kyiv that Ukraine must emphasise the moral dimension of its fight against the invading Russian army and its faith in its relationship with the US to unlock more and more of the military aid it badly needs as the war heads towards its first anniversary in February.</p> <p>Yermak, who was by Zelenskiy’s side during the trip, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s [the] first time in history that Ukraine and [the] United States are close as strategic partners.

Here’s where things stand: President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it had supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the US for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. The Canadian government said Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, Zelenskiy added. Here’s more from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was speaking earlier at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors in Kyiv. Zelenskiy described his visit to the US as “a very important benchmark, as a set bar” at the meeting, adding: I do not have the opportunity to make foreign visits – I simply do not have it, because there’s no time. President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. The Russian leader was speaking at the start of the meeting with defence industry officials gathered from across the country in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing. Putin said: The most important key task of our military-industrial complex is to provide our units and frontline forces with everything they need: weapons, equipment, ammunition, and gear in the necessary quantities and of the right quality in the shortest possible timeframes. It’s also important to perfect and significantly improve the technical characteristics of weapons and equipment for our fighters based on the combat experience we have gained. He added that he was looking forward to their “proposals on addressing the problems that are inevitable in this large piece of work and how we will move forward and make sure there are fewer of them”. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Speaking in Moscow at the closing session of the expanded board of the ministry of defence on Wednesday, he said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. He added: The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything. Russia is expected to dramatically increase its spending on the military in the next two years, as Putin signals that he is preparing for a prolonged and costly war with Ukraine. Earlier this month, he said the conflict could turn into a “long-term process”, and the Kremlin shows no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said in an interview on his return home. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans, despite “dirty” comments made by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The summit and press conference between the two leaders this week demonstrated “how deeply in personal attitude President Biden feels everything which is connected to Ukraine”, Yermak said, and that the US was “a real leader of the free world and democracy”. Yermak’s emphasis on the personal links forged by the surprise visit, the first time Zelenskiy had been outside Ukraine since the start of the war, comes despite a failure to immediately obtain the US Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range army tactical missile system ATACMS that Ukraine has said it needs to defeat Russia. But it demonstrates a belief in Kyiv that Ukraine must emphasise the moral dimension of its fight against the invading Russian army and its faith in its relationship with the US to unlock more and more of the military aid it badly needs as the war heads towards its first anniversary in February. Yermak, who was by Zelenskiy’s side during the trip, said: It’s [the] first time in history that Ukraine and [the] United States are close as strategic partners. There is a very warm, very friendly relationship, [a] personal relationship between [the] two presidents. As well as the meeting with Biden, Yermak highlighted meetings Zelenskiy had with US congressional leaders, including those with senior Republicans Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, and Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate to become House speaker next month. Read the full story here: Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. Speaking at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We are already rebooting relations with dozens of African countries. Next year, we have to strengthen them. Ten countries have already been designated in Africa where new embassies of Ukraine will be opened. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, he added. Zelenskiy continued: In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in 10 African countries, together with new embassies and trading houses, we should achieve representation in 30 countries of the African continent. Like many Ukrainian refugees, Yuliia Kashperenko will spend Christmas away from home this year. She feels upset at the thought of being away from her family and friends in Ukraine, but comforted to know she will spend the holiday with her host and their children in south London. Kashperenko, 25, arrived the UK in October, leaving her parents behind in the Kyiv region. “With this family, I feel like I’m with my family,” she says. I realise it’s better to stay here. I’m in a safe place with good people. The Ukrainian government advised refugees not to go home over Christmas, because of fears the country’s energy infrastructure would not be able to deal with the demand, meaning many will spend the holiday apart from loved ones. Ukrainians traditionally celebrate Christmas on 7 January, according to the Julian calendar, but after Russia’s invasion the country’s Orthodox church is allowing its congregations to observe the 25 December date instead, in a move toward the west. Kashperenko, who worked in the media and as a copywriter in Ukraine, arrived in London after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled because she was worried about attacks on the capital and being forced to survive the winter without power. “I understood that Russia was going to destroy cities and energy systems,” she says. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has called for Iran, North Korea and Belarus to be held accountable for their alleged involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Podolyak’s tweet came a day after the White House accused North Korea of supplying arms to the private Russian mercenary firm the Wagner Group to help bolster Moscow’s troops in Ukraine. Kyiv has accused Tehran of supplying thousands of its drones to Moscow, which used them in deadly attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. After initially denying the presence of Iranian drones in Ukraine, the Tehran government has admitted that it had supplied a “small number” of the unmanned aircraft to Russia months before Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Petro Andryushchenko accused the occupying authorities of attempting to cover up the Russian bombing of the theatre, which was being used as an air raid shelter when it was hit on 16 March. An investigation by Amnesty International into the Mariupol theatre strike concluded that Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there. Video posted on social media appears to show diggers demolishing the last remaining walls of the theatre. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. The Russian occupying authorities were planning to leave the front of the theatre intact and destroy the rest of the structure, to build a new theatre “on the bones of Mariupol’s people”, Andryushchenko said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it had supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the US for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. The Canadian government said Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The Canadian government has condemned reports that North Korea has supplied battlefield missiles and rockets to the Wagner Group, a private Russian mercenary company, for use in Ukraine. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”, Canada’s foreign ministry said. Mélanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, said in a statement: We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place. The Wagner group’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied the White House’s accusation as “gossip and speculation”. North Korea’s foreign ministry also denied it had supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner. If one battle more than any other has defined the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine, it is the three-month siege of Mariupol’s steelworks this spring, and the harrowing experience of its last defenders. Holed up in Azovstal, one of Europe’s largest metal-producing plants, hundreds of outnumbered, outgunned, wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers, and more than 1,000 civilians, resisted one of Moscow’s fiercest military attacks for more than 80 days. “No one came out of there unchanged,” says Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name. They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out. Soon after the Russian invasion in late February, Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as “apocalyptic”. The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 22,000 people died during the fighting. Some survivors took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks, an industrial site covering an area of about four square miles, including a network of underground tunnels. With the civilians were about 3,000 soldiers, many of whom were members of the notorious Azov brigade, which, at its inception in 2014, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, but for President Vladimir Putin it was the perfect propaganda opportunity to convince the public that his narrative about the “nazification” of Ukraine was true, and that his army would hunt them down like rats. Never would Putin have imagined that the last defenders of Mariupol would defy his plan for so long. Cut off from the world and low on food, the defenders of Azovstal were holed up in the tunnels of the steelworks for over two months while the Russians launched rockets and incendiary bombs at the site.

Canada condemned what it said were North Korean arms deliveries to Russia, saying Pyongyang’s transaction with the private military company the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. “We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place,” the Canadian foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, said in a statement. North Korea’s foreign ministry, in a statement, has denied that it has supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reported. Two civilians have been killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine this morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. In a post on Telegram, it said: According to the investigation, in the morning of December 23, two local residents of the city of Kherson were killed in another shelling by Russian military personnel. Residential buildings and critical infrastructure were damaged. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said Russian shelling of the Korabelnyi district in Kherson killed one person. The victim, a male, “sustained fatal mine blast injuries”, Tymoshenko wrote on Telegram. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin yesterday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. In March, Putin formally signed a law that would impose harsh jail terms for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, including calling the war by its name. But the Russian leader said at a news conference on Thursday: Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of a military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war. This is what we are striving for. Nikita Yuferev, an opposition councillor in St Petersburg, has asked prosecutors to investigate Putin for using the word “war”, and accused the president of breaking his own law. In an open letter, he asked the prosecutor general and interior minister to “hold (Putin) responsible under the law for spreading fake news about the actions of the Russian army”. He told Reuters that he knew his legal challenge would go nowhere, but he had filed it to expose the “mendacity” of the system. Yuferev said: It’s important for me to do this to draw attention to the contradiction and the injustice of these laws that he (Putin) adopts and signs but which he himself doesn’t observe. I think the more we talk about this, the more people will doubt his honesty, his infallibility, and the less support he will have. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, told the state-owned Tass news agency: The blast occurred in front of the entrance to Gorky Park. A car exploded. The causes and circumstances are being investigated. He described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, killing one person and injuring two others, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Moscow’s troops “shelled the territory of Kherson region 61 times. The invaders attacked peaceful settlements of the region with artillery, MLRS, mortars and tanks”, Yanushevych wrote in an update on Facebook. About half the strikes hit Kherson city, striking residential blocks, educational institutions and private houses, he said. A kindergarten was also impacted, he added. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Peskov told reporters: It can be stated that there is significant progress towards demilitarisation. The Russian president said yesterday that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations” – implying that Ukraine would ultimately be forced to cede territory in exchange for peace. He also dismissed US supplies of Patriot missiles to Ukraine as old and said Russia’s missile systems would be able to shoot it down. Putin said: The Patriot air defence is outdated. An antidote will always be found … Russia will knock down the Patriot system. The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with up to €2.5bn (£2.2bn) in aid in 2023, the Dutch government has announced. The money is earmarked for military assistance, work to recover critical infrastructure and to help investigations into possible war crimes, it said. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, vowed that his country would provide assistance “as long as Russia continues its war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed he had spoken with Rutte and thanked him for the €2.5bn aid. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has been quoted by the state-owned Tass news agency as saying that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”. Antonov was quoted comparing the state of US-Russia relations to an “ice age” and that it was hard to say when talks between the two sides could resume. Washington needed time “to realise the futility of its policy towards Moscow”, Antonov told the Russian state-run news agency. He said: Strictly speaking, today it is difficult to say when this dialogue - a dialogue on strategic stability - can be resumed. We did not freeze it, we did not declare a proxy war against the US, we did not throw the entire NATO military-industrial machinery into Ukrainian territory to fight the Russian Federation. The Kremlin yesterday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White house and Congress. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the latest US support package – which includes the highly-sought after Patriot missile defence system – was “not conducive to a speedy settlement”. As part of the US support package, Ukrainian troops will learn how to use the Patriot surface-to-air missile battery systems in Germany, and it will be several months before they can deploy it on the battlefield. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the main news stories of the day so far: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. A senior Russian diplomat has said talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the United States said on Friday that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been “effective” and would continue. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s ambassador to the United States said on Friday that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been “effective” and would continue.

Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A destroyed building in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. In early 2022, the Ukrainian photojournalist Evgeny Maloletka was covering violence in Kazakhstan when his attention turned back home: there were several reports signalling that Russia was preparing an invasion. He didn’t have to think twice: he knew he had to be back in his home country. By mid-January, he was already working on assignment for the Associated Press in the city of Kharkiv and the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where there was a growing tension among Russian proxies. Maloletka was based in Kharkiv, 25 miles from some of the tens of thousands of Russian troops massed at the border, as diplomatic efforts to find a solution continued. When Maloletka and the AP team estimated that the invasion was imminent, they moved to the city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine. They thought that if war broke out, Mariupol would be key because it was a strategic seaport. They were not wrong. South Korea’s foreign ministry said on Friday it condemns North Korea’s arms shipment to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, adding it supports the United States’ push to raise the issue at the UN security council. The White House said on Thursday North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to the Wagner Group to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia typically refers to foreign volunteers fighting with the Ukrainian army as “mercenaries”, and has convicted captured foreign fighters of acting as such, Reuters reports. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. The agency’s deputy chief executive and head of intelligence, John Moss, said crypto was no longer considered a “niche option” for criminal activity and had become more mainstream. “We are now seeing more traditional money laundering being displaced into cryptocurrency, particularly to send money offshore,” he said. Moss said Russian groups have been soliciting digital currency donations on social media to buy weapons, drones and armour for the conflict in Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s surprise visit to Washington – the Ukrainian president’s first overseas trip since the Russian invasion 300 days ago – started with a secretive train ride to Poland late on Tuesday. The next morning he arrived in the southern Polish city of Przemysl, where he was spotted at the train station, according to footage from private broadcaster TVN, along with the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, who accompanied him. Zelenskiy’s visit had been planned for days and organised in secret because of concerns about his safety, but details were tweeted on Tuesday by a reporter from US-based newsletter Punchbowl News. In Poland, Zelenskiy boarded a US government plane which landed at about noon EST on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland near Washington. He traveled by motorcade to Blair House, the presidential guest house along Pennsylvania Avenue, and after freshening up from his trip went to the nearby White House, where he was greeted by President Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden. The air raid warning for Mykolaiv has ended, local governor Vitalii Kim has said on Telegram. Back to North Korea: According to the White House, Wagner took delivery of infantry rockets and missiles from North Korea, though Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin denied the assertion as “gossip and speculation”, Reuters reports. “The DPRK remains unchanged in its principled stand on the issue of ‘arms transaction’ between the DPRK and Russia which has never happened,” the North Korean spokesperson said, adding it is the US that’s “bringing bloodshed and destruction to Ukraine by providing it with various kinds of lethal weapons”. DPRK are the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. “The Japanese media’s false report that the DPRK offered munitions to Russia is the most absurd red herring, which is not worth any comment or interpretation,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement carried by the KCNA. The White House said on Thursday the North has completed an initial arms delivery to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean foreign ministry statement did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reports. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours. It is 7.30 in Kyiv. Our top stories this morning: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. And in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, air raid sirens sounded early this morning, according to the region’s mayor, Vitalii Kim on Telegram. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing the US Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the president “for his help, his international leadership and his determination to win”. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to the joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying Washington’s continued support was key to ultimate victory. His trip to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said the US supply of Patriot missile systems to Kyiv would not contribute to settling the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and would not prevent Moscow from achieving its goals. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”.

The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said.",

                    "bodyText": "The European parliament has backed plans to label gas and nuclear energy as “green”, rejecting appeals from prominent Ukrainians and climate activists that the proposals are a gift to Vladimir Putin. One senior MEP said the vote was a “dark day for the climate”, while experts said the EU had set a dangerous precedent for countries to follow. The row began late last year with the leak of long-awaited details on the EU’s green investment guidebook, intended to help investors channel billions to the clean power transition. The European Commission decided some gas and nuclear projects could be included in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities, subject to certain conditions. Under the plans, gas can be classed as a sustainable investment if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low-carbon gases”. Nuclear power can be called green if a project promises to deal with radioactive waste. The plan could only be stopped by a majority of EU member states or members of the European parliament. With most EU governments in favour, attention turned to the European parliament, but on Wednesday MEPs failed to muster a blocking majority. Only 282 MEPs voted in favour of an amendment against the inclusion of gas and nuclear, falling short of the 353 votes needed to overturn the decision. Bas Eickhout, the vice-president of the European parliament’s environment committee, said it was “dark day for the climate and energy transition”. The veteran Dutch MEP, who led the parliament in intra-EU negotiations on the taxonomy regulation, said the EU was “sending a disastrous signal to investors and the rest of the world” that it recognised fossil gas and nuclear as sustainable investments. “By clearing the way for this delegated act, the EU will have unreliable and greenwashed conditions for green investments in the energy sector,” he said. Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: “I am in shock. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war paid for by climate-heating fossil fuels and the European parliament just voted to boost billions of funding to fossil gas from Russia. How in the world is that in line with Europe’s stance to protect our planet and stand with Ukraine?” Johanne Schroeten, a policy adviser at the E3G climate thinktank, said: “Vested interests seem to have gotten the upper hand. The EU has now set a dangerous precedent of low ambition for other countries and jurisdictions to follow.” The deal came after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, promised Emmanuel Macron that France could have the green seal of approval for nuclear projects, which prompted gas-consuming countries to demand a similar concession. Campaigners are now vowing legal action. WWF said that with its fellow NGO Client Earth it would “explore all potential avenues for further action to stop this greenwashing and protect the credibility of the whole EU taxonomy”. Two anti-nuclear states, Austria and Luxembourg, have already announced they will take the commission to the European court of justice. But the proposals have powerful backers. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, tweeted that he welcomed the “positive results”, adding: “I am glad that Romania’s constant efforts on considering gas and nuclear as part of progressive decarbonisation were reflected in the EP’s final decision.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation intended for technical issues. Critics are now asking how such highly controversial plans could be passed through a form of lawmaking with few hurdles and less scrutiny. Activist fears were fuelled when Russia’s energy minister, Nikolai Shulginov, said the EU’s green taxonomy offered “a range of opportunities”. Speaking to the Energy Intelligence website before his country’s invasion of Ukraine, he said the inclusion of natural gas in the green taxonomy was evidence that the EU had realised it had made “a slight mistake” on the green transition. Since the invasion, the EU executive has set out plans to phase out Russian gas, but member states have not fixed a deadline to stop gas imports, unlike Russian oil and coal. The Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun tweeted: “Putin is rubbing his hands with glee today,” adding that the MEPs who had voted for or abstained on the inclusion of gas and nuclear in thegreen taxonomy had handed the Russian president “huge gifts”. She said: “I thank the brave 278 MEPs who objected. It wasn’t enough, but we won’t stop fighting.” • This article was amended on 6 July 2022 to clarify that while some prominent Ukrainian politicians came out against the EU vote on the green taxonomy, this was not the position of the state of Ukraine.",

But here are some of the ideas on the table, in terms of tax rises and spending cuts, and the likelihood of them being implemented.</p> <h2>Stealth tax increases</h2> <p>Perhaps the easiest tax rise a government can make: fail to upgrade tax band thresholds in line with inflation, or at all, and the extra receipts could run into the billions. The most likely are income tax thresholds, which will bring the greatest extra income. Among the levies forecast to be subject to “fiscal drag”, as it is also known, are inheritance tax, capital gains tax and dividend tax relief.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Would not be popular with low-tax Tories, but after the implosion of Liz Truss’s fiscal plan there is more tolerance than normal for such ideas.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>There is big money at stake. While a freeze in the inheritance tax “nil-rate band” from 2025-26 to 2027-28, would raise an additional £500m, the Treasury would gain £30bn from high inflation should Hunt extend a freeze on income tax bands.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> 4/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562Ex03w0IpfXrI\" data-alt=\"4/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562Ex03w0IpfXrI\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Cuts to capital spending</h2> <p>One of the temptations in cancelling or trimming big projects is that you can write billions off the government balance sheet with a few taps of the keyboard. Furthermore, you are getting rid of something that does not yet exist, and so could be easily forgotten by voters. Projects reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/04/all-capital-spending-under-review-uk-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement\">in the Treasury’s crosshairs</a> include the Sizewell C nuclear power station and elements of HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Potentially toxic, especially among MPs whose areas are affected, who will argue that long-term growth and productivity will be hurt by such cuts.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>Tempting though it may be when tens of billions of pounds can be saved<strong>, </strong>delaying or cancelling big infrastructure projects, especially if they reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels, will be a big blow to the future productivity and competitiveness of the British economy.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of some cuts:</strong> 4/5.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562Ex03w0IpfXrI\" data-alt=\"4/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562Ex03w0IpfXrI\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Of scrapping a major project:</strong> 2/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\" data-alt=\"2/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Real-terms cuts to benefits or pensions</h2> <p>With working-age benefits in Great Britain costing nearly £88bn a year, and spending on pensions and pension-age benefits being north of £110bn, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/26/rishi-sunak-delays-fiscal-statement-until-17-november\">savings are obvious</a> if either or both are uprated by, say, 5% rather than the current inflation level of nearer 10%. While broadly similar in approach to a stealth tax rise, it would be much more noticeable and controversial.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Tricky, which is why there has been much speculation that Hunt will increase both by inflation. But the savings cannot be ignored.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>For pensions, limiting the annual increase to the rise in earnings would save £6bn in each of the next two financial years, while working-age benefits would be £7bn lower than if they were linked to rises in inflation.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> 2/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\" data-alt=\"2/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Some sort of increase to the top rate of tax</h2> <p>Weeks after Kwasi Kwarteng announced the abolition of the 45p top rate of income tax in Truss’s ill-starred mini-budget, there is talk that the rate could now rise – though a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/09/jeremy-hunt-expected-increase-number-britons-paying-top-tax-rate\">much more likely outcome</a> is a lowering of the current £150,000 point at which people start to pay the top rate, potentially by a significant sum.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Kwarteng and Truss hailed the abolition of the 45p rate as removing a tax on aspiration, and some Tory MPs will deeply dislike such a move by Hunt. But as Truss found out, cutting taxes for the rich is not vastly popular elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>There are only modest gains for the Treasury from dragging more people into the 45p rate of tax. When the annual receipts from all taxpayers above £150,000 is about £2bn a year, shifting the threshold will raise only hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood of a lower threshold:</strong> 3/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562cT8rtyPPi0mX\" data-alt=\"3/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562cT8rtyPPi0mX\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Expanded windfall tax</h2> <p>Between campaigning to become prime minister and beginning her brief time in No 10, Truss changed her mind on Sunak’s windfall tax for energy firms, which she had initially condemned as a disincentive to invest. The version implemented under Sunak had significant opt-outs for new investments in fossil fuels, meaning Shell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/27/shell-doubles-its-profits-to-95bn\">paid nothing</a> despite £26bn in profits. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/28/windfall-tax-must-change-in-face-of-excessive-oil-profits-alok-sharma-says\">is among those</a> who have called for a revised version.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Sunak has, like Truss, warned against a Labour-style windfall tax as a drag on enterprise. Much like Truss, if he does make a U-turn then it is likely to be quite popular, beyond some Tory MPs. But it doesn’t feel very Sunak-like.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>There is no evidence that energy firms will cut investment if they are forced to give up some of their windfall gains. A broader tax on the industry with fewer opt-outs could see receipts increase from £5bn to £10bn.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> 2/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\" data-alt=\"2/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Delaying the cap in social care</h2> <p>This was, however imperfect in outcome, one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/07/what-has-boris-johnson-announced-social-care-plan\">the flagship policies</a> of Boris Johnson, and was due to come into force in October 2023. Some reports say Sunak wants to delay this for two years, and possibly permanently, saving up to £2bn a year. This would, however, mark yet another failure to get to grips with one of the UK’s most pressing chronic policy problems.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Likely to cause a storm among Tory voters and thus MPs, given that the cap’s ambition of preventing older people from needing to sell their homes to pay for care disproportionately helps people in better-off areas.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>Proposals for a now scrapped rise of 1.25 percentage points in national insurance contributions were to pay for increased health spending and more cash for social care, with a cap on care costs. NHS funding is secure, but social care looks like losing out again, even though older and disabled people will find themselves in hospital for longer than they need, increasing NHS bills.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> 3/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562cT8rtyPPi0mX\" data-alt=\"3/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-6562cT8rtyPPi0mX\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Changes to non-domiciled tax status</h2> <p>While entirely abolishing the ability of people with overseas tax jurisdiction to avoid paying UK taxes on their income – something enjoyed by Sunak’s wife for a period – seems unlikely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/03/non-dom-tax-breaks-being-reviewed-by-the-treasury-in-effort-to-raise-revenue\">there is speculation</a> about fairly significant changes, such as cutting the permitted duration from 15 to five years, potentially raising £1.6bn a year.</p> <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Not likely to worry voters, but it could alarm plenty of non-dom Tory donors, which is a demographic the party very much does not want to fall out with.</p> <p><strong>Fiscal impact: </strong>Some workers brought in from abroad claim non-dom status. They fill vacant, low-paid posts but deny the exchequer tax receipts. The difficulties separating the good non-dom from the bad has usually scuppered changes.</p> <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> 2/5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\" data-alt=\"2/5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/11/archive-zip/giv-65621c0G3czCL0p3\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Increases to council tax</h2> <p>Not directly a Treasury tax rise, as this would be done by local authorities.

Stealth tax increases Perhaps the easiest tax rise a government can make: fail to upgrade tax band thresholds in line with inflation, or at all, and the extra receipts could run into the billions. The most likely are income tax thresholds, which will bring the greatest extra income. Among the levies forecast to be subject to “fiscal drag”, as it is also known, are inheritance tax, capital gains tax and dividend tax relief. Political impact: Would not be popular with low-tax Tories, but after the implosion of Liz Truss’s fiscal plan there is more tolerance than normal for such ideas. Fiscal impact: There is big money at stake. While a freeze in the inheritance tax “nil-rate band” from 2025-26 to 2027-28, would raise an additional £500m, the Treasury would gain £30bn from high inflation should Hunt extend a freeze on income tax bands. Likelihood: 4/5 Cuts to capital spending One of the temptations in cancelling or trimming big projects is that you can write billions off the government balance sheet with a few taps of the keyboard. Furthermore, you are getting rid of something that does not yet exist, and so could be easily forgotten by voters. Projects reportedly in the Treasury’s crosshairs include the Sizewell C nuclear power station and elements of HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. Political impact: Potentially toxic, especially among MPs whose areas are affected, who will argue that long-term growth and productivity will be hurt by such cuts. Fiscal impact: Tempting though it may be when tens of billions of pounds can be saved, delaying or cancelling big infrastructure projects, especially if they reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels, will be a big blow to the future productivity and competitiveness of the British economy. Likelihood of some cuts: 4/5. Of scrapping a major project: 2/5 Real-terms cuts to benefits or pensions With working-age benefits in Great Britain costing nearly £88bn a year, and spending on pensions and pension-age benefits being north of £110bn, the savings are obvious if either or both are uprated by, say, 5% rather than the current inflation level of nearer 10%. While broadly similar in approach to a stealth tax rise, it would be much more noticeable and controversial. Political impact: Tricky, which is why there has been much speculation that Hunt will increase both by inflation. But the savings cannot be ignored. Fiscal impact: For pensions, limiting the annual increase to the rise in earnings would save £6bn in each of the next two financial years, while working-age benefits would be £7bn lower than if they were linked to rises in inflation. Likelihood: 2/5 Some sort of increase to the top rate of tax Weeks after Kwasi Kwarteng announced the abolition of the 45p top rate of income tax in Truss’s ill-starred mini-budget, there is talk that the rate could now rise – though a much more likely outcome is a lowering of the current £150,000 point at which people start to pay the top rate, potentially by a significant sum. Political impact: Kwarteng and Truss hailed the abolition of the 45p rate as removing a tax on aspiration, and some Tory MPs will deeply dislike such a move by Hunt. But as Truss found out, cutting taxes for the rich is not vastly popular elsewhere. Fiscal impact: There are only modest gains for the Treasury from dragging more people into the 45p rate of tax. When the annual receipts from all taxpayers above £150,000 is about £2bn a year, shifting the threshold will raise only hundreds of millions of pounds. Likelihood of a lower threshold: 3/5 Expanded windfall tax Between campaigning to become prime minister and beginning her brief time in No 10, Truss changed her mind on Sunak’s windfall tax for energy firms, which she had initially condemned as a disincentive to invest. The version implemented under Sunak had significant opt-outs for new investments in fossil fuels, meaning Shell paid nothing despite £26bn in profits. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, is among those who have called for a revised version. Political impact: Sunak has, like Truss, warned against a Labour-style windfall tax as a drag on enterprise. Much like Truss, if he does make a U-turn then it is likely to be quite popular, beyond some Tory MPs. But it doesn’t feel very Sunak-like. Fiscal impact: There is no evidence that energy firms will cut investment if they are forced to give up some of their windfall gains. A broader tax on the industry with fewer opt-outs could see receipts increase from £5bn to £10bn. Likelihood: 2/5 Delaying the cap in social care This was, however imperfect in outcome, one of the flagship policies of Boris Johnson, and was due to come into force in October 2023. Some reports say Sunak wants to delay this for two years, and possibly permanently, saving up to £2bn a year. This would, however, mark yet another failure to get to grips with one of the UK’s most pressing chronic policy problems. Political impact: Likely to cause a storm among Tory voters and thus MPs, given that the cap’s ambition of preventing older people from needing to sell their homes to pay for care disproportionately helps people in better-off areas. Fiscal impact: Proposals for a now scrapped rise of 1.25 percentage points in national insurance contributions were to pay for increased health spending and more cash for social care, with a cap on care costs. NHS funding is secure, but social care looks like losing out again, even though older and disabled people will find themselves in hospital for longer than they need, increasing NHS bills. Likelihood: 3/5 Changes to non-domiciled tax status While entirely abolishing the ability of people with overseas tax jurisdiction to avoid paying UK taxes on their income – something enjoyed by Sunak’s wife for a period – seems unlikely, there is speculation about fairly significant changes, such as cutting the permitted duration from 15 to five years, potentially raising £1.6bn a year. Political impact: Not likely to worry voters, but it could alarm plenty of non-dom Tory donors, which is a demographic the party very much does not want to fall out with. Fiscal impact: Some workers brought in from abroad claim non-dom status. They fill vacant, low-paid posts but deny the exchequer tax receipts. The difficulties separating the good non-dom from the bad has usually scuppered changes. Likelihood: 2/5 Increases to council tax Not directly a Treasury tax rise, as this would be done by local authorities. But with grants to councils set to be frozen, one idea being considered is allowing council tax to go up by 3% or more without a referendum, as is needed currently. Political impact: This would be unpopular, but as with much of George Osborne’s 2010-era austerity, outsourcing the pain to councils is tempting for the Treasury. Fiscal impact: With councils claiming they face a £15bn shortfall going into the budget from Osborne’s austerity measures, being told again they can only recoup their losses from higher council tax bills would cripple many services. Likelihood: 3/5 • This article was amended on 17 November 2022 to remove an unsubstantiated reference to “many of the nurses brought in from abroad” claiming non-dom status.",

He repeated warnings that Russia was preparing for strikes in the Donbas region and Kharkiv. In a video address late on Friday, he said Russian troops in the north of the country were slowly pulling back. Zelenskiy also said that Russia was trying to conscript troops from Crimea, but said that being drafted to fight in Ukraine was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He warned their families: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them.” Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials. Russia says Ukrainian helicopters attacked an oil storage facility in Belgorod, Russia, about 16 miles from the border and close to Kharkiv, destroying fuel tanks. Ukrainian officials have denied their forces were involved. The UK Ministry of Defence says the destruction of oil tanks at a depot in the Russian city of Belgorod means probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies to invading forces. It will likely add more strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains. Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkhiv may be particularly affected. The US department of defense will provide an additional $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, to include laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, earlier spoke with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today and discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war”, Blinken said. The US State Department said Washington will continue to provide support to Ukraine and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia following a report that said Britain was concerned the US, France and Germany will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal. The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia. Zelenskiy also said more than 3,000 people had been led to safety from the besieged city of Mariupol. More than 6,000 in total had been rescued from Mariupol, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had been unable to reach the city but will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. The Hollywood actor Sean Penn has called for a billionaire to come forward and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 aircraft for Ukraine in an unlikely attempt to tip the scales against the Russian invaders in the five-week-old war. European governments have more time to figure out how they are going to act on Russia’s demand to pay for Russia gas in rubles after the Kremlin said today that it would not immediately halt gas supplies Around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the mayor of Slavutych, Yuri Fomichev, said.",

The bill – the Inflation Reduction Act – was virtually dead in the water before a last-minute turnaround by the conservative West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin saw it suddenly revived. It then endured another round of political horse-trading as it navigated the choppy waters of a 50-50 split Senate. But, being carried by a tie-breaking vote from Biden’s vice-president, Kamala Harris, it emerged mostly intact. And, after a vote in the House later this week, it is set to land on Biden’s Oval Office desk. Here is what’s in it and what it means: Overview The estimated $740bn package is full of Democratic priorities. Those include capping prescription drug costs at $2,000 out of pocket for seniors, helping Americans pay for private health insurance, and what Democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight the climate crisis: $375bn over the decade. Almost half the money raised, $300bn, will go toward paying down federal deficits. It’s paid for largely with new corporate taxes, including a 15% minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don’t skip paying any taxes at all, as well as projected federal savings from lower Medicare drug costs. It’s not at all clear the 755-page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures, though millions of Americans are expected to see some relief in healthcare and other costs. What does it mean for Biden? For Biden, the bill’s passage delivers a much-needed domestic win at a time when his popularity has sunk and key midterm elections loom in November. Though the bill has been stripped of much of his original ambitious program, it remains a major achievement. Biden can now go to the polls and portray himself as a president able to get things done even in the difficult political circumstances of a deeply divided country. Climate crisis The bill would invest nearly $375bn over the decade in climate-fighting strategies, including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles. It’s broken down to include $60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and $30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar, seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. The bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as ExxonMobil have invested millions of dollars to advance. The bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters. A late addition pushed by Senator Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado would designate $4bn to combat a mega-drought in the west, including conservation efforts in the Colorado river basin, on which nearly 40 million Americans rely for drinking water. For consumers, there are tax breaks as incentives to go green. One is a 10-year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar. There are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles, including a $4,000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and $7,500 for new ones. In all, Democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and “would represent the single biggest climate investment in US history, by far”. Prescription drug costs Launching a long-sought goal, the bill would allow the Medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving the federal government $288bn over the 10-year budget window. Those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications, including a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies. Seniors would also have insulin prices capped at $35 a dose. A provision to extend that price cap on insulin to Americans with private health insurances was out of line with Senate budget rules and Republicans stripped it from the final bill. Health insurance The bill would extend the subsidies provided during the pandemic to help some Americans who buy health insurance on their own. Under earlier pandemic relief, the extra help was set to expire this year. But the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years, lowering insurance premiums for people who are buying their own healthcare policies. How is it paid for? The biggest revenue-raiser in the bill is a new 15% minimum tax on corporations that earn more than $1bn in annual profits. The new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than $258bn over the decade.

                    "bodyText": "President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” and warned that the threat of nuclear war is “on the rise”. In an address to his human rights council, Russia’s leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss “domestic security”, and Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds.",

All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia.</p> <p>Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan.</p> <p>Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”.</p> <p>In a Wednesday evening <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/cogo-tizhnya-mayemo-horoshi-novini-z-harkivshini-dumayu-kozh-77569\">address</a>, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south.</p> <p>One of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Tuesday night that “lightning-fast changes are taking place” in the Kharkiv region, in parallel to the southern offensive in the Kherson region announced by Ukraine’s military last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/09/archive-zip/giv-6562ZR6uCPzKLGz5/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/09/archive-zip/giv-6562ZR6uCPzKLGz5/\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Map</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said that Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield.</p> <p>“We’ll see how things pan out,” said under secretary of defense for policy Colin Kahl. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.”</p> <p>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka (less than 2 miles north-west of Balakliia) on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers.<br><br>Without specifying any locations, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday that a “counterattack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”.</p> <p>Ukraine’s military did give some confirmation of the alleged offensive on Wednesday, claiming Ukraine’s army shot down a Russian military Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft near Volokhiv Yar, a town about 12 miles from Balakliia.</p> <p>Ukraine for a long time spoke openly of its intent to launch a large-scale southern offensive in the Kherson region, forcing Russia to transfer some of its most elite units from the east to Kherson.</p> <p>According to the ISW, this has opened up opportunities for Ukraine to launch attacks near Kharkiv. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” the thinktank wrote late on Tuesday.</p> <p>Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the Ukrainian attack indicated that Russian forces near Kharkiv were stretched.</p> <p>“Russia doesn’t have strong reserves in this area that could be sent quickly to plug gaps and reinforce key towns. Ukraine may have a numerical and armour superiority here.”</p> <p>The Russian government and its defence ministry have not commented on Ukraine’s alleged offensives.</p> <p>Speaking at an economic forum in the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/putin-threatens-to-tear-up-fragile-ukraine-grain-deal-in-bellicose-speech\">said Russia had not lost anything</a> as a result of its military campaign in Ukraine.</p> <p>A number of prominent pro-Kremlin bloggers volleyed criticism at the Russian authorities after Ukraine’s latest offensive.</p> <p>Igor Girkin, a Russian ultra-nationalist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-criminal-charges-ukraine-russia\">former military leader</a> for the Russian-backed republics in eastern Ukraine, said the outskirts of Balakliia were defended by poorly equipped mobilised forces from the Donbas region who “didn’t know how to use available heavy weapons”. He added that Ukraine also took control of the settlement of Volokhiv Yar overnight.</p> <p>Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin war blogger, on Wednesday denounced the Russian authorities for hiding “bad news”. “We need to start doing something about the system where our leadership doesn’t like to talk about bad news and their subordinates don’t want to upset their bosses,” he said.</p> <p>Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv came as Andrei Turchak, head of Russia’s ruling party, proposed to hold referendums on joining Russia in occupied territories on 4 November, when Russia celebrates its National Unity day.</p> <p>“It would be right and symbolic to hold referendums on this very day,” Turchak wrote on his Telegram channel, the most concrete sign yet that Russia is planning to go ahead with annexing Ukrainian territories.</p> <p>Also on Wednesday, a new <a href=\"https://www.info-res.org/post/danger-zone-how-russia-is-risking-nuclear-disaster-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant\">report</a> by the London-based Centre for Information Resilience’s Eyes on Russia said it was highly likely that Russian forces shelled the Russian-occupied Enerhodar, the satellite town of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.</p> <p>The centre’s investigators also verified previously published footage of a rocket firing from next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – controlled by Russia – as well as images of Russian equipment at the plant. <br><br>After Russian forces took control of Enerhodar and the nuclear plant in March, the two sides have traded blame over the shelling in both areas. Ukraine has said Russia is carrying out false-flag operations to blame Ukrainian forces, while Russia has said the attacks are carried out by Ukraine.<br><br>The centre’s investigators geo-located footage showing the impact of shelling in front of a building in Enerhodar. The footage showed a larger quantity of dirt on the left side of the crater, indicating that the shell came from the right side of the camera, stated the report.<br><br>The investigators then traced the potential trajectory of the rocket and concluded that it was launched from the southern side of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia region, an area under Russian control since February. <br></p>",

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan. Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. One of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Tuesday night that “lightning-fast changes are taking place” in the Kharkiv region, in parallel to the southern offensive in the Kherson region announced by Ukraine’s military last week. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said that Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” said under secretary of defense for policy Colin Kahl. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka (less than 2 miles north-west of Balakliia) on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Without specifying any locations, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday that a “counterattack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”. Ukraine’s military did give some confirmation of the alleged offensive on Wednesday, claiming Ukraine’s army shot down a Russian military Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft near Volokhiv Yar, a town about 12 miles from Balakliia. Ukraine for a long time spoke openly of its intent to launch a large-scale southern offensive in the Kherson region, forcing Russia to transfer some of its most elite units from the east to Kherson. According to the ISW, this has opened up opportunities for Ukraine to launch attacks near Kharkiv. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” the thinktank wrote late on Tuesday. Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the Ukrainian attack indicated that Russian forces near Kharkiv were stretched. “Russia doesn’t have strong reserves in this area that could be sent quickly to plug gaps and reinforce key towns. Ukraine may have a numerical and armour superiority here.” The Russian government and its defence ministry have not commented on Ukraine’s alleged offensives. Speaking at an economic forum in the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia had not lost anything as a result of its military campaign in Ukraine. A number of prominent pro-Kremlin bloggers volleyed criticism at the Russian authorities after Ukraine’s latest offensive. Igor Girkin, a Russian ultra-nationalist and former military leader for the Russian-backed republics in eastern Ukraine, said the outskirts of Balakliia were defended by poorly equipped mobilised forces from the Donbas region who “didn’t know how to use available heavy weapons”. He added that Ukraine also took control of the settlement of Volokhiv Yar overnight. Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin war blogger, on Wednesday denounced the Russian authorities for hiding “bad news”. “We need to start doing something about the system where our leadership doesn’t like to talk about bad news and their subordinates don’t want to upset their bosses,” he said. Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv came as Andrei Turchak, head of Russia’s ruling party, proposed to hold referendums on joining Russia in occupied territories on 4 November, when Russia celebrates its National Unity day. “It would be right and symbolic to hold referendums on this very day,” Turchak wrote on his Telegram channel, the most concrete sign yet that Russia is planning to go ahead with annexing Ukrainian territories. Also on Wednesday, a new report by the London-based Centre for Information Resilience’s Eyes on Russia said it was highly likely that Russian forces shelled the Russian-occupied Enerhodar, the satellite town of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The centre’s investigators also verified previously published footage of a rocket firing from next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – controlled by Russia – as well as images of Russian equipment at the plant. After Russian forces took control of Enerhodar and the nuclear plant in March, the two sides have traded blame over the shelling in both areas. Ukraine has said Russia is carrying out false-flag operations to blame Ukrainian forces, while Russia has said the attacks are carried out by Ukraine. The centre’s investigators geo-located footage showing the impact of shelling in front of a building in Enerhodar. The footage showed a larger quantity of dirt on the left side of the crater, indicating that the shell came from the right side of the camera, stated the report. The investigators then traced the potential trajectory of the rocket and concluded that it was launched from the southern side of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia region, an area under Russian control since February.",

                    "bodyText": "The Bank of England will lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn to deal with soaring market prices amid fears of another wave of energy company collapses. Prime minister Liz Truss, on her third day in office, said she wanted to make sure energy companies have the cash they need to buy energy if prices jump. Reports this week said British Gas owner Centrica was in talks with banks to secure extra cash as Vladimir Putin continues to choke off Europe’s supply of gas. The bailout fund for energy companies was announced alongside a suspension of the energy price cap, which Truss replaced with an “energy price guarantee” to freeze household energy bills for two years. The government will also offer “equivalent support” for six months for businesses – most of whom have not received any financial aid to address the energy crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies who use the Bank of England’s energy markets financing scheme will have to sign up to a “wider set of conditions”, the Treasury said. During the coronavirus pandemic support schemes some companies were banned from paying dividends after receiving loans. Amid warnings energy markets were facing a “Lehman” moment, when a liquidity crunch precipitated the global banking crisis, the government said the scheme would provide “last resort” financing. The money will essentially guarantee that energy suppliers can pay for any power they commit to buying in the wholesale markets, as well as letting them insure themselves to protect against price rises. Surging prices have prompted ballooning calls for collateral for energy trades, forcing even the largest suppliers to turn to their banks to increase their overdrafts. The governments of Sweden and Finland stepped in with similar measures at the weekend, with the Finnish economy minister saying: “This has had the ingredients for a kind of a Lehman Brothers of energy industry.” Since the start of the energy crisis more than 30 suppliers have collapsed. That has left energy customers concentrated with bigger firms, whose collapse would probably cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. Some analysts believe that the largest collapse so far, of Bulb, could cost more than £4bn. Officials are scrambling to draw up details of the scheme, but the government on Thursday said it may only be able to reveal a start date by the end of October. It is understood that further details of the scheme will be published next week. Tim Speed, an energy specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau said: “A £40bn liquidity fund provides some comfort for energy suppliers, but the support needs to start with immediate effect to stabilise the market. Further supplier casualties will end up costing consumers more.” In an indication of the hurried design of Truss’s plan, the government said it would also not be able to provide details until next week of how financial support will be delivered to households or businesses. Nevertheless, business leaders welcomed the scale of the ambition displayed in a package estimated to cost as much as £100bn for the first year alone. Rain Newtown-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, the UK’s largest business lobby group, welcomed “bold and decisive action” that will “limit some of the damaging hardship faced by families this winter and for the wider economy”. “Big spending now needs big plans to recapture sustainable economic growth,” she added. As well as support measures over the next few months, Truss also promised to rewrite the rules governing how customers buy electricity and gas – throwing the future of regulator Ofgem into doubt. Those policies included: A review of the UK’s energy regulation that promises to deliver “fundamental reforms to the structure and regulation” An energy supply taskforce, led by Madelaine McTernan, who currently heads the government’s vaccines taskforce, that will seek to agree long-term contracts for energy supply at steady prices A review of the UK’s 2050 net zero target to ensure it is “not placing undue burdens on businesses or consumers” McTernan, a banker who held senior roles at Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers before entering government in 2017, will also look to strike better deals with solar, wind and nuclear power generators, who have seen their incomes rise because the price of electricity is pegged to the price of gas. Truss announced the government would be adopting an industry proposal to replace current contracts for renewable energy with a contracts for difference regime, which caps returns and should deliver a lower fixed price, over a longer term. Economists said the package was likely to soften the impact of the long recession forecast for the UK as the energy crisis caused inflation to soar. The plan is expected to match – and in many cases exceed – the actions of other countries facing similar predicaments. It was reported on Thursday that Germany plans to give discounts to households and businesses on a certain amount of power in its €65bn plan. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the promise of bills support for the first time during the crisis was “a huge relief for millions of small businesses”. However, he said Truss offered “not enough information, yet, for them to plan”. McTague also cautioned against a “cliff-edge after six months” if, as planned, the government withdraws support for companies. The government should have a “broad, realistic and fair” definition of which sectors are “vulnerable”, he said. The business support is expected to focus on subsidies for wholesale gas prices. The government has promised to keep prices lower for all businesses for six months, and will consider how to cut back support to certain sectors in a review in three months’ time. Households will see costs frozen at an average of £2,500 a year, a measure that is expected to support consumer spending. The government said it would also help reduce inflation, curbing the headline rate – which reached 10.1% in July – by four or five percentage points. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, the largest UK domestic energy supplier, said it was a “bold customer support package” that “will bring immediate relief to hard pressed households”. Paul Dales of Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the package would “reduce inflation and limit the size of the recession”, but that it would also lead to higher interest rates and higher government debt. Energy companies called for the government to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Michael Lewis, chief executive of supplier E.ON UK, said the UK needed to make more “cheap, clean electricity” and “reduce our fossil fuel use”. However, he said he was “disappointed not to see a greater commitment to energy efficiency as a long-term solution to the current crisis, and as the foundation stone of that cleaner, greener future.” Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, called for “a three-pronged attack to tackle the issue at source by weaning the country off fossil fuels, doubling down on cheap, clean renewables and, importantly, decoupling electricity prices from gas.”",

                    "bodyText": "The European Union’s executive body has urged member states to slash their gas consumption by 15%, as it warned that a complete shutdown of Russian supplies was “likely”. The EU has been scrambling to wean itself off Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine, but is alarmed about a potential energy crisis this winter. In response to EU support for Kyiv, the Kremlin has already stopped or reduced gas supplies to a dozen EU member states and is expected to send lower volumes of gas to Germany when the Nord Stream 1 pipeline reopens on Thursday after scheduled maintenance works. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the Kremlin had kept gas storage as low as possible before the invasion and gone on to cut supplies. “Russia is blackmailing us, Russia is using energy as a weapon,” she told reporters. “It is a likely scenario that there is a full cut-off of Russian gas and that would hit the whole European Union. A gas crisis in the single market, our economic powerhouse, will affect every single member state.” Presenting the commission’s winter plan on Wednesday, she proposed that between 1 August to 31 March 2023 there should be a voluntary reduction in gas use to 15% below the average for that period over the past five years. Under the proposals, if there is a drastic reduction or complete shutdown of Russian gas, Brussels could declare an EU-wide emergency and introduce legally binding reduction targets. While emergency measures would fall on industry, EU governments are being asked to step up campaigns encouraging consumers to save energy, by turning down thermostats, shortening showers and not leaving appliances on standby. Frans Timmermans, the EU’s top official in charge of the European Green Deal, said consumers would remain protected, but could also do their bit. “Do we have to have air conditioning set at 20 degrees?” he asked. “[The temperature] could be higher, couldn’t it? Of course it might reduce a bit of our comfort, but it might also reduce a lot of our consumption.” The targets have to be agreed by EU member states, which are responsible for choosing their own energy mix. The call for mandatory gas savings could trigger a backlash from countries less exposed to Russian gas, which may blame other member states for building up a dangerous dependency. One senior EU diplomat suggested that Germany, which imported 50% of its gas from Russia before the war, could face some tough questions from countries that recall Berlin’s strictures on debt during the eurozone crisis. “So we have to pay for your past mistakes. Now remind me what you said about debt in the past,” the diplomat said, describing how the debate might play out, rather than expressing their country’s stance. EU energy ministers are to discuss the plan next Tuesday, but the Netherlands and Denmark have already signalled they might not be ready to agree the targets, because their parliaments need time to scrutinise the law.

It argues that early action to save energy combined with a milder winter could limit the economic hit to a 0.4% average reduction in GDP across the 27-country bloc. The International Monetary Fund, however, has made a bleaker forecast, suggesting the hardest-hit countries could see a GDP fall of 6%. Under the latest plan, member states are encouraged to look at switching to alternative fuels, even delaying the decision to phase out coal or nuclear power, although clean energy is prioritised. Social Democrat MEPs urged the EU to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies. “It would be extremely unfair if we make the most vulnerable among us, including low-income households and elderly persons, tighten their belts while energy companies with skyrocketing profits pay little or no share of the burden,” said Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch MEP. The EU has already pledged to end dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 at the latest, with a ban on 90% of Russian oil imports due to be complete by the end of the year. Since the invasion, the EU has ramped up supplies of liquified natural gas and pipeline gas from countries such as Norway, the US and the UK. It has also been criticised by human rights groups for an agreement signed this week with Azerbaijan to boost gas supplies via the southern gas corridor, a 2,200-mile (3,500km) pipeline connecting the EU via Turkey, Georgia and the resource-rich Caspian Sea.",

                    "bodyText": "Russia and Ukraine said they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war on each side in the latest of a series of such swaps. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the returned soldiers included dozens who had held out in the besieged Azovstal steelworks in city of Mariupol. Russia’s defence ministry said the freed Russian soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical care and psychological support. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexei Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap on Tuesday. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported.

Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year.

                    "bodyText": "Joe Biden landed in the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah to a tepid welcome from the Saudi crown prince whose country he once pledged to make a “pariah” on the world stage. While Saudi Arabia announced it would open its airspace to flights from Israel, making Biden the first US president to fly directly from Tel Aviv to the kingdom, expectations of further gains during his visit remained low. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told journalists onboard Air Force One not to expect any bilateral announcements in response to American demands that Saudi Arabia pump more oil to calm global energy markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia is keen to prove its independence from US interests as it increasingly courts Russia and China. “From the start, my aim was to reorient – but not rupture – relations with a country that’s been a strategic partner for 80 years,” Biden wrote in the Washington Post prior to his visit, sidestepping his pledge on the campaign trail to make Saudi Arabia “a pariah”, and the later release of a US intelligence report stating that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, “approved” an operation to capture and murder the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. “It’s a completely different Saudi Arabia, one that in many ways has modernised and opened up a bit, but is also seeing greater crackdowns – and the Biden administration is brutally aware of all this,” said Dina Esfandiary of the NGO Crisis Group. Biden’s visit means carefully stage-managing relations with Prince Mohammed, the Kingdom’s powerful de facto ruler, who observers say has the upper hand as Biden courts his goodwill at a time of rising global oil prices mounting a challenge to his presidency domestically. The two shared a fist bump on Biden’s arrival, although the president later warmly shook hands with the king, Salman bin Abdulaziz. At the start of the president’s Middle East trip, officials said he would avoid close contact such as shaking hands as a precaution against Covid. The US president is under intense pressure to repair the fragile relationship between two nations, one that traditionally relied on the kingdom liberally supplying oil to the global market in exchange for the US’s backing in areas of security and defence. This has increasingly shifted in recent years, exacerbated as the relationship between Biden and Prince Mohammed has soured and Saudi Arabia looks to Russia and China to diversify its interests. “The message from Saudi is you can’t tell us what to do, we’ll help you as far as it suits us but we won’t go against our own interests,” said Esfandiary. Cinzia Bianco, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. “The Saudi leadership has learned to do without seeking validation from the United States, and Bin Salman in particular – he’s learned to survive and maybe even thrive within the region and to some degree internationally, without getting validation from the US administration,” she said. Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said that, with the visit to Saudi Arabia, Biden was reneging on previous promises to prioritise human rights. “It’s a very huge backing down actually,” Cengiz told the Associated Press. “It’s heartbreaking and disappointing. And Biden will lose his moral authority by putting oil and expediency over principles and values.” Saudi Arabia’s recent cooperation with Russia has included an agreement for Rosatom, a Russian state company, to build a nuclear power plant in the kingdom, as well as signing an agreement last year to “explore ways to develop military to strengthen the military and defence cooperation” between the two countries according to the deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman. China is historically the largest importer of Saudi Arabian oil, while the kingdom has bought Chinese arms including drones and fighter aircraft. Last November, US intelligence agencies concluded that Saudi Arabia is manufacturing its own ballistic missiles with the help of China, according to satellite imagery. Bianco stressed that the US administration saw Biden’s visit as a vital opportunity to intervene and warm relations before Saudi Arabia moves ahead with Chinese and Russian deals that largely remain in their infancy. “The US administration sees an opportunity to undo all of that or take a step back and create some space,” she said. “There’s a lot on paper rather than in reality, and there’s still space for the administration to try to create some distance between Saudi Arabia, Russia and China.” Yet as Biden landed in Jeddah to discuss how to increase the global supply of oil in order to bring down prices, doubts persisted as to whether he would fly home with anything to show for his visit at all. Shortly before his arrival, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia had more than doubled its imports of Russian oil in order to free up more of its own crude for export, shunning demands for sanctions from the west while increasing profit margins amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Maybe the US administration had good intentions when it began setting up this trip, but ultimately it’s making them look bad – they’re losing the public relations war,” said Esfandiary. “It’s not clear that they’re going to make any gains, my sense is that everyone will walk away disappointed.”",

Russian authorities said they found vape cartridges in her possession that contained cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. She was sentenced on 4 August to nine years in a penal colony.</p> \n  <p>Her family has decried her detention as politically motivated, with many of her supporters raising concerns for her safety, in regards to her race and sexuality. Griner is married to a woman. The US has characterised Griner’s arrest and subsequent sentencing as a “wrongful detention”.</p> \n  <p>“President Biden has been clear that Brittney should be released immediately,” Jake Sullivan, national security advisor, said today. Sullivan called today’s rejected appeal “another sham judicial proceeding”.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

                    "bodyText": "The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: Ukraine has said that persistent Russian claims that Kyiv plans to detonate a dirty bomb made it look as though Moscow itself planned to conduct a false-flag operation, and that Ukraine has never had any plans to develop a dirty bomb. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference that experts from the UN nuclear watchdog would soon be arriving in Ukraine and receive full access, and he called on Moscow to demonstrate the same transparency as Ukraine, Reuters reported. The Donetsk oblast was hit hard in the past day, with at least 15 Russian strikes killing seven civilians and injuring three more. The Ukrainian national police said the strikes also destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. Further south, a car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTV in Russia-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people, including company employees, authorities said. While investigators are still looking into the blast, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. Police rescued an eight-year-old boy whose parents were killed in Russian shell strikes in Bakhmut, it has been reported. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Bohdan’s mother was seven months pregnant when she died “in the street”, along with his father. Ukrainian authorities are now estimating that Russian forces have lost nearly 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. Refugees who fled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should stay abroad this winter due to blackouts created by Moscow’s bombardment of critical energy infrastructure, a Ukrainian minister has said. In an interview broadcast on Ukrainian national television on Tuesday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told Ukrainians currently sheltering abroad that they should wait until spring before returning to Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said Russian assets and those of Russian oligarchs present a “huge pot of gold” that should be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “We must make sure that the offender pays for reconstruction. Russia should pay Ukraine war damages, war reparations,” Morawiecki said on Tuesday at a conference in Berlin working to build international support to finance Ukraine’s postwar rehabilitation. Russian president Vladimir Putin has addressed a new coordination council designed to boost support for an invasion now in its ninth month, Reuters reported. Putin set up the new council last week as he imposed martial law in four partly-occupied regions of Ukraine that he has declared part of Russia, where his forces have suffered several defeats by a resurgent Ukrainian army. The US Congressional Progressive Caucus withdrew a letter to the White House urging a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, chair Pramila Jayapal confirmed. “The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,” Jayapal said in a statement. Moscow was generally supportive of the idea of creating a secure zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna, told the TASS news agency on Tuesday. The European Commission urged European Union countries and companies to donate more money and equipment to support the energy sector in Ukraine, over a third of which has been destroyed by Russian missile and drone strikes. “What is at stake is the protection and wellbeing of thousands and tens of thousands of households, vulnerable people, children and elderly before this coming winter,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. The US Congressional Progressive Caucus withdrew a letter to the White House urging a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, chair Pramila Jayapal confirmed. “The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,” Jayapal said in a statement. She added: “The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting.” Refugees who fled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should stay abroad this winter due to blackouts created by Moscow’s bombardment of critical energy infrastructure, a Ukrainian minister has said. In an interview broadcast on Ukrainian national television on Tuesday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told Ukrainians currently sheltering abroad that they should wait until spring before returning to Ukraine. “I wanted to ask [them] not to return. We need to survive the winter,” she said. The European Commission urged European Union countries and companies to donate more money and equipment to support the energy sector in Ukraine, over a third of which has been destroyed by Russian missile and drone strikes. “What is at stake is the protection and wellbeing of thousands and tens of thousands of households, vulnerable people, children and elderly before this coming winter,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. Speaking after a meeting of energy ministers in Luxembourg, she said Ukrainian transformers, circuit breakers and power lines had been destroyed, causing outages. “It is urgent,” she told reporters. Russian president Vladimir Putin has addressed a new coordination council designed to boost support for an invasion now in its ninth month, Reuters reported. Putin set up the new council last week as he imposed martial law in four partly-occupied regions of Ukraine that he has declared part of Russia, where his forces have suffered several defeats by a resurgent Ukrainian army. His comments and those of some of the council members amounted to a tacit acknowledgement that Russia was not fully prepared for the resistance it has met in Ukraine, whose capital Kyiv it failed to seize at the outset of the war in February. Putin said increased coordination of government institutions and regions was necessary to manage the government’s work to produce more equipment for its forces and provide them with better medical and logistical support, though he did not explain in detail how this would work. “I have discussed many times with many of you the issues related to the need to update all the work to improve administrative procedures,” Putin told the council, made up of members of the government and regional leaders, in televised remarks. “Administrative reform is impossible without broader coordination between all departments: the economic bloc, the security bloc, the regions.” Police rescued an eight-year-old boy whose parents were killed in Russian shell strikes in Bakhmut, it has been reported. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Bohdan’s mother was seven months pregnant when she died “in the street”, along with his father. She tweeted: The boy was alone in the area, which is almost impossible to reach #StandWithUkraine Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said Russian assets and those of Russian oligarchs present a “huge pot of gold” that should be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “We must make sure that the offender pays for reconstruction. Russia should pay Ukraine war damages, war reparations,” Morawiecki said on Tuesday at a conference in Berlin working to build international support to finance Ukraine’s postwar rehabilitation. He also said Europe had been “to some extent, a paper tiger” and was much stronger than Russia. Ukraine has said that persistent Russian claims that Kyiv plans to detonate a dirty bomb made it look as though Moscow itself planned to conduct a false-flag operation, and that Ukraine has never had any plans to develop a dirty bomb. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference that experts from the UN nuclear watchdog would soon be arriving in Ukraine and receive full access, and he called on Moscow to demonstrate the same transparency as Ukraine, Reuters reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the country needs to speed up decision-making in relation to the military campaign in Ukraine. Speaking at the first meeting of a new coordination council to manage the Russian government’s work on the home front, Putin said increased coordination of government structures and regions was necessary, Reuters reported. John Hudson, a journalist with the Washington Post, has obtained the letter Russia sent to the UN security council on Ukrainian “dirty bombs”. He says it is “way out there”, highlighting how it includes scenarios about how Ukraine would produce a “dirty bomb” using its existing nuclear power plants. He also writes: The claims in the letter, which U.S. and Western officials call preposterous, say the Ukrainian government would detonate the dirty bomb and describe the subsequent explosion as the result of a Russian tactical nuclear weapon. Russian forces have been hitting the Donetsk oblast hard recently, taking aim in particular at the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas. In the last day, seven civilians were killed and three wounded amid five strikes on eight settlements. Here’s a look at the aftermath, as citizens stay behind to pick up the pieces, or evacuate in hopes of finding safety: A man who entered Norway as a Brazilian citizen is being held for four weeks under suspicion of being a Russian spy, according to a Norwegian broadcaster. Norwegian public broadcaster NRK is reporting that the country’s domestic security agency detained the man in the Arctic city of Tromø, according to the Associated Press. The man had been based at the Arctic University of Norway as “a Brazilian researcher” and would be expelled from the country, “because we believe he represents a threat to fundamental national interests”, Norwegian police security service deputy chief Hedvig Moe told NRK. The security service “is concerned that he may have acquired a network and information about Norway’s policy in the northern region”, Moe said. “Even if this network or the information bit by bit is not a threat to the security of the kingdom, we are worried that the information could be misused by Russia.” In a statement, Arctic University of Norway administrator Jørgen Fossland said the person in question was “a guest lecturer” at the school. The lecturer was apprehended Monday on his way to his job, NRK said. His attorney, Thomas Hansen, told the VG newspaper the man denies any wrongdoing. Moscow was generally supportive of the idea of creating a secure zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna, told the TASS news agency on Tuesday. Reuters is reporting that Ulyanov had responded to long-standing calls by the International Atomic Energy Agency to de-escalate the conflict near the plant. “The essence (of the IAEA proposal) in a nutshell is that you cannot shoot from the territory of the nuclear station and you cannot shoot at the station. Quite a reasonable idea, which we generally support. The question, as always, is in the details,” TASS quoted Ulyanov as saying. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been a place of contention for months now, with both sides accusing the other of launching attacks on it. Any sort of accident or mishap at the plant – Europe’s largest nuclear facility – would have widespread environmental consequences for the surrounding areas for years to come. A Russian court today rejected an appeal by US basketball star Brittney Griner against her nine-year prison sentence. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in Russian custody since she was arrested on 17 February at a Moscow airport. Russian authorities said they found vape cartridges in her possession that contained cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. She was sentenced on 4 August to nine years in a penal colony. Her family has decried her detention as politically motivated, with many of her supporters raising concerns for her safety, in regards to her race and sexuality. Griner is married to a woman. The US has characterised Griner’s arrest and subsequent sentencing as a “wrongful detention”. “President Biden has been clear that Brittney should be released immediately,” Jake Sullivan, national security advisor, said today. Sullivan called today’s rejected appeal “another sham judicial proceeding”. A broken window of a damaged residential building following a shelling in the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region. The president of Ukraine has said he is “ready to continue strengthening the strategic partnership” with the UK as Rishi Sunak said the “terrible war … must be seen successfully to its conclusion”. Speaking outside No 10 Downing Street, the new UK prime minister referenced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine twice, saying: “Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he hoped Sunak would “overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today”. In a tweet after Sunak’s first speech as prime minister, Zelenskiy said: Congratulations to Rishi Sunak on taking office as Prime Minister! I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I’m ready to continue strengthening the strategic partnership together! Russia’s defence ministry claims its forces have repelled Ukrainian attacks in the southern Kherson region and eastern Luhansk region of Ukraine. Russian-installed officials in Kherson are evacuating tens of thousands of civilians eastwards across the Dnipro river, facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has already seen Kyiv retake swathes of land seized by Russian forces in the first days of the war. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports. Alleged recordings of the head of a major Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer accused of aiding the Russian military – saying he “completely understands” why a Russian missile was fired at his factory – have been released by Kyiv’s security services after his arrest at the weekend. Vyacheslav Boguslaev, the president of Motor Sich, has been charged with treason after a raid at the weekend on his home in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The manufacturing heavyweight is suspected of selling engines – before and after the invasion – for Russian attack helicopters that have been used extensively against Ukrainian troops. The release of the alleged recordings have served as a reminder of the historic ties between veteran figures in the two countries’ arms industries and Ukraine’s internal battle to root out collaborators. Answering questions from journalists at a Kyiv courthouse about whether or not he had contracts with companies that work with the Russia military, Boguslaev said he was not “in the loop” and that Motor Sich produced some of the “best helicopters”. A lawyer for Boguslaev said his client had poor hearing and had not yet listened to the recordings released by Ukraine’s security services . The lawyer added that Boguslaev would explain his position during the trial. A judge ordered for Boguslaev to be held for two months without the possibility of bail. Firefighters work at the site of a car bomb explosion outside a building housing a local TV station in Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia oblast. The Donetsk oblast was hit hard in the past day, with at least 15 Russian strikes killing seven civilians and injuring three more. The Ukrainian national police said the strikes also destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. Further south, a car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTV in Russia-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people, including company employees, authorities said. While investigators are still looking into the blast, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. He wrote on Telegram that the power of the explosion was the equivalent of 2 kilograms of TNT. Amid air raid sirens, Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, arrived in Kyiv for his first trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded. His surprise visit comes six months after the Ukrainian government snubbed the Social Democrat’s offer of a visit over his past role in brokering closer economic ties between Germany and Russia. Meanwhile, in Berlin, European leaders convened for a conference on Ukraine’s reconstruction. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the conference in a video address that more than a third of the country’s energy sector has been destroyed by rockets and Iranian drones. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, spoke strongly about the need to aid Ukraine in its reconstruction, especially as it pertains to the country’s ascension into the European Union. Ukrainian authorities are now estimating that Russian forces have lost nearly 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. A look at the impact of the Russian invasion on food prices: Seven civilians were killed and three wounded amid 15 Russian strikes on eight settlements in the Donetsk oblast in the past day, authorities said. The Associated Press is reporting that the attacks came as Russian forces pressed their offensive on the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas. Ukrainian national police said the strikes destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. The surprise visit by the German president to Kyiv on Tuesday comes six months after the Ukrainian government snubbed the Social Democrat’s offer of a visit over his past role in brokering closer economic ties between Germany and Russia. Only last week, Steinmeier had aborted a trip to Kyiv due to security concerns, which led to the former foreign minister being criticised as cowardly by opposition parties in Germany. “I am looking forward to my meeting with [Ukrainian] President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv,” he said, according to a confirmation sent by his spokesperson. Before meeting Zelenskiy, Steinmeier will visit a town in the north of the country near the Belarusian border, which Ukraine says has been liberated from Russian troops but left with its infrastructure destroyed. Steinmeier will provide aid to the municipality for its energy infrastructure, he said. “My message to Ukrainians: you can count on Germany”, Steinmeier said. The German president has shown contrition since the start of the war in Ukraine. “My sticking to [the Baltic Sea pipeline project] Nord Stream 2, that was definitely a mistake,” he said in Berlin on 4 April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and of which our partners warned us.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, spoke strongly about the need to aid Ukraine in its reconstruction, especially as it pertains to the country’s ascension into the European Union. Meanwhile, while German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is in Ukraine for his first trip since the Russian invasion, European leaders are convening in Berlin for a conference on Ukraine’s reconstruction. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the conference in a video address that more than a third of the country’s energy sector has been destroyed by rockets and Iranian drones, Reuters is reporting. But despite Ukraine’s great need for funds to rebuild, Kyiv has not received a cent of the $17bn rapid recovery funds that the European Commission and World Bank determined that Ukraine would need for the first stage of recovery. Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is in Kyiv for his first trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded and Moscow has since escalated with unsubstantiated warnings of a “dirty bomb”. He touched down in Kyiv as air raid sirens began to sound around the capital. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. He wrote on Telegram that the power of the explosion was the equivalent of 2kg of TNT. A car explosion near the office of ZaTV in Russian-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people – including some company employees, officials said. ZaTv is a Russian propaganda channel that began broadcasting to the occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia oblast on 1 August. It’s unclear yet if the blast was an accident or deliberate, or if anyone is taking responsibility for the incident. No one told the 108 female Ukrainian prisoners of war, why, after five months in the most notorious jail in occupied Ukraine, their Russian captors were leading them to a bridge in the small south-west village of Kam’yans’ke. But when they saw their own soldiers, heard their own language being spoken, and realised that they were to be taking part in a prisoner exchange, they could not hold back their emotions, said 25-year-old Alina Panina, one of the Ukrainian soldiers. “They shouted glory to Ukraine. Some girls began to sing the national anthem of Ukraine,” Panina said. “Some girls could no longer hold back tears and cried. They fell to their knees on the ground.” Panina spoke exclusively to the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey. Read more of her extraordinary account here: As of today, Ukrainian authorities are estimating that Russian forces have lost approximately 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. If you’re just joining us, here is a quick recap of where things stand: Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. Russia’s grip on the city of Kherson appears increasingly fragile. Russian forces seemed to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself. All civilians were ordered to evacuate immediately over the weekend in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. All men remaining in Kherson have been invited to join a newly formed local militia. In a notice on Telegram, the occupation authorities said men had the “opportunity” to join territorial defence units if they chose to remain in Kherson of their own free will. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva conventions. Russia is bringing new military units into Kherson as it prepares to defend the city in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive, the head of Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate has said. Kyrylo Budanov also said Russia would slow Ukrainian troops’ advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhovka hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson. The UK Ministry of Defence reports that there have been at least 23 verified losses of Russia’s Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter in Ukraine since the invasion. This represents over 25% of the Russian air force’s in-service fleet of 90 Ka-52s, and nearly half of Russia’s total helicopter losses in Ukraine, according to British intelligence. The US is considering sending older Hawk air defence equipment from storage to Ukraine to help it defend against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, two US officials told Reuters. Ukraine and the US denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address. The White House national security council also rejected Shoigu’s claims. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” a statement said. The UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites after Kyiv requested an expert mission be sent to disprove Russian claims that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The US has had no indications that Russia has decided to use a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. The US believes Russia is “keeping lines of communication open” after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added. National leaders, development experts and CEOs will gather in Berlin today for a conference on what its hosts say must be a Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. The conference, hosted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission, will not involve concrete pledges of cash towards the estimated $750bn reconstruction cost. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in Ukraine for a surprise visit on Tuesday morning. Steinmeier will meet with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is his first trip to the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to German broadcaster NTV. The World Bank says it has disbursed an additional $500m to help Ukraine meet urgent spending needs created by the war. The financing by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank’s main lending arm, was supported by $500m in loan guarantees from Britain that were announced on 30 September, the bank said on Monday. There have been at least 23 verified losses of Russia’s Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter in Ukraine since the invasion, the UK Ministry of Defence reports. This represents over 25% of the Russian air force’s in-service fleet of 90 Ka-52s, and nearly half of Russia’s total helicopter losses in Ukraine, according to British intelligence. The ministry believes the Russian attack helicopters have probably suffered particular attrition from Ukrainian man-portable air defence systems (Manpads), while the helicopters frequently operate with less consistent top-cover from combat jets than they would expect under Russia military doctrine. “Russia is still failing to maintain adequate air superiority in order to reliably carry out effective fixed-wing close air support near the frontline, and its artillery ammunition is running low,” the latest intelligence report reads. Russian commanders are also likely increasingly resorting to conducting high-risk attack helicopter missions as one of the few options available to provide close support for troops in combat. The US is considering sending older Hawk air defence equipment from storage to Ukraine to help it defend against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, two US officials told Reuters. The Hawk interceptor missiles would be an upgrade to the Stinger missile systems – a smaller, shorter range air defence system – that the US has already sent to blunt Russia’s invasion. The Biden administration would use the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) to transfer the Hawk equipment, which is based on Vietnam-era technology but has been upgraded several times. The Hawk system is the predecessor to Patriot missile defence system made by Raytheon Technologies, which remains off the table for Ukraine, US officials told Reuters. The US would likely initially send interceptor missiles for the Hawk system to Ukraine because it was unclear if enough US launchers were in good repair, one US official told Reuters. The US systems have been in storage for decades. The World Bank says it has disbursed an additional $500m to help Ukraine meet urgent spending needs created by the war. The financing by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank’s main lending arm, was supported by $500m in loan guarantees from Britain that were announced on 30 September, the bank said on Monday. World Bank group president David Malpass said in a statement: The Russian invasion continues to cause massive destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure – including water, sanitation, and electricity networks - just as winter is approaching, further endangering Ukrainian people. The new portion of financing disbursed today will be used to maintain essential government services. We stand firmly to support the Ukrainian people as they face this unparalleled crisis.” The Kremlin alleges that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a dirty bomb in order to blame it on Russia and force an escalation to the war. Western countries have dismissed that claim as “transparently false”. So what is a dirty bomb? “Dirty bombs” have long been feared as a potential weapon of terrorists, because their main objective is to sow panic, confusion and anxiety by hurling radioactive dust and smoke into the atmosphere. Although no dirty bomb attack has ever been recorded, two failed attempts to detonate such a device were reported in the southern Russian province of Chechnya more than two decades ago. Technically known as radiological dispersion devices, dirty bombs are relatively primitive, imprecise weapons. They are much easier and cheaper to build than a nuclear device and also far less dangerous. Dirty bombs use conventional explosives, such as dynamite, placed alongside radioactive material, which is then flung outward by the force of the blast. The amount of radioactive material dispersed, while dangerous, is not necessarily lethal. Read the full explainer below: Russia has doubled down on its claim that Kyiv is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” in Ukraine, saying it would bring the issue to the UN security council on Tuesday. Moscow sent a letter on its claims about Kyiv to the United Nations late on Monday, and diplomats said it planned to raise the issue with the security council at a closed meeting the following day. “We will regard the use of the dirty bomb by the Kyiv regime as an act of nuclear terrorism,” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia wrote UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the security council in the letter, seen by Reuters. “We urge the western countries to exert their influence on the regime in Kiev to abandon its dangerous plans threatening international peace and security,” he wrote. “We call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to do everything in his power to prevent this heinous crime from happening.” The foreign ministers of France, Britain and the United States have rejected Moscow’s allegations as “transparently false” and reiterated their support for Ukraine. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” they said in a joint statement. The UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites at Kyiv’s request, in an apparent reaction to the Russian “dirty bomb” claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said both sites were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago. IAEA director general Rafael Grossi said in a statement on Monday: The IAEA inspected one of these locations one month ago and all our findings were consistent with Ukraine’s safeguards declarations. No undeclared nuclear activities or material were found there. The IAEA is preparing to visit the locations in the coming days. The purpose of the safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and material.” Russia’s state news agency RIA had earlier identified what it said were the two sites involved in the operation - the Eastern Mineral Enrichment Plant in central Dnipropetrovsk region and the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv. The IAEA statement did not name the facilities it would inspect. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier has reportedly arrived in Ukraine for a surprise visit today. It is his first trip to the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to German broadcaster NTV. Steinmeier arrived in the capital, Kyiv, by train in the morning and will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the course of the day, according to the broadcaster. Steinmeier’s spokesperson, Cerstin Gammelin, shared an image of the president arriving in Kyiv early this morning. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Russia plans to raise its accusation that Ukraine is planning a “dirty bomb” attack at the UN security council later today, diplomats have said. Britain, France and the US have all rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”. Meanwhile the UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites at Kyiv’s request, in order to discredit Russia’s unfounded claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said both sites were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago. Here are all the latest lines you may have missed: Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. Russia’s grip on the city of Kherson appears increasingly fragile.

The US believes Russia is “keeping lines of communication open” after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added. The United Nations has said urgent steps are needed to relieve a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea. Ukraine said Russian inspections that have been creating “significant” delays for the export of Ukrainian food products were “politically motivated” and a cause for concern. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Israel has condemned Russia’s invasion but has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well. Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic revolutionary guard corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. A pro-Kremlin television presenter has been accused of inciting genocide after calling for Ukrainian children to be “drowned” and “burned” alive during an interview on the state-funded RT channel. Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, was suspended from RT, and the head of Russia’s powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation. US basketball star Brittney Griner “does not expect miracles” at her appeal hearing on Tuesday, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling. Her lawyers said she would take part in Tuesday’s hearing by video link from the detention centre where she has been held, and that they expected a verdict the same day. National leaders, development experts and CEOs will gather in Berlin on Tuesday for a conference on what its hosts say must be a Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. The conference, hosted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission, will not involve concrete pledges of cash towards the estimated $750bn reconstruction cost.",

Australia was sidelined in the 1957 negotiations for the US-UK nuclear power sharing arrangement. Still, Australia explored the nuclear option for power generation with prime minister John Gorton actively involved in laying the foundations for a nuclear power station at the mouth of Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. The footings are now rusting and overgrown but point to the seriousness with which the Australian government treated the issue in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p> <p>Today Australia has one of the world’s largest repositories of uranium, but won’t use it or store it for others – despite happily exporting it to them and living on the most stable habitable continent with the most sparsely populated country on earth. The nuclear propulsion agreement portends a significant push to nuclear for power generation more broadly.</p> <p>Replacement submarines have featured in several recent defence white papers going back for more than a decade, notably the 2009 one which featured submarines on the cover. Back then, Kevin Rudd as ALP prime minister mandated Australia should increase its holdings from six to 12 submarines, but they would be conventionally, not nuclear, powered. Nuclear power was seen as something politically unpalatable for the ALP and difficult to sustain because of the limited nuclear skills set in Australia and the questionable willingness of the United States to support Australia to sustain such a capability. Indeed, US and UK ally, Canada, had considered acquiring nuclear propulsion submarines in the late cold war years but faced strong UK and US resistance to the idea. That seemed to be a pointer for Australia too.</p> <p>Australian strategic and defence policy has long struggled to reconcile the dialectic which has manifested as the contrasting fear of abandonment and fear of entrapment. Ever since 1942, when Australia last faced an existential crisis, Australian governments have looked to shore up ties with their “great and power friends”. For the last half century that has been principally with the US, but now the UK seems eager to return. How much the UK can commit in this space is still up for debate, mindful of its considerable challenges with an adventurist Russia under Putin and a squabbling Europe at their end of the Eurasian land mass.</p> <p>Conversely, pundits have long considered the risk of entrapment – of being drawn into a conflict in the Indo-Pacific not of our making. The government seems convinced that increased self-reliance comes through increased reliance – on US and UK nuclear propulsion technology, industrial bases and supply lines. Hopefully that’s the right call, but it comes with risks.</p> <p>This month we remember the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Anzus treaty – an alliance arrangement that avoided providing a direct security guarantee, promising instead “to consult” in the face of threats to the parties in the Pacific. This Aukus tripartite pact takes the Anzus security agreement to a new level. Being integrally connected with the US and UK through this new arrangement appears to be intended in part at least to bolster our confidence in not being abandoned. Conversely, as dark clouds build across the Indo-Pacific, the hope is that increased deterrence will bolster security, sending a message, particularly to Beijing, that force can and would be met. But the alternate view is that this bolstered investment in trilateral ties risks entrapment.</p> <p>US president Teddy Roosevelt once suggested it was best to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. In recent times, Australia has tended to speak loudly and carry a small stick. This move will certainly help to make the Australian stick a bit bigger. Hopefully, in doing so Australia will become more adept at speaking softly too.</p> <p>• John Blaxland is professor of international security and intelligence studies at the ANU’s strategic and defence studies centre</p>",

                    "bodyText": "A new trilateral security arrangement announced by US president Joe Biden will see Australia’s security ties with the United States and United Kingdom deepen, echoing the strong wartime bonds of the past, but with 21st century technology at its heart. In addition to covering shared technology, industrial bases and supply lines, core to this is the agreement for US and UK support to Australia through the supply of nuclear submarine propulsion technology – a move that effectively sidelines the delay-plagued submarine program centred on the French Naval group’s bespoke design. Ironically, some of the delays relate to France’s difficulty in converting a nuclear submarine design into a conventionally powered one. They would be unimpressed, I imagine. The choice reflects the heightened gravity of the great power contestational challenge which has put the security issues of the Indo-Pacific in stark relief. The US remains the world’s most powerful nation but China is fast catching up, with nuclear submarines being manufactured in southern China at an unprecedented rate. Post-Brexit Britain, eager to burnish its US security ties and bolster its “Global Britain” image, and looking for growing trade links in the region, is more enthused with Australia links than it has been for over half a century – when it walked away from the empire and joined the European Union’s precursor organisation in 1973. Australia and the UK had worked together in the 1950s on atomic weapons testing at Maralinga and Montebello Island, helping the UK step up to become a nuclear power. Australia was sidelined in the 1957 negotiations for the US-UK nuclear power sharing arrangement. Still, Australia explored the nuclear option for power generation with prime minister John Gorton actively involved in laying the foundations for a nuclear power station at the mouth of Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. The footings are now rusting and overgrown but point to the seriousness with which the Australian government treated the issue in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today Australia has one of the world’s largest repositories of uranium, but won’t use it or store it for others – despite happily exporting it to them and living on the most stable habitable continent with the most sparsely populated country on earth. The nuclear propulsion agreement portends a significant push to nuclear for power generation more broadly. Replacement submarines have featured in several recent defence white papers going back for more than a decade, notably the 2009 one which featured submarines on the cover. Back then, Kevin Rudd as ALP prime minister mandated Australia should increase its holdings from six to 12 submarines, but they would be conventionally, not nuclear, powered. Nuclear power was seen as something politically unpalatable for the ALP and difficult to sustain because of the limited nuclear skills set in Australia and the questionable willingness of the United States to support Australia to sustain such a capability. Indeed, US and UK ally, Canada, had considered acquiring nuclear propulsion submarines in the late cold war years but faced strong UK and US resistance to the idea. That seemed to be a pointer for Australia too. Australian strategic and defence policy has long struggled to reconcile the dialectic which has manifested as the contrasting fear of abandonment and fear of entrapment. Ever since 1942, when Australia last faced an existential crisis, Australian governments have looked to shore up ties with their “great and power friends”. For the last half century that has been principally with the US, but now the UK seems eager to return. How much the UK can commit in this space is still up for debate, mindful of its considerable challenges with an adventurist Russia under Putin and a squabbling Europe at their end of the Eurasian land mass. Conversely, pundits have long considered the risk of entrapment – of being drawn into a conflict in the Indo-Pacific not of our making. The government seems convinced that increased self-reliance comes through increased reliance – on US and UK nuclear propulsion technology, industrial bases and supply lines. Hopefully that’s the right call, but it comes with risks. This month we remember the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Anzus treaty – an alliance arrangement that avoided providing a direct security guarantee, promising instead “to consult” in the face of threats to the parties in the Pacific. This Aukus tripartite pact takes the Anzus security agreement to a new level. Being integrally connected with the US and UK through this new arrangement appears to be intended in part at least to bolster our confidence in not being abandoned. Conversely, as dark clouds build across the Indo-Pacific, the hope is that increased deterrence will bolster security, sending a message, particularly to Beijing, that force can and would be met. But the alternate view is that this bolstered investment in trilateral ties risks entrapment. US president Teddy Roosevelt once suggested it was best to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. In recent times, Australia has tended to speak loudly and carry a small stick. This move will certainly help to make the Australian stick a bit bigger. Hopefully, in doing so Australia will become more adept at speaking softly too. • John Blaxland is professor of international security and intelligence studies at the ANU’s strategic and defence studies centre",
