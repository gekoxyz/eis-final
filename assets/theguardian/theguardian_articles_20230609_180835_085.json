In this immense, immersive company’s hands, a crowd is entirely malleable. With the audience anonymised by masks, we can be anything they want us to be. Its current production, The Burnt City, allows us to wander around the fall of Troy, bustled together and split apart as the evening goes on. The event is less about the story and more about the scenery and our exhilarating freedom to roam within it, being at once invisible and a central part of the performance. Inviting endless curiosity in its open-world settings, Punchdrunk has set the standard for how to manage a crowd. Kate Wyver * * * Film The cinema was born out of the crowd: masses of people seeing a specific drama on a scale not imagined before. Charlie Chaplin was himself a beneficiary of the mass production of celebrity. In Modern Times, he is walking on the streets and notices a truck with a flag stuck to the planks of timber poking out of its back (a safety precaution to prevent collision). The flag falls off. Charlie picks it up and runs along behind, waving it, trying to attract the driver’s attention. Then a crowd of communist demonstrators turn the corner and happen to march up behind him, and to the cops it looks as if Charlie is the flag-waving rabble-rousing leader. He is arrested: his personal intentions were irrelevant in the wider stream of history. Charlie thought he was acting as an individual and got caught up in the crowd. Peter Bradshaw * * * Book There are plenty of wonderful crowd scenes in the novels of Charles Dickens, but in Barnaby Rudge he really lets loose, spending page after raging-and-roaring page describing the chaos of the anti-papist Gordon riots. Coincidentally, this novel was published in the same year (1841) as Charles Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds and it also helped set the tone for future thinking about seething masses of humanity. The “outrages of the mob”, he writes, are like those of a “mad monster”, “more terrible when roused” than the ocean, “more unreasonable … more cruel”. It is all frighteningly familiar, especially when Dickens shows us the demagogues and manipulators whose false accusations drive the crowds to a frenzied attack on pthe Houses of Parliament. It can feel as if he’s describing the era of Brexit and Trump as much as the events of 1780. Sam Jordison Art Three’s a crowd, they say. In Christ Mocked by Hieronymus Bosch, four bullying tormentors crowd a passive, helpless innocent. They swarm him as he ignores their japes and cruelties, get in his face, enclose him, in a claustrophobic image of other people as a mob of heartless monsters. You get the feeling this is how Bosch, consumed by visions of hell and fantasies of paradise, saw the neighbours who surrounded him in the Dutch town where he lived. To his vulnerable and isolated imagination, others look like an inhuman crowd. He anticipates the nightmare crowds of Munch and Poe in this medieval and yet uneasily modern painting. Jonathan Jones * * * Music If HBO’s Euphoria has you believing that all Gen Z-ers love to party, Alessia Cara’s 2015 hit Here still stands up as an anthem for the antisocial. Under a slinky sample of Isaac Hayes’s Ike’s Rap II (also well known via Portishead’s Glory Box and Tricky’s Hell Is Round the Corner), it perfectly captures the feeling of drifting from room to room at an overcrowded house party, swerving drinks and inane conversation. “Some girl’s talking ’bout her haters / She ain’t got none.” Cara may not be impressed by what she sees, but there is a subtle fondness in how specifically she captures the rituals of teendom, letting the chaos wash over her as a rite of social passage.

The system, in other words, would need to be able to be made bigger, to be quickly put into action and to be repaired in case of attack or accident. The military network could include the ability to track high-velocity projectiles and the use of infrared, would need to be “resilient to cyber and electronic warfare attacks”, and would need to transmit and receive data from assets “at any global position”. The defence department has issued a request for information, saying it is looking for “progressive and innovative ideas” for a space-based data transport and relay network (DTRN). “The DTRN is envisioned to be a flexible and configurable global converged network in space, drawing on multiple security domains to disseminate defence data,” the request said. “It should be resilient, enabling secure and rapid transmission and reception of multiple digital data types through an open systems architecture of satellite and ground assets using commercial military frequencies. “The DTRN would be operated for military purpose and should be scalable, rapidly deployable and reconstitutable.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Aukus submarines have been dominating defence-related conversations recently, because of the enormous $368bn price tag and concerns that the first Australia-made nuclear submarine will not be ready until the 2040s. Meanwhile, Guardian Australia has spoken to people in the space industry who feel the other parts of Aukus – the so-called “pillar two” – are being overlooked. Pillar two includes artificial intelligence, drones, cyber capabilities and other technologies, all of which use space-based assets and many of which are likely to be realities years before the submarines. Satellites, and therefore space, are critical for surveillance, navigation, weapons guidance and communication already, and will become more so in the future. Defence projects already under way include Def799 for space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and JP9102 for satellite communications systems. A senior defence strategy and capability analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Malcolm Davis, said while space was critical for Aukus’s pillar two, it would also be crucial for pillar one, in terms of communicating with submarines. “If you go down the laser optical route [instead of low frequency radio] you get voice, internet, the works. Satellites and space are going to be important for comms,” he said. “They also open up avenues for anti-submarine warfare, using light detecting and ranging (Lidar). “In pillar two, in terms of countering hypersonic threats, in terms of autonomous systems, space is crucial to all of that.” The Space Industry Association of Australia has argued that Aukus should be used to bolster space capabilities through technology and infrastructure sharing. The partners should build new constellations of satellites to reduce their dependency on existing technology, thereby minimising the impact of military attacks on satellites, the association’s then director of operations, Philip Citowicki, wrote in a 2022 piece for the Australian National University’s National Security College. He argued that a loss of access to space, or the destruction of space-based assets, would have “catastrophic effects”, but the Aukus partners could work together to reduce the risks. Guardian Australia has asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, if Australia needs to do more on space defence. Davis warned that China, particularly, has offensive space capabilities. He paraphrased a quote from British army commander Bernard Montgomery, who said “if we lose the war in the air, we lose the war and we lose it quickly”. “The same might be said of space, we lose the war and we lose it quickly,” Davis said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/13/teletubbies-fashion-christian-cowan-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-13T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"They had us at eh oh: the surprise staying power of Teletubbies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/13/teletubbies-fashion-christian-cowan-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/13/teletubbies-fashion-christian-cowan-netflix","fields":{"bodyText":"“It was a no-brainer for me. These icons needed their fashion moment,” says British fashion designer Christian Cowan. The icons in question? They’re up to 10ft tall, frolic on a bucolic planet, hang out with a vacuum cleaner and worship a neonate deity known as the Sun Baby. Cowan is used to dressing the likes of Cardi B, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Lizzo rather than Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. The London College of Fashion graduate set up his eponymous label in 2016 and has built a cult following thanks to party girl looks and outrageous collaborations, including collections with Powerpuff Girls, Doritos and TV sitcom American Dad. It is fitting, then, that he was the brains behind March’s most charming fashion collaboration: a new Teletubbies capsule collection. A photoshoot was set up to promote Cowan’s new line: in it, the Tubbies pose in their original suits alongside human models in bright-coloured clothing. These photos have been printed on the shirts, hoodies and jeans available to buy – autographs of the four stars are splashed across the prints. The standout piece, though, is the Teletubbies Boot, a green high heel number zipping up to a bust of Dipsy and priced at £2,041. While Cowan’s Instagram post playfully reads “no caption necessary”, commenters – including Marc Jacobs, Paris Hilton and Michelle Visage – were more outspoken. “Need!” exclaimed Hilton. Time will tell whether they sell or remain as a social media memory; at the time of writing, the tees and jeans have sold out but there are still boots available. While Cowan’s capsule may seem offbeat, he is not the first to be inspired by the aerial-headed quartet. The boots follow in the footsteps of a collaboration with Koi footwear last December, featuring five vegan, gender-neutral shoes with colour schemes to match all four characters, plus faithful vacuum cleaner Noo-Noo. Dipsy, too, has walked the runway for London designer Bobby Abley as part of his Tubbies-inspired collection in 2017. Teletubbies has always been in fashion. Created by former teacher and children’s television show producer Anne Wood and writer Andrew Davenport, the show premiered on BBC Two in March 1997 and quickly became a kids’ classic, reaching 2 million viewers an episode in just five months. Teletubbies Say Eh-oh, the show’s theme tune, was a UK No 1 single for two weeks later that year. The show would go on to be exported to pretty much every country under the infant sun, becoming one of the BBC’s most lucrative programmes ever and spawning a dizzying array of toys and spin-offs. The tabloid interest was so fervent that visitors were blindfolded to keep the show’s filming location secret. Later, after it was discovered to be filmed in a field in Wimpstone, Warwickshire, the owner filled the site with water to stop a constant stream of fans from trespassing. Like the best kids’ shows, Teletubbies made absolutely no sense. So much so that it led to outrage from parents, aghast at its lack of comprehensible speech or educational value. Harvard psychologist Susan Linn saw it as another sign of the increasing commericalisation of children’s television, while the Daily Mirror said “the show was a bad influence on children”. In the end, though, the alien babies won, playing their part in 485 episodes on-and-off until 2018. Now, Tubbymania is back. In November last year, Netflix relaunched the show. That followed on from the animated series Teletubbies, Let’s Go! just two months prior, and a 3D version looking at baby Tubbies, Tiddlytubbies. Last year, the official quartet even auditioned on Britain’s Got Talent to celebrate 25 years in the biz. Dancing to Beyoncé and One Direction, they handed out antennae headbands while confetti blasted in the background. The audience went bananas, and two minutes were frittered away in the best way possible. The comeback is thanks to the creative minds at WildBrain, an animation studio and digital media company that also owns the licences to Inspector Gadget and In the Night Garden. It is set on pushing the Tubbies back to the front and centre of pop culture. “They’ve never really gone away,” says Melissa Goodrich, who oversees franchises at the company. Noting that the “original fans are now adults”, Goodrich believes that the foursome are ready to re-enter the zeitgeist through “over-the-top fun moments in pop culture, fashion and important causes”. One of those causes has been supporting gay pride, with the Tubbies teaming up with the labels Ellesse and GoGuy for a Pride collection. Back in 1999, commentators such as the firebrand US baptist pastor Jerry Falwell were outraged about Tinky Winky’s red handbag, arguing that it suggested that he was gay and a danger to children. Tinky Winky has since been celebrated as a gay icon. “I remember the outrage about Tinky Winky’s handbag as a child and the hysteria over a purple alien wearing a skirt,” says the Brighton-based drag artist Alfie Ordinary, who performs a routine inspired by the purple Tubbie. “I wanted to take this homophobic outrage and make Tinky Winky truly outrageous,” he says. WildBrain is actively encouraging collaborations, licensing out the likeness to designers, artists and performers to get more Tubbies on the telly. It’s no wonder that so many are clamouring to do so: the visuals, for aesthetes into kitsch, are the best thing since sliced tubby toast. If you think the Tubbies look out-of-this-world, you’re right: they’re based on astronauts. “I was fascinated by the moon landings,” Davenport told the Guardian in 2012. “It struck me as funny that, at this pinnacle of human achievement, the figures that emerged in bulky spacesuits from landing capsules are like toddlers, with oversized heads and foreshortened legs – and they respond to the excitement of their new world by bouncing about.” It was an inspired decision: with their pipe-cleaner antennae, gormlessly cheery faces and tummy-mounted TVs, the show’s alien babies are instantly recognisable. You know you’ve got a hit on your hands when your characters already look like toys; sales of merchandise in the show’s first decade are estimated to have exceeded $1bn. Of course, as with any kids’ TV show, the visuals aren’t all sunshine and rainbows. As anyone brave enough to rewatch a beloved childhood programme will know, there can be a creepy, uncanny side to the shows of our youth, and even the biggest Teletubbies fans will admit this exists in Tubbyland, too. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey director Rhys Frake-Waterfield, who’s currently making a name for himself by giving horrific, adult twists to childhood icons (Bambi is next) wishes he could do the same with the Tubbies. “I have always thought the Teletubbies were incredibly strange. They are like half-naked aliens who hang around with children,” he says. “There is something very evil going on, which I’d love to explore.” There’s no risk of a Teletubbies slasher crossing into the mainstream – unlike Winnie the Pooh, the show’s copyright will last into the next century. Its co-creator Wood, though, who is still producing new shows, has expressed concern about how reboots can stunt original creativity. “There are other people out there making good work, or at least they could, were they given the opportunity,” she said recently. While Wood’s concern is understandable, the comfort-blanket quality of shows such as Teletubbies continues to appeal. “Millions of my generation grew up with them daily as we ate our sliced apple,” Cowan says. “My sister and I would pile on to the sofa to tune in to our vivid friends. We always have a soft spot for our childhood idols.” With many more collaborations in the future ready to enchant children and adults alike, we won’t be saying tubby bye-bye any time soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T22:20:50Z","webTitle":"Five Great Reads: apathy fit for a king, Oliver Stone goes nuclear, and how we exposed robodebt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","fields":{"bodyText":"Top of the weekend to you all. One of Australia’s most significant events of 2023 has finally arrived, and to everyone in Brisbane for the NRL’s Magic Round – play hard but fair. There’s also the not insignificant matter of us officially gaining a new head of state. I know, I know – these things creep up on you when your day-to-day is completely unaffected by it. For the royal watchers among you, the Guardian has the event (and its fallout) covered. If you’re a bit “meh” about it all, read on – you’re not alone. 1. God save us all Take it away, Stephen Marche – Canadian author and cultural commentator: *** “You might think you live in a time of truth and reconciliation, or perhaps even, if you’re feeling optimistic, progress. But this week if you’re British or a member of the 56 sovereign states that still, somehow, find themselves in the Commonwealth, you’re waking up in a country where a priest is going to smear oil – vegan oil from Jerusalem – on a rather pinkish, rather broad forehead to signify one man’s status as the Lord’s anointed.” Marche journeyed from Toronto to London to try to make sense of the crowning of King Charles. “The man represents us,” he writes, “but it’s hard to think of anyone less representative.” How long will it take to read: 10 minutes. Further reading: Guardian Australia encounters a mix of apathy, indignation and enthusiasm on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney. And in England, Gaby Hinsliff was contentedly indifferent until the call to swear an oath of allegiance went out. 2. Oliver Stone on Putin, US politics and nuclear power Oliver Stone’s filmography is all about going big: the Vietnam war, media-fuelled mass murderers, any number of US presidents (and who really killed them). Now the legendary firebrand is not only tackling the vexed issue of nuclear power but making a strong case for it in his new documentary, Nuclear Now. Lauren Mechling caught up with Stone (and his real-time factchecker, and his “twinkly-eyed” therapist) in New York and emerged relatively unscathed. What does he think of the Russian president? “A great leader for his country and the people love him.” And Joe Biden? “A cold warrior in the worst sense of the word.” How long will it take to read: Four minutes. 3. Was Michael Jordan’s career a failure? That was the question posed by Giannis Antetokounmpo when a reporter prodded him about the early exit of his Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. After all, Jordan won only six titles in 15 seasons – a 40% success rate. Below average, if you look just at the numbers. Barry Glendenning writes that the NBA great in waiting’s “unique, bold take” was a breath of fresh profundity among the usual post-match platitudes. *** “Some days it is your turn, some days it’s not. That’s what sports is about. You don’t always win.” – The world according to Giannis How long will it take to read: Three minutes.

The dreary, seductive allure of ‘stealth wealth’ “Stealth wealth” is the name given to the clothes worn by the super-rich, writes Eva Wiseman. Defining characteristics? “Bloodless, grandly bland, dreary.” So why do so many of we mere mortals get sucked into trying to dress like the 1%? Notable quote: “Buying into ‘stealth wealth’ feels like buying a band T-shirt, except the band are the worst people in the world, and the T-shirt costs the same as a month’s rent, and the music is them laughing as they shout ‘Eat shit’ from a car.” How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. How two reporters gave voice to the victimised Christopher Knaus reported the first clear evidence of how income averaging was being used by Centrelink to raise millions in inaccurate debts. That was early 2017, when he says covering the scheme later known as robodebt was like “bashing your head against a wall”. Until Luke Henriques-Gomes arrived at Guardian Australia the following year. His reporting, which foregrounded the voices of welfare recipients, and Knaus’s was singled out during the royal commission at which Scott Morrison took the stand. Caitlin Cassidy interviewed Knaus and Henriques-Gomes for the first in a series marking the 10th anniversary of Guardian Australia. How long will it take to read: Three minutes. Further reading: Marina Hyde sounds off on a UK scandal with uncanny similarities to robodebt – and how as the chatterati get consumed by the daily outrage cycle, “iniquitous and dysfunctional systems [are] free to sail on regardless”.

Speaking at the first hearing of the joint select committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice referendum, a string of legal experts said the voice would be legislated to provide representations on relevant matters, akin to advice. The former chief justice of Australia Robert French had four words of reply to the hand-wringing among conservative circles, including the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, that the voice could hold a de facto veto over public holidays. “No substance in it,” he said. “I’ll be polite about it. “That would be no more than advice and it certainly wouldn’t bind anybody and it wouldn’t be a veto. What is a de facto veto? … I’m still at a bit of a loss. “If I were confronted with this provision as a judge … it’s a big thing, to draw a constitutional implication and the implications which have been suggested are not supported by the text and will be inconsistent with it.” The former high court justice Kenneth Hayne told the inquiry that he couldn’t see “anything in those drafts that comes anywhere near providing anything like a veto”. “The voice will not waste its social or political capital by exploring the outer range of its scope of representation,” he said. “[That is] an unreal case or distorting possibility or extreme example.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey agreed. She said she was confident the voice would stay focused on core issues affecting First Nations people and to do otherwise would squander its resources and influence. “If the voice goes out and tries to make representations about what submarines Australia should buy or whatever, well … people will think it’s crazy,” she said. “But more to the point its constituency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be awfully furious that it is not focusing on the things that are relevant and important to them.” Experts were split, however, on whether the wording of the constitutional amendment should be altered to remove the reference to the voice as being able to make representations to the executive government. Louise Clegg, a barrister from PG Hely Chambers, was in favour. She said there was “no prescription” in the Uluru statement about what should be in the wording and to exclude it would still satisfy the statement, while clarifying she wasn’t an Indigenous person. The constitutional lawyer Prof Greg Craven said there had been “mission creep” by the working group in drafting the wording and it was “very surprisingly different” to what he thought when it came back out. But the constitutional barrister Bret Walker said it was “bizarre” to suggest the inclusion of a reference to “executive government” would bring in court cases. He said the proposed wording “vaults over race” to recognise people were “supplanted against their will” and who “have not been dealt with very generously ever since”. “It’s the combination of recognition and a kind of reparation, which in my opinion cannot possibly, seriously or charitably be seen as an exercise of inequality,” he said. Twomey told the inquiry the high court was “not in the business of trying to destroy government” and reiterated executive government means minister and government departments but does not include all statutory bodies. George Williams, a constitutional lawyer, said the voice would go some way towards finishing the “unfinished business” of the 1967 referendum that recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. He said the constitution is a document that does not reflect the people “who have been the custodians of these lands and waters” for tens of thousands of years. Inquiry hearings will be held in Orange, Cairns and Perth to gather views from Indigenous communities and those involved in the processes that led to the voice proposal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T12:27:27Z","webTitle":"Farm Hall review – riveting wartime thriller shows secret mission to bug German nuclear scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","fields":{"bodyText":"In the summer of 1945, after Adolf Hitler was defeated and the allies had almost secured victory in the second world war, six German scientists were taken and held at a stately home in Cambridgeshire. The group, known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club) were leading lights in Germany’s nuclear weapons programme and part of the race to produce the world’s first atomic bomb. They were detained at Farm Hall for seven months, all their conversations covertly recorded. We see those men in Katherine Moar’s riveting drama with nothing to do but play chess, bicker and pick over their part in Hitler’s war. It unravels like an intelligent thriller whose ending we know but is nail-biting nonetheless – all the more an achievement given this is Moar’s debut. A drama inspired by the original recorded conversations and directed by Stephen Unwin with elegant economy, it is packed with learning but never shows off, providing just enough knowledge for a scene to carry its full meaning. Heisenberg (Alan Cox) is Uranium Club head and group leader here; his friend, Weizsäker (Daniel Boyd), has family links to the Third Reich, Bagge (Archie Backhouse) is an apologetic Nazi party member while Von Laue (David Yelland) was a vocal objector to the regime and Hahn (Forbes Masson) grapples with guilt for discovering nuclear fission (a key factor in the creation of the atomic bomb). Last, there is group pariah, Diebner (Julius D’Silva), who guiltlessly admits to supporting the Nazis. Every actor brings their character’s moral position alive and gives quietly searing performances. These positions are artfully played out in dialogue: some refuse to acknowledge responsibility, others boast of open resistance to Hitler but everyone is implicated in some way. “I needed the work,” says one man, about his collaboration. “The world is ugly, the work is beautiful,” says another, and there are echoes of CP Taylor’s Good in the ways they absolve themselves from blame. We only ever see them in a drawing room whose fireplace and peeling wallpaper carries a battered country-house grandeur (design by Ceci Calf). There is awkward comedy at the start, and in their boredom they resemble Beckett’s men; their keeper, referred to repeatedly but remaining off stage, a Godot-like figure who never emerges. That tone shifts in intensity when they hear of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings which bring – shockingly – intellectual admiration and jealousy, along with guilt for some. Hahn’s sense of culpability over the scientific discovery that led to the bombing is excellently dramatised. Heisenberg’s ambivalence is explored too – did he sabotage his own scientific breakthrough as a way to resist Hitler’s regime? The question lingers at the end of this punchy, accomplished play.

Putin announced his intention to halt participation in the agreement towards the end of a belligerent 100-minute speech in which he charged the US and western powers with trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Russia. His fiery rhetoric prompted instant reaction across the political spectrum in Washington. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who was a Russian specialist at the White House National Security Council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”. The strategy was to increase political discord in an attempt to embolden calls for an end to US support for Ukraine. “It’s playing to all those people who want Ukraine to surrender and capitulate to avoid a massive nuclear exchange and world war three, a kind of nuclear armageddon,” she said. Thomas Graham, Russia director within George W Bush’s National Security Council, agreed that part of Putin’s calculation was to provoke “certain circles in the US to wonder whether the risks of supporting Ukraine are worth it”. Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that given how politicized Washington has become, “there will be elements in the Republican party who will play this up as a way of casting aspersions on Biden’s foreign policy”. Graham’s prediction appeared to have been fulfilled hours after Putin made his threat. Prominent rightwing Republicans heavily criticized Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv, accusing him of devoting more care to Ukraine than to his own people. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who is eyeing a 2024 presidential run, told Fox News that “an open-ended blank cheque [for Ukraine] is unacceptable”. He compared Biden’s staunch support for Ukraine unfavorably with his approach to immigration at the Mexican border. “I and many Americans are thinking to ourselves, OK, he’s very concerned about those borders halfway around the world, [but] he’s not done anything to secure our own border here at home.” New Start was negotiated under the Obama presidency in 2010 and renewed for five years in February 2021. It was designed to ensure strategic stability between the US and Russia, which hold 90% of the world’s total number of nuclear warheads. The practical implications of Putin’s threatened suspension are likely to be debated in Washington over the coming weeks. It is unlikely in the short term to change much on the ground, Graham pointed out, given that the treaty had already begun to unravel before the Russian president’s speech. Last month the state department accused Russia of breaking its monitoring obligations by refusing to allow US inspectors into its nuclear weapons facilities. Graham warned though that it will now be all but impossible to replace New Start once the treaty expires in February 2026. “We are looking at the final demise of the arms control architecture that was built up starting in the 1960s based largely on bilateral relations between the US and the Soviet Union and then Russia. We will have a much more difficult and complex environment to deal with.” Russia experts expressed relief that the Kremlin had stopped short of withdrawing from the treaty altogether. “This does not signify that Putin is planning to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine anytime soon,” said Suzanne Loftus, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. But Loftus added that the longer-term prospects of nuclear stability were “ominous”. She said: “We’re losing the progress we’ve made on non-proliferation, even during the cold war.” Putin’s audacious move puts the ball back in Washington’s court. Advocacy groups pressing for nuclear threat reduction urged the Biden administration to show restraint even in the face of the latest provocation. “The goal here, as we see it, is to get Russia back into New Start, because the treaty serves the national interests of both countries,” said Emma Belcher, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington and San Francisco-based funding organization devoted to reducing nuclear risk. Belcher praised the way that Biden had so far refused to rise to Putin’s bait. In his speech to mark the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine in Warsaw on Tuesday, the US president pointedly declined to refer to his Russian counterpart’s threat to suspend participation. Such restraint should continue to be the Biden administration’s response, Belcher said. “What the US should avoid is to use Putin’s statement to justify increasing its own nuclear arsenal – that would merely move the clock back.” Christopher Chivvis, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, gave a more sombre assessment of the impact on US policy. Putin’s move would make it more difficult for the US to monitor Russia’s nuclear forces and how they were deployed, he said, and a growing lack of clarity about Russia’s nuclear actions would in turn darken the mood in Washington. Chivvis said: “It will very likely drive Washington toward a more conservative, more hawkish, approach to the US’s own nuclear arsenal – just to err on the safe side.” The result, Chivvis suggested, could be exactly the arms-race dynamics the New Start treaty was intended to prevent. The US and Russia would, he said, likely now increase spending on their nuclear arms, which is not what anyone – Russia included – would logically want. Such a gloomy prognosis makes Hill’s warning that Putin was attempting to provoke rifts within American opinion all the more disconcerting. “Unity is extraordinarily important at this moment on the domestic front, because it determines our own ability to respond,” Hill said. “Putin is looking for any cracks. We need to be united as Americans, and resist the temptation to play silly politics over this.” • The headline of this article was amended on 14 March 2023.An earlier version referred to “nuclear treaty pullout”.

During the second world war, then Australian prime minister John Curtin found himself in direct conflict with the British government when Winston Churchill demanded Australian troops be deployed to Burma. But Curtin insisted troops return to defend Australia after the fall of Singapore in 1942. Asked on Wednesday what would happen in a situation like the one Curtin faced with Churchill, whether Australia would be in full control of the submarines or whether our independence could be muddied by operational oversight by the US or UK, the prime minister said: “Australia will maintain our sovereignty.” Albanese said the deployment of military assets in the event of any conflict was “a decision for Australia as a sovereign nation, just as the United States will maintain its sovereignty and the United Kingdom will maintain its”. The prime minister used a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to foreshadow increased defence spending as a consequence of the looming government response to the Defence Strategic Review, while characterising the Aukus security arrangement between Australia, the US and the UK as “the future”. There is persistent speculation the next steps in the Aukus pact will be outlined by the three alliance partners in the US in March. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Paul Keating has previously raised concerns about the potential for Aukus to erode Australian sovereignty. Keating has contended Aukus will see Australia’s strategic sovereignty “outsourced to another state, a North Atlantic state, the United States” which is dangerous, given the US had “no idea what to do with itself in Asia”. Keating’s concerns about sovereignty are shared by another former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether nuclear submarines could be “operated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navy”, and whether that effectively meant “sovereignty would be shared with the US”. Concerns about a diminution of Australian sovereignty were heightened back in 2021 when Biden’s top Indo-Pacific adviser, Kurt Campbell, observed that Aukus would lead to “a deeper interconnection and almost a melding in many respects of our services and working together on common purpose that we couldn’t have dreamed about five or 10 years ago”. Campbell later clarified his remarks. “I fully understand how important sovereignty and independence is for Australia. So I don’t want to leave any sense that somehow that would be lost,” he said during an Australian webinar ahead of the 2022 election. The sustained controversy has prompted the defence minister, Richard Marles, to declare in a speech to parliament that acquiring nuclear-powered submarines would “dramatically enhance” Australia’s sovereignty, rather than undermine it. The head of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce says Australia will retain full operational control over the submarines, while potentially having US or British engineers on board to provide technical advice. During Wednesday’s speech at the National Press Club, Albanese hinted that Australia needed to expand its nuclear research as part of Aukus, saying the arrangement would lead to “greater exchanges as well and greater knowledge buildup”. Albanese said that in order to “back up the assurance of sovereignty” Australia needed to build up its “human capability” – not just “capability in terms of things that are metal and shiny”. “That’s very much a part of our focus and our thinking,” he added. The prime minister also strongly backed the Asio chief, Mike Burgess, who has stepped up his warnings about espionage and foreign interference. Burgess used his annual threat assessment speech the previous night to say he was “concerned that there are senior people in this country who appear to believe that espionage and foreign interference is no big deal”. Burgess said some unnamed “individuals in business, academia and the bureaucracy have told me Asio should ease up its operational responses to avoid upsetting foreign regimes”. At no stage did Burgess suggest ministers were among those urging Asio to rein in its work. But Albanese said on Wednesday he wanted to make clear “that Asio is doing the right thing and that they have the support of my government in all of their actions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ale Hop & Laura Robles: Agua Dulce review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The cajón contains a radical history. The box-shaped percussion instrument is now commonly used in acoustic setups but it originated in 19th-century Peru as a makeshift means of enslaved people defying Spanish colonial restrictions on music. Workers would put down their wooden crates and begin using them as drums, beating out rhythms and producing dances that have since become part of folk tradition. For Peruvian artist Ale Hop and percussionist Laura Robles, the cajón’s subversive past has been obscured by its contemporary ubiquity. On their debut album, Agua Dulce, they present nine tracks of electronically processed and deconstructed cajón rhythms, aiming to reconnect a percussive sound with its rebellious roots. Opener Son de los Diablos sets the tone. Taking its name from a traditional Afro-Peruvian dance, Robles’s electric cajón thunders through fuzzing reverb and gives the original’s skittering rhythm a menacing, industrial charge, supplemented by Hop’s synth bass. The dark atmosphere continues on the slow crawl of another folk dance, Lamento, while the galloping pace of Fuga en Alcatraz pits Robles’s dextrous cajón-playing against an eerie synth tone that rings out for the entirety of the track’s seven minutes. Each composition treads the line between establishing a stable, danceable groove and its collapse – making for an often unnerving listening experience. The title track fades the cajón rhythm in and out over squeaking electronics like an undulating wave, while Defensoras del Morro builds faster from techno to breakbeat before abruptly ending. These unpredictable contexts and electrified elements push the cajón into exciting new territory – far from the acoustic folk jam settings it is often found in today. In making its bass tone boom and allowing its higher registers to hiss with reverb, the duo create a modern reimagining of the instrument’s raw power, its heart-thumping tension and physical sense of catharsis. Also out this month Danny Mekonnen, saxophonist and ex-member of Ethiopian music group Debo Band, releases his first solo album as Dragonchild (FPE Records). On his beguiling self-titled record, Mekonnen traverses everything from Ethio-jazz to groove-laden funk and Afrobeats, all unified by the clarion call of his horn. MC Yallah returns with her fantastic second album, Yallah Beibe (Hakuna Kulala), pairing machine gun flows with bass-forward, deconstructed club edits. She plays fast and loose with genre, with highlights the screamo-influenced No One Seems to Bother and the dancehall euphoria of Big Bung. Producer Alex Figueira’s debut album Mentallogenic (Music With Soul) might prove to be a crate digger’s delight, trading heavily on dancefloor cumbia rhythms but with a raw, lo-fi recorded feel perfect for sound system atmospherics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T18:36:50Z","webTitle":"UK sets new record for wind power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain has set a new record for wind generation as power from onshore and offshore turbines helped boost clean energy supplies late last year. National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO), which handles Great Britain’s grid, said that a new record for wind generation was set on 30 December, when 20.91 gigawatts (GW) were produced by turbines. This represented the third time Britain’s fleet of wind turbines set new generation records in 2022. In May, National Grid had to ask some turbines in the west of Scotland to shut down, as the network was unable to store such a large amount of electricity when a then record 19.9GW of power was produced – enough to boil 3.5m kettles. The ESO said a new record was also set for the share of electricity on the grid coming from zero-carbon sources – renewables and nuclear – which supplied 87.2% of total power. These sources have accounted for about 55% to 59% of power over the past couple of years. The surge in wind generation represents a remarkable reversal in fortunes as a cold snap that enveloped Britain and Europe quickly turned to milder weather. Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills. The cold weather came with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero. Emergency coal-fired power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby but ultimately not used, while gas-fired generation accounted for nearly 60% of the UK’s power output at times. However, milder weather in the UK and Europe in recent days has led to a reduction in demand from consumers and a fall in wholesale gas prices. It has also reduced the risk of power cuts this winter, which National Grid had warned could be a possibility. Wind generation is seen as a crucial part of Britain’s move towards net zero. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is expected to overturn a moratorium on new onshore wind projects with a consultation on the matter due to run until March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T02:42:48Z","webTitle":"US nuclear-armed submarines to resume visits to South Korea for first time in 30 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"The US and South Korea have reaffirmed their alliance, agreeing that nuclear-armed submarines would resume port visits and threatening a “swift, overwhelming and decisive response” to any North Korean nuclear attack, including retaliation in kind by the US. The South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said that response would include US nuclear weapons, making explicit an element of the alliance that normally remains unspoken. The warning to Kim Jong-un’s regime came as Yoon and Joe Biden issued a joint declaration marking the 70th anniversary of the alliance, during a visit by the South Korean leader to Washington on Wednesday. “A North Korean nuclear attack against the US or its partners is unacceptable, and would result in the end of whatever regime took the action,” Biden said. “I have absolute authority, and sole authority, to launch a nuclear weapon, but what the declaration means is that we will consult with our allies, if any action is so called for.” The visit and the declaration have come at a time of increasing nervousness in South Korea about North Korea’s nuclear buildup, and calls for Seoul to develop its own nuclear arsenal. The Biden administration is seeking to reassure the South Koreans of the US’s security commitment, amid signs that the North has made significant advances in its weapons programme, despite years of international sanctions targeting the regime in Pyongyang. Concern over the threat posed by its neighbour has sparked a serious conversation in South Korea over whether the country should develop its own nuclear deterrent. Once considered a peripheral view, the idea of possessing nuclear weapons is now supported by most South Koreans, according to recent opinion polls. The South gave up its nuclear weapons programme almost 50 years ago when it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and officials in Washington are eager for that stance to continue, fearing that the peninsula could become the centre of a potentially dangerous arms race between North and South. But North Korea’s rapidly advancing weapons programmes - including ballistic missiles that can theoretically reach the US mainland – have added to concern in South Korea over whether the US would really use nuclear weapons to defend its ally under what it calls “extended deterrence”. Yoon, a conservative who has ditched his liberal predecessor’s policy of engaging with the North, earlier this year said his country was weighing developing its own nuclear weapons or asking the US to redeploy them on the peninsula. While Wednesday’s agreement will see the US and South Korea coordinate more deeply on a nuclear response strategy in the event of an attack by the North on its neighbour, nuclear weapons would remain under US operational control, while Biden made it clear that he was not contemplating the deployment of nuclear weapons in the South. “We are not going to be stationing nuclear weapons on the peninsula,” he said. In the declaration, Biden said Washington’s security commitment to Seoul was “ironclad” and that any North Korean nuclear attack on South Korea would be “met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response”. US extended deterrence, it said, was “backed by the full range of US capabilities, including nuclear”. The declaration also said the allies would consult more extensively “to defend against potential attacks and nuclear use and conduct simulations to inform joint planning efforts”. To underline the presence of the nuclear umbrella, US ballistic submarines armed with nuclear missiles will make port visits in South Korea for the first time since 1991. “Sustainable peace on the Korean peninsula does not happen automatically,” Yoon said. “Our two countries have agreed to immediate bilateral presidential consultations in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack and promised to respond swiftly, overwhelmingly and decisively using the full force of the alliance, including the United States’ nuclear weapons. “Deployment of strategic assets will be made constantly and routinely.” Derek Johnson, managing partner of the Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group, said the potential use of nuclear weapons by the US would only add to tensions in the region. “Nuclear weapons are a source of global insecurity and lie at the heart of the crisis on the Korean peninsula,” Johnson said. “Adding more of these weapons to the equation, even temporarily, will not make the United States or South Korea safer or more secure. This is far more likely to aggravate, rather than alleviate, pressures in the region, which could boil over catastrophically at any moment.” While Yoon is expected to use the declaration to try to persuade voters that Washington is taking South Korea’s concerns seriously, Jenny Town of the monitoring group 38 North said the declaration fell short of what some in the South had hoped for. It was “unlikely to either persuade North Korea off its current course of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] development and testing or to quiet the debate inside South Korea about its own nuclear future”, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-23T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"Recapturing excess heat could power most of Europe, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","fields":{"bodyText":"Excess heat produced across Europe could almost power the entire region but preventing this waste is largely being ignored as a solution to the energy crisis, say environmental experts. “The global energy crisis is a wakeup call to stop wasting energy,” said Toby Morgan, senior manager for the built environment at Climate Group, an environmental not-for-profit. “Now, more than ever, we need to make better use of the energy we already produce, we simply can’t afford to let it literally escape out the window. Energy efficiency improvements, like capturing and recycling excess heat, are absolutely critical to lower fossil fuel demand and lower bills.” A report published this week by the global engineering company Danfoss estimated that in the EU alone, excess heat was equal to 2,860 TWh a year, almost the same as the EU’s total energy demand for heat and hot water. Surplus heat is released into the air from a wide range of sources, including supermarkets, transport networks, data centres and commercial buildings. Much of this can be captured and used via existing heat recovery technologies, such as heat pumps, plus more efficient air conditioners and manufacturing machinery according to the authors of the report. Other solutions include improved urban planning and district energy systems based on networks of renewable energy supplies for both heating and cooling. Brian Vad Mathiesen, a professor in energy planning and renewable energy systems at Aalborg University, led the research cited in the report that builds on his team’s previous Heat Roadmap Europe projects. “The amount of cities, regions and countries in Europe which waste heat while spending billions on natural gas or electric heating is mind-blowing,” said Vad Mathiesen, warning that Europe’s energy security was at stake. “Take the Netherlands – there is virtually no district heating even though there is almost twice the amount of waste heat compared to the heat demand. Denmark is the same size but has towards 60% percent district heating with only one third of the population. The use of waste heat is certainly not connected to technical differences. While the physical laws are the same, the political will and traditions are very different.” There was “huge, unharnessed potential” to the excess heat produced by heavy industry, such as chemical manufacturing, steel and cement production. In the EU, that amounts to more than 267 TWh a year, more than the combined heat generation of Germany, Poland and Sweden in 2021. Data centres are also major consumers of electricity. In 2020, European data centres consumed about 3.5% of the region’s electricity demand, according to ReUseHeat, an EU project that explored barriers to urban heat recovery. The report highlights that the UK has an abundance of excess energy, including from 456 data centres. “That’s third most in the world, just behind Germany and the US,” explains Kim Fausing, the president and chief executive of Danfoss, who believes recycling heat is a crucial step towards a green transition. “If businesses were to harness all the excess heat from these centres, the emissions savings and revenue from selling this heat would be highly significant. In Greater London, we have identified at least 648 eligible excess heat sources, including data centres, underground stations, supermarkets, wastewater treatment plants, and food production facilities. Why aren’t businesses and local government organisations using these?” said Fausing, adding that London’s excess heat equated to 9.5 TWh a year, roughly the amount of heat required to heat 790,000 households. “Reusing excess heat offers incredible opportunities for businesses throughout the UK to reduce their emissions, save money and make money. What are we waiting for?” To rapidly tackle the energy crisis, Vad Mathiesen proposes a heat planning directive that enables local authorities to plan according to local conditions. This would involve mapping existing waste heat sources in greater detail, then proposing thermal networks that distribute heat more effectively and initiatives that improve energy efficiency in buildings. “Energy efficiency needs to be a top priority for any business or government, particularly during an energy crisis,” said Morgan, who advises every corporate net zero commitment to include a time-bound energy efficiency target, and for governments to incentivise the uptake of energy efficient technologies. “Energy efficiency improvements are climate critical. The time for action is now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"British households and firms cut enough peak-time energy use to power 10m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"Households and businesses in Great Britain moved enough of their energy use to non-peak times last winter to power 10m homes and help avoid blackouts. About 1.6m households and businesses received payments to help reduce the pressure on the National Grid during the winter months as part of a demand flexibility scheme run by its electricity system operator (ESO). The energy users were called on about 22 times to reschedule their energy use to avoid peak demand hours, for example, running dishwashers or tumble dryers at night. The energy savings from peak time were equivalent to the electricity output of the Keadby gas power plant over 4.5 hours, or three hours of generation from the Sizewell B nuclear power plant. In return, the households and small businesses received payments totalling millions of pounds through their suppliers. Octopus Energy said it paid a total of £5.3m to the customers who signed up. British Gas confirmed it made a total of £1.8m in payments to customers on behalf of the ESO. Claire Dykta, the ESO’s head of markets, said the scheme successfully demonstrated “the interest of UK consumers and businesses in playing a more active role in balancing our electricity needs”. She said: “We are now working with industry and consumers to establish how this world-leading service can grow from strength to strength and support the continued evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK.” ESO is expected to run the scheme again next winter. Countries across Europe took steps to reduce their energy consumption over the last winter after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused market prices to sky-rocket and raised fears over whether there would be enough gas imports to meet demand. Industry data has shown that Great Britain used 5% less gas in the first quarter of this year compared with the same months last year, in part because of lower demand for electricity overall and the growing fleet of windfarms. Wind turbines generated more electricity than gas-fired power plants for the first time in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis of ESO data by Imperial College London. The quarterly report, commissioned by Drax, showed that electricity demand fell by 4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. At the same time, wind power generation increased by 3% to make up 32.4% of Great Britain’s total electricity mix, while gas power made up 31.7%. Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and the lead author of the report, said: “There are still many hurdles to reaching a completely fossil fuel-free grid but wind out supplying gas for the first time is a genuine milestone event, and shows what can be achieved when governments create a good environment for investors in clean technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T11:10:48Z","webTitle":"‘There’s a lot of posturing’: Europe’s nuclear divide grows as one plant opens and three close","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","fields":{"bodyText":"When Europe’s first new nuclear reactor in 16 years came online in Finland, it was hailed by its operator as a “significant addition to clean domestic production” that would “play an important role in the green transition”. The opening last Sunday of the long-delayed Olkiluoto 3 plant, Europe’s largest, means about 40% of Finland’s electricity demand will soon be met by nuclear power, which the government says will boost energy security and help it achieve its carbon neutrality targets. Across the Baltic Sea and just hours before the Finnish plant came on stream, Germany was finally pulling the plug on its last three nuclear power plants, shutting down the steaming towers of Isar II, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II reactors late on Saturday. The environmental group Greenpeace, at the heart of Germany’s long-lived and powerful anti-nuclear movement, organised a party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. “Finally, nuclear energy belongs to history,” it proclaimed. There are few clearer illustrations of Europe’s nuclear divide. One faction, led by Germany, argues that the costs are too high and the risks – from reactor accidents and toxic waste – are, as the Green environment minister, Steffi Lemke, put it, “ultimately unmanageable”. Another, headed by France, argues equally forcefully that nuclear power is a reliable, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for electricity, and that phasing it out as Europe tries to meet vital green targets is ecologically damaging and economically senseless. The debate is not new. But with a third of the bloc’s nuclear reactors nearing the end of their original lifespan by 2025, and a legally binding aim of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, it is becoming increasingly intense. The energy shock that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, which brought an end to cheap gas imports and led Germany to briefly delay closing its last nuclear plants, has only entrenched the divisions. “There’s a lot of posturing,” the centrist MEP Pascal Canfin, who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “Different member states have made very different choices and have very different positions – and interests. “There’s scope for convergence and compromise. But given the sheer quantity of additional electricity we will need, both sides have to recognise we need every available solution … We have to take the politics and ideology out of this.” According to Eurostat, 25.4% of the EU’s electricity was nuclear generated in 2021, with 100-odd reactors in 13 member states. France, which has 56 operable nuclear reactors, accounting for just over half of that total. The divide across the bloc, though, is stark. If France has the highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (almost 70%), followed by Slovakia (52.4%) and Belgium (50.6%), others hardly touch it. The Netherlands stands at barely 3%. Germany’s opposition to nuclear goes back a long way; it was the main issue behind the launch of the country’s Green movement. Major accidents at Three Mile Island, Chornobyl and Fukushima reinforced an essentially ideological conviction. Advocates of its “Energiewende” green transition plan note that the 46% share of its electricity generated by renewables is far greater than the share that was produced by nuclear when its phase-out was first announced in 1998. While its plan, aimed at winning long-term public and industry support, will increase fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in the short term (coal is due to be phased out by 2038 or earlier), Germany argues it will also stimulate renewables growth. Immediate energy supply concerns meant public opinion swung against the shutdown last weekend, but polls before the war in Ukraine showed broad support for the principle. Other countries hold similar views. Several have already phased out nuclear, or plan to do so. Italy shut all its plants in 1990, after a 1987 referendum (in a 2011 plebiscite, held weeks after the Fukushima disaster, 94% of voters rejected a government plan to reintroduce nuclear power). Belgium was planning to close the last of its seven reactors by 2025, but recently extended the life of the two newest for a further decade, saying they were “critical to our energy security”. Spain aims to phase out its five active plants by 2035. Other opponents include Portugal, Denmark and Austria – which, along with Luxembourg, is suing the European Commission for classing nuclear energy as a “bridge technology” on the path to net zero, and thus as a “green” investment. In the French-led pro-nuclear camp, meanwhile, are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – which this year launched an alliance to boost nuclear cooperation within the bloc. Far from phasing out nuclear, Romania has doubled production in the last 15 years; Hungary and the Czech Republic have increased theirs by a fifth. Sweden is drafting a law to allow it to build more, while France aims to extend its plants’ life to 50 years and open at least six new ones by 2035. “Certain countries have made the extreme choice of turning their back on nuclear energy,” President Emmanuel Macron said when unveiling his plans in February. “Not France.” The country launched its nuclear programme after the 1973 oil crisis; a poll last year showed nearly 80% of voters support it, up 20 points from 2016. The nuclear standoff – at its most tense between France and Germany – has the potential to disrupt a range of vital EU projects, from changes to the bloc’s electricity market to the Green Deal programme supporting industry’s transition to net zero. For example, Paris and its central European allies have raged against a lack of support from Berlin for their efforts to have nuclear-derived hydrogen classified as “green” in EU legislation (so that it counts towards renewable energy targets). For Canfin, compromise will have to come through a general acceptance that renewable energy is “green” while nuclear energy is “low-carbon” – not fully green, because of its cost and risks, but also not “fossil”. “Text by text, we have to take the drama out of the question,” he said. “Behind the political slogans, there is starting to be convergence around the realities.” France and the “pro” camp now accept that only renewables are capable of boosting low-carbon electricity production short-term, Canfin said, while Germany is “evolving” to view nuclear as “part of the solution, not part of the problem”. A generational shift in Europe’s green movement – now driven more by concern about the climate crisis than, as was once the case, opposition to nuclear – should help, he said, with the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg criticising Germany’s shutdown as “a mistake”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-10T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Power play: the Lebanese board game with a political point to make","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","fields":{"bodyText":"In a dimly lit room in Beirut, five friends sit around a table with a map of Lebanon in the middle. They each have a handful of markers and a card placed face-down in front of them. The card, which has a drawing of a vintage chair on the back – symbolising power – determines the entire game. It assigns you the secret role of either “reformist” or “corrupt elite”. “It is just like in real life, you don’t know who is corrupt and who is not,” says Jean-Michel Chemaly, one of the developers of the board game. Machrou3 Ra2is: A Game of Corruption was released in December, giving people a chance to play the political game of Lebanon. The task is to control districts and, ultimately, win the presidential election – either through bluff or fair play. Chemaly says the idea came during the protests in 2019, when large numbers of Lebanese came out on the streets. A friend, Benoit Khayat, suggested that they create a game based on the politicians’ actions. “Every single society has people abusing power for their own benefit. We wanted to speak about it from a Lebanese perspective,” Chemaly says. The issues that people mobilised around in 2019 – corruption, accountability, justice – have become even more pressing. Lebanon has sunk deep into a financial crisis, with one of the highest levels of inflation in the world and a 98% depreciation of its currency. A fledgling anti-corruption movement has lost momentum. Millions have lost money, and are unable to access what little is left due to bank limits on withdrawals. As a consequence, 80% of the population face poverty, the UN estimates. Politically, the country is in a vacuum. In last year’s elections more reform-minded candidates than ever before ran for seats, and parties affiliated with the protest movement got 13% of the popular vote. But the country has been without a president since. In addition, no one has been charged for the huge explosion in the port of Beirut in August 2020, which killed more than 200 people. “We have absolutely no say in the politics of the country. Creating the game was a way of bringing about some agency,” says Rana Zaher, the game’s illustrator. Her aim was to make the game look like “something you would find in your grandma’s closet”. The map has a vintage feel, with stains and smudges. The characters from camp “reform” and camp “corrupt” all wear styles from the 1950s. One smokes a slim cigarette, another holds up a camera with a handheld flash. A man with a fez on his head poses with a vintage gun. “I won’t name any names but the characters are modelled after real political figures,” Zaher says. All the reformists are drawn in dark red, the corrupt characters in green. “Green symbolises sickness and death, and isthe colour of money, of course,” she says. The idea was to set the game in Lebanon’s golden age, and pose the question of whether circumstances then were setting the scene for the crisis today. “We wanted to know how we got to where we are today. You have to go back 100 years to find out what went wrong,” Chemaly says. It is not the first board game to look for new ways to explore politics and history. In 2019, Indian developers launched Shasn, Sanskrit for “governance”, where questions about ethics determine whether you’re an “idealist”, a “capitalist” or a “showman”. An updated version of the 2002 game Puerto Rico, which originally had players in the role of colonial governors, was released last year. The original game had faced criticism for its portrayal of colonialism, failing to include the experiences of people who lived through it. The new version is set in post-independence Puerto Rico. That game led to the creation of the “counter-colonialist” game Promesa, where players can learn about the Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. It is named after the 2016 law that handed control of the island’s finances to the US. Machrou3 Ra2is is on sale in shops throughout Lebanon and online, and has sold 500 copies so far. At a comic convention in Abu Dhabi in March, the team sold the game to visitors from Qatar, Australia and the Philippines. Chemaly says the game, which is in English, can be played by people anywhere to help people see what real life corruption looks like. “It depicts the struggle of every country in the world, people trying to make sure that the good guys get to power,” he says. Around the table, the game is drawing to a close. The final vote for president turns into an extended debate with everyone trying to call each other’s bluff– proof that it has been a good round, Chemaly says. “When it ends with a 30-minute discussion, you know you had a good game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/05/uk-us-or-a-hybrid-intense-speculation-as-australias-170bn-nuclear-submarine-choice-looms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"UK, US or a hybrid?

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, this week warned against opting for a new UK design. For now though, the Aukus submarine program is a “black box”, says Tom Corben, a foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “We’re just speculating until we get the announcement,” he says, adding that the secret has been very well kept, considering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is set to go to the US to announce it in March. And that speculation is running almost as hot as it was in 2016, when France, Germany and Japan were competing to build a replacement for Australia’s ageing Collins class fleet. France won, then lost in 2021 when the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, scuppered the plan to buy 12 of their conventional Attack class submarines in favour of the Aukus plan for “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. The conversation, when it started, was about whether Australia would buy a US or a UK boat. Both of their existing offerings are bigger than the Collins class, and require a bigger crew. Both of their nuclear reactors are designed to last the life of the boat, which can stay submerged until food or the crew’s patience runs out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But both countries are also already working on their next-generation submarines. The US is currently building 19 Virginia class submarines (known as SSNs, the US classification code for nuclear-powered attack submarines – as opposed to SSBNs, which are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines). These are more than 140m long and require a crew of 132. They displace (or weigh) more than 10,000 tonnes and carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. From the mid 2030s, the Virginia class will be replaced with the next-generation SSN(X). That “X” means the design hasn’t been finalised yet. The US navy has described it as an “apex predator” that will be faster, stealthier, and bristling with more weapons. The UK’s Astute class also carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, which allow the submarine to hit targets 1,000kms away and send back images of the battlefield. It also has Spearfish torpedos designed to destroy enemy submarines. It has a crew of about 100, is almost 100m long and has displacement of 16,000 tonnes. The UK, too, is thinking about the next generation. The SSN(R), which is still being designed, will replace the Astutes. In times of increasing uncertainty, the Aukus nations are looking for more capability. But the technical specifications are only part of the decision-making process for Australia, which is facing a capability gap as the Collins is set to retire before any new submarines are likely to be available. These are not submarines that can be plucked “off the shelf” from some global supermarket. The newer ones, still in the design phase, are years away from even starting trials. The older ones are desperately needed by their own navies. And the timelines are stretching out into the 2040s, leaving experts worried about how Australia will fill its capability gap. The US industrial base is almost overwhelmed constructing its own submarine fleets and there have been warnings that it could not stretch to helping Australia as well. “The bottom line is that the US is not going to build the subs on its own,” Corben says. That reinforces the idea that the endeavour will be split between the three nations. “I would have expected a US combat system to be part of this new submarine as a baseline assumption,” he says. “The real question is where the primary frame construction takes place. Some of that could conceivably happen in Australia if our shipbuilding capabilities are brought up to speed and capacity.” Increasingly the UK and Australian ministers have been hinting at a trilateral design, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, says. “The open question in my mind is whether that’s some version of the SSN(X) or SSN(R) or is it a new thing altogether,” he says. A totally new design would set off warning lights, he says, pointing to the problems Australia has had with Sea Sprite helicopters, the Collins class and the Attack class. “We’ve been down the road before of buying highly bespoke capabilities for our forces, which no one else has and it’s ended in disaster.” “It’s a price thing … it’s riskier as well because you’re doing something that hasn’t been done before.” Dutton, the former Coalition defence minister, used a series of media conferences and interviews this week to fire a pre-emptive warning shot against going for a new UK design. He said he believed the US Virginia class was the best choice for Australia because it was least risky and could be ready soonest. “I worry that if the government has taken a decision to go for a cheaper design that it will delay the delivery of those submarines,” Dutton said on Wednesday. The Labor government rebuked Dutton for his “irresponsible” public interventions – saying he was basing his views on out-of-date advice – and said it was important that Aukus remain a bipartisan endeavour. Despite airing those misgivings, Dutton promised to support the government’s eventual decision. Submarine analyst and past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, rear admiral (ret’d) Peter Briggs, says the SSN(R) is the frontrunner. The SSN(X) will be too big, he says. “The bigger it is, the more crew it carries and the more expensive it is to own.” Briggs points to the government’s emphasis on “at least” eight boats. “We’re a two-ocean country and we need six on each coast,” he says. “From six you have two ready to go at any time.” That’s the law of three, he says. At any point you have one out, one getting ready to go out, and one being serviced after having been out. Building 12 boats, he says, would make us an important enough customer that we could influence the design and perhaps restrict its size – the Collins class has a displacement of less than 3,500 tonnes and a crew of about 50. After Albanese announces where the new submarine will come from, some of the more difficult questions will need to be answered – about where the workforce will come from, whether everyone will willingly and easily share their technology, whether a hybrid build risks Australia’s sovereign control and – importantly – when the submarines will actually be ready."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"Russia claims Ukraine shelling Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The channel had been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the country’s critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where people have been marking the country’s Army Day today. Earlier we reported that the chair of Latvia’s broadcasting regulator, Ivars Abolins, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, TV Rain, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”. TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”. The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the country’s Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a “serious blow to freedom of information”. Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welle’s Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions. Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin. In a series of tweets, Gavrilița said justice would be carried out for “the innocent victims that died, were tortured and hurt during this cruel and unjust war unleashed by Russia”. She added: Ukraine is fighting for us all – for the freedom of the entire European continent. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted about his meeting with his Moldovan counterpart, saying that the pair had agreed to cooperate in air defence, energy and customer control. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said.

The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday.

Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I don’t know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. “It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,” he said. Read the full story here: The Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin, said shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city today. Kulemzin wrote on social media: Preliminary data shows that today six civilians were killed as a result of shelling in Donetsk, the number of wounded is being specified. Separately, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council. Maria Pirogova, who Pushilin said had been involved in the separatist movement since 2014, was “the epitome of kindness” whose life was ended “in its prime”, according to a tribute he wrote on his Telegram account. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached. The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry. The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin. A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover.

It desperately needs our support and we just cannot allow one member state to derail or delay this financial support. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The EU has promised to underwrite €18bn in cheap loans to Kyiv to keep Ukraine’s government afloat in 2023. The EU’s 26 other member states will now study how to move ahead without Hungary, although hope Budapest can be persuaded to change its mind. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Hungary, which has angered other member states with its sharp criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, may now find it harder to unlock EU funds. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, who chaired the meeting, said Budapest’s decision on €18bn for Ukraine would be considered alongside EU member state approval of Hungary’s coronavirus recovery plan. He added: The money will go to Ukraine: either it will be 27 or 26 member states that take part. We have to be able to send the money to Ukraine. The Green MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent critic of Hungary’s government, accused Orbán of abusing the veto like no one ever before. He said: He even takes funds for Ukrainian hospitals hostage for this … The EU will find ways to support Ukraine even without Hungary. But that means: more time, more effort, more costs. Viktor Orbán could not have given Putin a nicer present today. The centre-right Romanian MEP Siegfried Mureşan said the Hungarian veto was disappointing, adding: It is hard to regard this as anything other than cynical obstructionism. An American national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in July has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he does not have any identity papers. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.” Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said. Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday. He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations. “It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said. Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials. My colleague Dan Sabbagh quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out. The Guardian has seen evidence that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February. Hungary has vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year. The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds. The EU has sought to hold back some funds destined for Budapest because of rule-of-law breaches. The commission will now look at how to “provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January”, the EU’s budget commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said during a public session of the bloc’s finance ministers. Today’s Hungarian veto means decisions on other files on the finance ministers’ agenda – including a minimum corporate tax rate (which Budapest is also blocking), the Hungarian recovery plan and connected €5.8bn in grants, and the decision to freeze €7.5bn of EU funds for Hungary over corruption issues – were also postponed. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said: We were not able to adopt the package as a whole but we will not be discouraged. Our ambition remains that we will start disbursements to Ukraine in January. He asked the council to work on “a solution supported by 26 member states”, which would get around Hungary’s veto. The EU’s 27 nations have until 19 December to make a decision. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. Kuleba said Ukraine’s embassies in Romania and Denmark received such packages today. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the packages had been delivered to its embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Kraków, and the consulate in Brno in the Czech Republic. On Monday, Spanish police said they had intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefits from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, western Russia, 175 miles from the Ukrainian border. The governor of the region, Roman Starovoyt, said there had been no casualties and that the fire was “localised”. On Monday, Ukraine appeared to launch drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the attacks, but a senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times the drones involved on Monday were launched from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has confirmed that Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest series of swaps. Among those who were returned to Ukraine included dozens who had defended the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol, he said. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and warned of temporary difficulties in accessing its mobile app and website. The statement reads: The bank’s technological infrastructure is under an unprecedented cyber attack from abroad. The largest not only this year, but in the whole time the bank has operated. It added: An analysis of the DDoS attack indicates that it was planned and large-scale, and its purpose has been to interfere with the operations of banking services, VTB indicates. The majority of requests for bank services during the attack have generated from foreign segments of the internet, though there has also been malicious traffic from Russian IP addresses. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been visiting troops close to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy was pictured meeting soldiers and handing out awards to mark Ukraine’s armed forces day. In a Telegram post, the president thanked troops for their “resilience and strength”, describing them as “an outpost of Ukraine’s independence”. He added: I believe that next time we will meet in our Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 60 soldiers each in a prisoner swap today, according to Russian officials. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), wrote on Telegram: Another 60-60 exchange with Kyiv is taking place today. Shamsail Saraliev, deputy of the Russian state duma, wrote on his Telegram account: The Russian Ministry of Defence is conducting another exchange of prisoners of war today. Sixty Russian servicemen are returning home. The Russian defence ministry said it had returned 60 soldiers “who were in mortal danger”. My colleague Isobel Koshiw shares a video originally posted by the mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksii Reva, showing the extent of destruction in the key eastern Ukraine town. Russian opposition politicians are appealing to President Vladimir Putin to issue a decree to end the “partial mobilisation” that has seen hundreds of thousands of men called up to fight in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry announced in October the end to the military mobilisation order that Putin declared the previous month, but legal activists and media noted that only the Russian leader had the authority to end the mobilisation. The Kremlin said Putin would not sign any order, in effect allowing for future waves of mobilisation. The absence of a formal decree to cancel the mobilisation meant those already drafted could not leave the armed forces, according to Emilia Slabunova, an opposition councillor in Karelia in northern Russia. Military lawyers told Reuters that there were at least two cases where commanders refused to discharge servicemen. Slabunova said appeals against these refusals led nowhere, with courts siding with the commanders. She said: We, as councillors, represent our constituents and these appeals from us are the result of numerous appeals from citizens. Similar appeals were seen from opposition deputies in the Moscow, St Petersburg, Pskov and Veliky Novgorod regions, Reuters reports. All are members of the liberal opposition Yabloko party. The appeals said the lack of a decree “creates legal uncertainty” and “allows military commanders to deny citizens their discharge from service”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Blinken said President Vladimir Putin “started this war; he could end it tomorrow” and that there was “always an off-ramp” to end the war in Ukraine. He said: President Zelenskiy has said, we’ve said, others have said, that at some point this will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. And by that, I mean this: if Russia doesn’t succeed in its current gambit of trying to, in effect, get the Ukrainian people to throw up their hands – and again, they won’t succeed. In response to Blinken’s comments, Peskov said: That the outcome should be a just and durable peace – one can agree with this. But as for the prospects for some sort of negotiations, we do not see any at the moment. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Peskov was also asked about reports that Russia is set to launch a new wave of mobilisation of men to fight in Ukraine. As the BBC’s Will Vernon notes, the Kremlin spokesperson did not deny the reports. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Spanish police intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga, police sources close to the investigation said. Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. “Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. “In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,” he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”. “We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase in Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Russian Bastion systems, which have missiles with a flight range of up to 310 miles, were deployed on the island of Paramushir, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday. “Coastal servicemen of the Pacific fleet will keep a round-the-clock watch to control the adjacent water area and strait zones,” it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a Tuesday news conference that the government will closely monitor the Russian military activity, adding it has been intensifying in the far east regions in tandem with Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. Ukraine is working to restore power after Russia’s latest wave of missile strikes on Monday caused power disruptions across the country, as winter frost builds and temperatures plunge, AFP reports. Out of the 70 missiles launched by Moscow, most were shot down, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, but the barrage still hit Ukraine’s already battered infrastructure. Fresh power cuts were announced in all regions “due to the consequences of shelling”, national electricity provider Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The head of Ukrenergo said he had “no doubt that Russian military consulted with Russian power engineers during this attack”, judging by where the missiles landed. “The time that Russians chose for this attack was connected with their desire to inflict as much damage as possible,” Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told a Ukrainian news programme, explaining the attacks were launched as the country enters a “peak frost” period. “Our repairmen will be working on the energy system restoration.” The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU’s embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. While the market weighs the impact of sanctions on Russian supply, it was also watching a traffic jam of oil tankers off the coast of Turkey on Monday, with Ankara insisting on new proof of insurance for all vessels. A researcher at the investigative news outlet Bellingcat has posted video showing smoke rising from Kursk, Russia, where Ukraine launched strikes damaging an oil storage tank, according to the local governor on Telegram. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or report of an attack. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday, 6 December. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Below are the photographs originally posted by Starukh: Starovoyt did not specify where the drone originated. On Monday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine “attempted to strike” the Dyagilevo airfield in the Ryazan region and the Engels airfield in the Saratov region with “Soviet-made drones”. The drones were intercepted but debris fell and exploded on the airfields, the ministry added. It said that three soldiers had been killed and four others injured. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. A drone attack on an airfield in Russia’s Kursk region set fire to an oil storage tank, a local governor said on Tuesday. “There were no casualties. The fire is localized. All emergency services working at the site,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Yesterday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February.

It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Power of Language by Viorica Marian review – the virtues of multilingualism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","fields":{"bodyText":"Disclosure: this reviewer is pi-lingual, a word coined by Douglas Hofstadter to describe people who speak three languages and can also have a cringingly inept conversation with a taxi driver in a couple more. Any book like this one, which purports to prove scientifically that polyglots are superior, has my vote. All the more since no great diligence was required of me to achieve this, aside from tagging along with my parents and a couple of patient English girlfriends met at an impressionable age. I therefore picked up this account of the virtues of multilingualism in smug mode, channelling my son who, at age 7, was fond of starting conversations with strangers with “I speak three languages, how many do you speak?”, which unsurprisingly won him few friends. I was not prepared for the number of scientific reasons this (overlong) book provides for additional smugness and fewer friends. Viorica Marian, who was born in Moldova, speaking Russian and Romanian, immigrated to the US and is now a professor at Northwestern University, has clearly made a living out of making monolingual colleagues – which in her neck of the woods must be a majority – feel inadequate. The first half of The Power of Language is a relentless, and eloquently written, studies-have-shown gallop through her work and that of her peers. All of which supposedly demonstrates, ad nauseam, that polyglots are measurably better than monoglots at almost everything: smarter, more inventive, more adaptable. They also have less (and later) dementia, more emotional detachment in their learned languages, better “multisensory integration” and their brain has been literally reshaped by language. Some of the statements made are hair-raisingly daft – only a closeted academic could write: “Authors of a recent study suggest that the memory abilities of an 80‐year‐old woman with a bachelor’s degree would be on average as good as those of a 60‐year‐old woman with a high school education and interpreted the four extra years of education as making up for the memory losses associated with 20 years of ageing”. This is ivory tower tosh. University education has nothing in particular to do with memory, and memory loss with age very little to do with university education. Cultures with oral traditions demanded prodigious feats of memory from their storytellers and listeners, and awarded no bachelor’s degrees that I’ve heard of. The superiority of polyglots is supported by dozens of scientific articles reporting various clever experimental psychological tests and further articles measuring changes in blood flow in different areas of the brain using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI for short. None of this, by the way, tallies with my own experience. I have quite simply never noticed a difference in anything nontrivial between the people I know who speak many languages and those who do not. But science, according to Prof Marian, tells us otherwise. And that is where the problem lies, because the science may be bunk. Psychology and fMRI are both going through what is politely known in the trade as a “replication crisis” meaning that many studies claiming statistically significant results – effects that could not have arisen by chance – cannot be reproduced by other researchers. Much soul-searching is going on at the moment and the consensus is that practitioners need to up their game. Some of the field’s contradictions are evident in this book: all of fMRI is predicated on the notion that a brain area that performs a task lights up in the images produced by the machine. Yet Marian asserts “polyglots and hyperpolyglots used fewer neural resources to process language. [They] may be making more efficient use of neural resources for language processing”. In other words, if it lights up it’s working – and if it doesn’t light up it’s working even better. You see the problem. Midway through the book Marian switches gears from her area of expertise to a broader and shallower survey of language in general, which reads, at times, like a grab-bag of factoids.

The same proportion of the population, 70%, think the peace accord of 1998 has failed to deliver stable governance with the Stormont assembly not sitting for nine of the 25 years that have elapsed since the Belfast agreement was struck. The research was conducted by YouGov and Ohio State University for the House of Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee. That level of scepticism about the deal’s success in delivering stability remained consistent across age, religion and political affiliation. The committee chair, Simon Hoare, said the poll provided an “important snapshot” of current thinking in the region. The devolved government sitting in Stormont was created under strand one of the Belfast Good Friday agreement, which was considered an ingenious way of getting previously warring sides, republicans and loyalists to run the country together. Under the power-sharing system, elected politicians are required to self-designate as unionists, nationals or “other” to ensure laws could only be passed that worked for all communities. A quarter of a century on, and three-quarters of the respondents in the survey consider the requirement that key decisions have to have support from both nationalist and unionist sides gives the DUP and Sinn Féin an effective veto, with growing parties such as Alliance locked out. Stormont was collapsed for three years after a Sinn Féin walkout in 2017 and has been suspended for more than a year after the DUP pulled the plug in a protest over Brexit. Support for reform is widespread but Bertie Ahern, one of the architects of the peace deal, has said it could only happen once the DUP was back in Stormont. The party, led by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said it would not be “browbeaten” into a return and few are expecting it to resume power-sharing until September. Donaldson faced a cacophony of calls to return to Stormont in Belfast last week with leading figures involved in the peace deal, including Bill Clinton, urging politicians to face down “ugly” moments and “get the show on the road”. “I ask you not to be discouraged, this is human affairs, there are very few permanent victories or defeats in human affairs. All these old ugly problems are always rearing their heads. You just have to suck it up and beat it back and deal with it,” Clinton told a conference at Queen’s University."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T14:00:12Z","webTitle":"Mark Latham to push for nuclear plants and ‘parental rights’ if made NSW kingmaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","fields":{"bodyText":"Mark Latham will seek to overturn a longstanding ban on nuclear power technologies, strengthen “parental rights” and protect Christians from vilification if One Nation picks up enough seats to make him a kingmaker after the New South Wales election. The former federal Labor leader is attempting to grow his party’s upper house presence from two to four at the 25 March poll, capitalising on voter disillusionment and a loophole that has allowed him to resign and re-run at the top of the ticket. Pollsters and the major parties believe One Nation is in with a shot of picking up at least one extra seat – after securing two in 2019 – which means whoever forms government could have to work with, or around, One Nation to govern. Labor has preferenced the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in key marginal seats in the hopes of stopping One Nation from gaining more power, while the Greens remain nervous they could miss out on a seat to the party. Latham told Guardian Australia his top priority was building on conversations around the Aukus agreement to build nuclear-powered subs by getting around the decades-old federal nuclear power ban, enabling uranium mining and the building of reactors across the state. “I don’t advocate getting rid of the coal-fired power stations, but as the government’s doing it, it’s much much better to have small modular nuclear reactors replacing them,” he said. “The breakthrough on nuclear means it’s more urgent than ever.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Latham also said he wants parents to be given more rights over what their children are taught in schools, which he claimed were full of “semi-illiterate” students. “Parents are being treated as second-class citizens in the education system,” Latham said. “We would ban gender fluidity teaching in NSW schools … [as] the system seems to be obsessed with questions of gender, which has got nothing to do with education. It’s a matter for parents and families.” His third priority was increasing protection for religious groups to deal with the “rise of vilification of Christians, in particular”. But the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, accused Latham of being on a “unity ticket with the ‘teal’ candidates on their shared mission to remove conservative MPs to facilitate a Labor government” – a claim the One Nation leader and the opposition deny. “He pretends he’s a conservative,” Kean told Guardian Australia. Kean also dismissed Latham’s plan to see nuclear energy generation permitted in NSW. “I hope Mark understands that although he has an oversized voice for the number of votes his party attracts, his rantings in NSW parliament can’t be heard in Canberra, where there is actual jurisdiction to amend a commonwealth ban on nuclear power,” he said. Labor has denied doing deals with any crossbenchers, including Latham. “There’s a real possibility that Mark Latham and One Nation could be the kingmaker of NSW politics – on everything from climate change, renewables, education and anti-discrimination,” said an opposition spokesperson, Penny Sharpe. A pollster, Simon Welsh of RedBridge, said the Liberal party risked losing votes at each end of their support spectrum to teals and Labor, as well as more rightwing options. “That dynamic that was there in the federal election is definitely there again … [and] One Nation is very well-positioned – picking up folks that are angry with the government about vaccines and Covid restrictions,” he said. “The other thing that they’ve got working for them this time is that it looks like there’s a bit of consolidation of that rightwing minor-party vote. Whether that then translates into a number of seats is a trickier question.” A Greens spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said she was concerned about seeing far-right parties gaining ground. “The one way that we ensure that Mark Latham is not the kingmaker … is to get a commitment out of both government and the opposition that they will not work with the likes of One Nation because of the toxic politics they represent,” she said. “It is quite possible that that last spot in the upper house would be between [Greens candidate] Lynda-June Coe and One Nation.” The comments came ahead of Coe, a Wiradjuri and Badu Island woman, releasing the Greens’ plan to stop First Nations deaths is custody on Thursday. It will include co-designing and enacting a justice reinvestment plan, creating a new independent police and prison oversight mechanism and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14, with no one under 16 able to be sentenced to a jail term. Despite being just four years into his eight-year term, Latham last year announced he would quit parliament at the election, allowing the party to fill his vacated seat under parliamentary rules while he runs at the top of One Nation’s ticket. At the time Latham defended the run as a chance to “renew” his mandate but analysts believe he was using a loophole to increase the party’s chances of bolstering numbers to four, with one saying it raised ethical – but not any legal – concerns. The election analyst Ben Raue noted even if One Nation claimed four seats, the makeup of the rest of the chamber would decide the party’s actual power. “They could potentially have the balance of power but they could also be in a position where they’re just not that relevant,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/21/dup-urged-to-restore-power-sharing-in-northern-ireland-after-sinn-fein-poll-triumph","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T11:03:24Z","webTitle":"DUP urged to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland after Sinn Féin poll triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/21/dup-urged-to-restore-power-sharing-in-northern-ireland-after-sinn-fein-poll-triumph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/21/dup-urged-to-restore-power-sharing-in-northern-ireland-after-sinn-fein-poll-triumph","fields":{"bodyText":"The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) is facing renewed calls to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland after a Sinn Féin electoral “tsunami” reshaped local government. Chris Heaton-Harris, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, on Sunday joined a chorus urging the DUP to end a boycott that has paralysed the executive and assembly at Stormont. “Alongside the new councils, it remains my hope to see the assembly and executive return to work,” he said. Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and putative first minister, said her party’s performance in the 18 May council elections – final results were announced on Saturday night – reflected a desire to revive Stormont. “It is time to make politics work for all people and communities, and to build a better future for everyone,” she said. The appeals came after Sinn Féin made stunning gains and delivered what one former DUP leader said was a “wake up and smell the coffee moment” for unionism. In a contest for 462 seats spanning 11 councils, Sinn Féin swept past its unionist rival to become the dominant force in local government. It won 144 seats, a gain of 39 from the 2019 election when it won 105. It made breakthroughs across the region, including in DUP heartlands. The party almost doubled its vote in Balmoral, Belfast’s most affluent ward. The DUP won 122 seats, unchanged from four years ago. The non-aligned Alliance party won 64, a gain of 14 that vaulted it into third position. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) slumped to 54 seats, a loss of 21, and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) dropped to 39, a loss of 20. Smaller parties and independents made up the rest. On a turnout of 54.7%, a slight rise from 2019, Sinn Féin won 30.9% of first preference votes, versus 23.3% for the DUP, 13.3% for Alliance, 10.9% for the UUP and 8.7% for the SDLP. The results consolidated Sinn Féin’s success in last year’s assembly elections – when it eclipsed the DUP as the biggest party – and presented unionism with another reminder of its shrivelling demographic and political position. “For unionism, it’s perhaps a ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ moment,” the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the BBC. Naomi Long, the Alliance leader, called the result a “tsunami” of support for Sinn Féin. Nationalist parties won 19,000 more first preference votes than unionist parties, according to Nicholas Whyte, a psephologist with the consultancy Apco Worldwide. Sinn Féin tapped nationalist resentment at the DUP boycott of power sharing – which has blocked O’Neill from becoming first minister – by making her the focus of a presidential-style campaign that siphoned off SDLP support. However, the DUP’s solid vote reflected a tactical victory for its leader,Jeffrey Donaldson, who faced down challenges on both flanks from the moderate UUP and the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice. Boycotting Stormont to protest post-Brexit trading arrangements has been popular with unionist voters. However, Donaldson is believed to be seeking a way to revive power-sharing without losing face. There is speculation the DUP will do so in the autumn after obtaining further reassurances from Downing Street about Northern Ireland’s position in the UK and a financial package for the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-10T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"Japan’s climate policy ‘failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","fields":{"bodyText":"Apart from the distant buzz of a gardener’s strimmer, all is quiet at the Kyoto International Conference Center, its grey concrete walls matched by the sky on an afternoon in early December. Autumn leaves still cling to branches in the nearby forest, where groups of hikers plot their course in light trousers and T-shirts, as if to remind passersby of why Japan’s ancient capital became synonymous with the climate crisis. The venue – best known for its appearance in the 1974 Robert Mitchum film The Yakuza – is deserted. Its doors are locked and signs dotting its lawns warn non-authorised personnel to keep out. It is a far cry from the frantic activity of 25 years ago, when hundreds of journalists and campaigners, fuelled by coffee and takeaway bento boxes, awaited news of a breakthrough at Cop3 – the world’s first serious attempt to wean itself off fossil fuels. On 11 December 1997, after negotiations that ran through the night, the Kyoto protocol was born, committing 160 parties – later 192 – to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% between 2008 and 2012. The summit’s Japanese hosts hailed the agreement as a major breakthrough – the first time developed and developing countries had signed up to legally binding CO2 reduction targets. “Cop3 was a good start, because it showed that the world had to change,” said Kenro Taura, executive director of Kiko Network, a Kyoto-based NGO. “Until then, most countries were determined to pursue economic growth based around the use of fossil fuels, but Kyoto convinced them that was not the right approach.” The protocol was also an important step towards the Paris climate agreement. Derided by some as a failure because of the US refusal to ratify it, the agreement had some notable successes. It set out a global system of carbon trading, and in establishing many of the technical aspects of carbon accounting that are still in use, in modified forms, today. The “top-down” system of setting countries’ emissions-cutting targets has since been abandoned in favour of “bottom-up” commitments known as nationally determined contributions, but the understanding that rich countries must take responsibility for their historic role in the climate crisis endures, and was one of the flashpoints at last month’s Cop27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. “The Kyoto protocol is regarded as an important milestone in climate action, as it was the first opportunity for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Japan’s environment ministry said. “In response to the Kyoto protocol, Japan will drive emission reductions not only in Japan but also in developing countries where emissions have increased significantly, thus contributing to the global emission reductions.” The anniversary of the protocol, which came into force in 2005 – minus the US – passed almost unnoticed in its host city this week. Yet the absence of fanfare is misleading. In the quarter of a century since the summit, Kyoto city has positioned itself at the forefront of efforts to address climate change, even if Japan’s government has been found wanting. In 2019, Kyoto became the first Japanese city to announce a net zero target by 2050, and, in March 2021, the first to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an international campaign to move away from coal-fired power generation. In the two decades after Cop3, Kyoto halved the amount of waste it generated and cut energy consumption by 31%, according to Sayoko Matsumoto, manager of the city’s Do You Kyoto?project – named in honour of former German chancellor Angela Merkel, who used those words during a visit to the city in 2007 as a way of asking people if they were taking action to save the planet. Kyoto was one of four Japanese cities to be named to CDP’s A-List for 2022 in recognition of its “bold action” on climate change. On the 16th of every month, – the date in February 2005 when the protocol went into effect – outdoor lighting is dimmed or turned off, commuters are encouraged to swap their cars for public transport and diners eat in restaurants lit by candles and lamps. “The city feels a responsibility to lead on climate change, and that’s part of the legacy of Cop3,” Matsumoto said. “A lot of people in Kyoto may be too young to remember the actual summit, but they are aware of the climate crisis and the need to cooperate to help Kyoto achieve its net zero target.” Japan’s government, by contrast, has struggled to build on the Cop3 legacy. As of last year, renewables accounted for just over 20% of Japan’s energy generation – significantly lower than Germany (49% in the first half of 2022) and Britain (39%). Nuclear accounts for just under 7%, with coal, oil and liquefied natural gas dominating Japan’s energy generation with a 74% share. Its role in financing major oil, gas and coal projects earned Japan – the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of greenhouses gases – a “fossil award” from the Climate Action Network at the Cop27 summit. More than a decade after the Fukushima crisis forced Japan to close reactors and increase fossil fuel imports, the government is again turning to nuclear to help it achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, to the dismay of environmental campaigners who believe the focus should be on renewables. “The Japanese government is using the ‘we will do it with nuclear’ mantra as a way of delaying real work on climate change,” said Aileen Smith, executive director of Green Action. “Nuclear power is expensive,” Smith said, citing plans by Kansai Electric Power, which serves the region where Kyoto is located, to spend over ¥1tn (£5.9bn) over the next five years on climate change, with 70% of that investment earmarked for the nuclear sector. “It means money will be spent on a less effective, more expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions. And it won’t be that long-lasting, since the nuclear plants are old.” There was little evidence of any desire to burnish Kyoto’s legacy among the Japanese delegation at Cop27. Japan played a low-key role during the two-week conference, supporting moves to reaffirm the global target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but without taking a significant public stance on the issue. The country’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, did not attend the summit, putting him out of step with more than 100 world leaders who did. Taura said Japan’s enthusiasm for nuclear restarts and cautious embrace of renewables showed that Japan had “learned nothing” from the Kyoto protocol or the triple meltdown in Fukushima. “I think Europe has done more to take action that matches the spirit of the Kyoto protocol,” he said. “But Japan has consistently made the wrong choices. The decision to put increased nuclear power generation at the centre of its climate change policy is another setback to energy conservation and the promotion of renewable energy. Unfortunately, Japan has failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto.” • This article was amended on 12 December 2022. An earlier version referred to an “energy mix”.

Johnson on Monday met executives from major nuclear utilities and technology companies including the UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s EDF, and the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel to discuss ways of helping to speed up the development of new nuclear power stations. The UK generates about 16% of its power from nuclear power stations, but several reactors are slated for closure, while electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade. That would mean large investments in new power stations would be required just to keep the share of nuclear constant, let alone increase it to a record level of just over a quarter of electricity use. Also present at the meeting were a series of big pension companies and insurers, including Aviva, Legal &amp; General and Rothesay Life, alongside major foreign investors including Australia’s Macquarie and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Ministers have wrestled for years with how to attract private capital to invest in nuclear – but companies have balked at putting pension and insurance cash at risk. The government is considering changes to insurance rules set by the EU and copied by the UK to make it easier for insurers and pensions to invest. The UK is switching to a “regulated asset base” model, which it hopes will give long-term investors more certainty on returns, a change it hopes will address limitations to the current rules, known as Solvency II. The government wanted to show the nuclear and investment industries that it had a “clear ambition for more nuclear” in part to balance out intermittent renewable power sources, according to a government source briefed on the discussion. Scrutiny of the government’s energy policies has increased in recent months after unprecedented increases in fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the pressure, with oil and gas prices surging and western allies considering restricting energy exports as they try to isolate president Vladimir Putin’s regime. The prime minister last week met oil and gas executives to discuss increasing investments in the North Sea, and it is understood that he will next week meet executives from the offshore wind industry to discuss plans for further expansion of renewables. According to an aide who was present at the meeting, Johnson told industry heads and financiers that there had been a “chronic absence” of leadership by successive British governments on nuclear energy and that the country was “being left for dead” by other nations, such as France, on the issue. Speaking after the meeting, Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen our energy security as we move towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.” The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and geopolitical tensions making the government less keen on attracting Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast. Meanwhile the existing nuclear fleet has been in steady decline, with Hunterston B in Scotland retiring earlier this year, Hinkley Point B in Somerset due to follow suit in the summer, and Heysham I and Hartlepool I due to shut down in 2024. At that point, nuclear capacity is expected to fall as low as 3.6GW. A cross-party group of MPs that campaigns on nuclear issues has called for the government to increase its annual nuclear power capacity to 15GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2050, far above the 12.7GW installed at nuclear power’s peak in 1995. Major obstacles include difficulty in securing funding from private investors and a ban on new nuclear projects in Scotland, imposed by the devolved government, which prevents Hunterston B being replaced. The government is examining a plan to revise the financing model for major projects, which was among the factors that scuppered the Wylfa project in north Wales. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&amp;G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (Rab), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on Rab funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T01:42:48Z","webTitle":"Most Australian states face sharp power bill rises, despite government’s intervention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","fields":{"bodyText":"Power bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination, announced on Wednesday, is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The AER chair, Clare Savage, said the increases were “significant” but they could have been as much as 40% to 50% without the federal government’s intervention in December to cap domestic gas and black coal prices. The electricity price safety net, also known as the default market offer, is intended to set maximum increases for households and small business customers on standard retail plans in South Australia, New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Victoria releases its own default offer. In NSW, residential customers face price increases of as much as 23.7%, or 16.9 percentage points higher than the inflation rate. Those in south-east Queensland face increases of as much as 19.8% and residents in South Australia as much as 21.8%, the AER said. For small business customers, prices will increase between 14.7% and 25.4% depending on their region, the regulator said. Victoria also released its own draft decision for consultation, proposing the average annual bill for domestic customers on the Victorian Default Offer will rise 31.1%, with small business customers facing increases of 33.2%. “The draft decision proposes an increase of around $426 for residential customers, with typical bills increasing from $1,403 to around $1,829 per year,” the state’s Essential Services Commission said. “For small business customers, typical bills would increase by around $1,738, from $5,620 to around $7,358 per year.” The AER said customers should shop around to minimise the increases. “Based on offers available in February 2023, residential customers switching from a standing offer to the lowest market offer could save 7% to 17% and small business customers could save 9% to 26%, depending on their region,” the regulator said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Savage told ABC’s Radio National: “It’s not as bad as it could have been.” The federal government legislated to cap wholesale gas prices temporarily at $12 a gigajoule and cap coal prices at $125 a tonne, a move Treasury estimated would save the average households $230 on their electricity bills in the next financial year. The AER said forward contract prices for the 2023-24 financial year had begun to fall in south-east Queensland and NSW “as soon as the intervention was publicly mooted”. “Contract prices have now fallen by approximately 50% since the end of October,” it said. “However, despite this significant decline, the trade-weighted average prices for 2023-24 contracts are around $40 per megawatt-hour higher than they were at the start of 2022 in all regions.” On Monday the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said he expected the default offer to be “significantly lower than the AER’s predictions” before the government’s intervention in December. In November the AER advised that, without action, the residential default offer would increase by between 35% and 44% in NSW, 51% in South Australia, and 41% in south-east Queensland. Bowen revealed that the government estimated small business customers were on track to pay 37% more in NSW, 53% more in South Australia and 50% more in south-east Queensland. “We simply had to act,” he told the Sydney Institute. “But I know that will be cold comfort for people who will still have to deal with the resulting energy bill increases.” On Wednesday, Bowen said households would avoid increases of $268 – $530 because of the intervention. The savings for small businesses would reach as much as $1,243. Bowen noted that the government would deliver $1.5bn of energy price relief rebates, expected after the May budget. The Coalition’s energy spokesman, Ted O’Brien, said the higher prices were evidence of a “broken promise reconfirmed”, with more than 82,000 households now on hardship programs. “Energy bills have skyrocketed despite Labor’s promise of a $275 reduction and now they are set to soar even higher,” O’Brien said. “It’s further proof that Labor’s energy plan is failing.” Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, called on Victoria’s Essential Services Commission to “think again” about its “problematic” recommended price increase. “They average contract prices over a 12-month period and so their calculation reflects the surge in contract prices from around June to October last year,” Mountain says. “But there is little evidence to suggest that these contract prices represent the costs that retailers will incur over the coming 12 month period,” he says. The result is that the increases - if maintained in the final decision - would “needlessly deliver large windfall profits particularly for Victoria’s large retailers, at customers’ expense”. “This is contrary to the government’s stated objective in introducing the VDO.” Data from Energy Action shows Victoria’s wholesale power prices jumped from the middle of last year but not as much as states to the north. The commission said wholesale power costs were up 95% from the 2022-23 year, and made up about 36% of the annual domestic bills. The Victorian government said households would still continue to pay less on average for their electricity than residents in south-east Queensland, NSW and South Australia. “We know that Victorian households are facing real pressures because of the increasing cost of energy globally,” said a spokesperson for the energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. “That’s why we’ve fast-tracked a new round of the $250 power saving bonus and encourage Victorians to access our rebates for solar PV and hot water systems. “We’re also reducing our reliance on costly fossil fuels – that’s why we’re bringing back the State Electricity Commission and replacing unreliable, privatised coal with clean, government-owned, renewable energy.” The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the government should explain why the proposed increase was larger for Victorians than elsewhere. “Four years ago, [premier] Daniel Andrews promised Victorians that he would reduce power prices through a default market offer,” Pesutto said. “Well today, he’s broken his promise and he owes Victorians an explanation for why they are paying more for energy prices than people living in other states around our country. People are doing it hard. They need relief, not energy price increases when they can least afford it.” Cassandra Goldie, chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the latest increase would land as a blow for consumers after increases of 20% last year. “People on the lowest incomes do not have anything left in their budgets to cut back on and are at breaking point,” Goldie said. ACOSS wants the federal government to adjust the AER’s guidelines for the default offer to lower retail margins as has been done in Victoria. The chief executive of Energy Consumers Australia, Lynne Gallagher, said as many as half of households could be missing out on assistance that they are eligible for, often because of red tape. “Retailers know when customers are not on the best deal and we’d like them to be more proactive in reaching out to offer them the best possible option,” she said. After consultation, the AER will issue its final default offer for the year in May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-27T00:01:16Z","webTitle":"Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Australian midwives should have power to prescribe medical abortions and contraception, inquiry hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian midwives are calling for expanded roles, including prescribing medical abortions, as they warn of “abortion deserts” where women cannot access the healthcare they need. In an inquiry hearing on Friday, midwives are also set to call for broader rights to prescribe contraceptives. The Greens’ leader in the Senate and spokesperson on women, Larissa Waters, introduced the motion for a Senate committee inquiry into universal access to reproductive healthcare after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Dr Zoe Bradfield, a senior research fellow at Curtin University and vice-president of the Australian College of Midwives, said midwives were “ready to go”. “Midwives are scoped to provide life-course care from menarche to menopause and everywhere in between,” she said. “All of the screening and diagnostics for pregnant people are often relevant for non-pregnant people. “We’re in the middle of a gender-based violence crisis … the screening midwives do for family and domestic violence, we’re already really good at that.” In its submission, the Australian College of Midwives (ACM) wrote that a broader presence in primary care could allow them to deliver to their “full scope”. The midwifery workforce is an “under-utilised resource that, if enabled, could play a crucial role in providing universal access to reproductive healthcare and women’s health underpinned by women’s choice and autonomous control”, the college wrote. “Endorsed midwives are already living and working in the identified ‘abortion deserts’ of Australia. “By undertaking the same credentialing and training required by medical practitioners (currently not available to midwives), these midwives will improve access and quality of care for women.” The college described abortion deserts as places “where women are unable to access the limited number of medical practitioners qualified to perform abortions and/or pharmacists to prescribe medical abortion”. That leads to limited access and long wait times, increasing the chances of poor outcomes, while midwives are “ideally placed to provide prescriptions for those seeking medical abortion”. The college also said the federal government should consider making the contraceptive pill, condoms and intrauterine devices free for those under 25 and allow midwives to prescribe contraceptives. Of 36,000 registered midwives, only 908 are endorsed (after extra study and 5,000 hours practice) to prescribe contraceptives and even then only a limited number are on the PBS. According to the submission, midwives would particularly help in rural, remote and Aboriginal communities. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Midwives Australia, which represents midwives in private practice, said midwives worked in a range of settings including homes, communities and health units and provided a range of services including sexual health and education. It said women’s access to “termination of pregnancy services across regional, rural and remote areas” is “highly problematic and below the expected standards for a first world nation”. In New Zealand, midwives play key roles not just in pregnancy, birth and post-birth, but also in medical abortions and the prescribing of contraception. “Unfortunately, in Australia the role and potential of the midwife is not fully realised,” MA wrote, adding they were not seen as “essential in public health strategy”. Midwives Australia called for a “whole of life approach”, for it to be easier for midwives to qualify to prescribe contraceptives and for legislative change so midwives could prescribe and provide medical terminations. The Nursing and Midwifery Federation also called for the removal of barriers for both nurses and midwives, as well as support for measures including providing contraceptive implants, hormone replacement therapy, termination counselling, and STI testing. MS Health, a non-profit pharmaceutical body that is part of MSI Australia, has applied to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to expand the number of eligible prescribers and therefore expand access. MS Health would like to see nurses, midwives, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healthcare workers able to prescribe medical abortions. The assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, said everyone deserved access to “equitable and appropriate sexual and reproductive healthcare”. “We know there are barriers to access for women seeking terminations or contraceptive options across Australia – be that geography, cost, lack of awareness for consumers or a lack of training or education among health practitioners,” she said. The committee is due to report on 11 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/15/turning-out-the-lights-what-is-the-legacy-of-the-liddell-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T15:00:16Z","webTitle":"Turning out the lights: what is the legacy of the Liddell power station?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/15/turning-out-the-lights-what-is-the-legacy-of-the-liddell-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/15/turning-out-the-lights-what-is-the-legacy-of-the-liddell-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Jackson Channon, an electrician at the Liddell power station, counts “three generations of generation” who worked at the Hunter Valley site, including a grandad who drove cement trucks used to build it and parents who first met while on staff. Come 29 April, Channon will attend the closure of the AGL Energy coal-fired facility, joining hundreds of current and former staff, community members and even artists marking the end of what was Australia’s biggest power plant when it was built 52 years ago. “They’re not such good jobs when you’re covered in coal and ash and all the other sort of stuff out there,” he says. “Once it closes, it will definitely be something to think about, the family aspect of it.” Channon will be one of about 100 Liddell workers who will transfer to the nearby Bayswater power station, both bought by AGL for $1.5bn from the New South Wales government in 2014. The remaining 40-odd crew will retire or leave the industry. In 2015, AGL declared a 2022 closure target for Liddell, a power station dogged by frequent breakdowns including 23 restarts last year. It relented to pressure from the Turnbull government – which included lobbying AGL’s board to sell the plant to rival power generator, Alinta – to extend its life a year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup As part of its defence, AGL even ushered journalists through the dingy, dusty and noisy “old lady Liddell” in 2018. Kate Coates, the plant’s general manager at time, displayed a smörgåsbord of pulverised or shredded piping, telling visitors: “We can’t ask [her] to run a marathon a few days in a row without her falling over.” Initially generating 2,000MW at full tilt, it was downgraded to 1,680MW. With one of its four units shut last April, the plant has been typically generating at closer to 750MW lately, according to data group WattClarity. Excluding rooftop solar panels, NSW has almost 20,000MW of generation capacity prior to Liddell’s exit. The mammoth multi-year demolition operation to turn the site “cool, dark and dry”, as staffers say, has already begun. Liddell’s two towering smokestacks will be toppled and its eight-metre thick concrete base excavated and crushed on site. AGL expects more than 90% of the materials will be recycled, including 70,000 tonnes of steel, more than the metal used in the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Perhaps more difficult will be disposing of hundreds of thousands of litres of waste oil, acids and sludge and finding uses for a 200-hectare dam containing 39m tonnes of coal ash. Before then, though, the company will be working to ensure the plant continues to operate safely until its large turbine stops spinning on 28 April. Jarred Burns, who began his 23-year career at Liddell as an apprentice, expects a “mixture of emotions” when he turns up for that final shift. He’ll “be a bit relieved if it all goes out to plan … to make sure that it does do what it’s meant to do”. Veteran worker Graeme McNeill said ageing equipment was a major cause of an incident that left him “pretty badly burnt” several years ago. Hearing the tell-tale rumblings of a transformer overheating, he fled “as briskly as I could” but not before it exploded, spraying him with superheated oil. McNeill was flown by helicopter to Sydney’s Royal North Shore hospital, where he was treated for almost a fortnight. “It was very painful and a challenging recovery” he says, adding he enjoyed his job and was keen to return to work soon afterwards, confident that implemented changes would prevent a repeat of the incident. Rehabilitating the site itself won’t come cheap. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, said AGL has set aside $1.5bn for the clean-up of its four remaining large generators: Liddell and Bayswater in the Hunter Valley, Torrens Island near Adelaide and Loy Yang A in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. According to AGL’s 2022 accounts, the twin Hunter plants face $687m rehab costs alone. One person knowledgable about the liabilities says the tab will probably exceed $1bn. “The assumption is that all of this has to go,” the person said. Brokhof says the ash dam may end up being the most costly part. According to the Hunter Community Environment Centre, Liddell’s coal ash totals 39m tonnes. Bayswater, presently slated to close by 2033 at the latest, adds another 45m tonnes. Heavy metals including selenium, lead and arsenic have all been detected in Lake Liddell, says Jo Lynch, the centre’s coordinator, during a recent walk along the shores of the lake. “The contamination is severe.” “There have been no plans stated for Lake Liddell,” Lynch says, with contaminants leaking in to the groundwater from the ash dump, and directly from the plant’s outfall. AGL’s interest in an ash reuse plant seems to have waned. “There’s not enough money for that,” she adds. Analysis by Environmental Justice Australia of data from the National Pollution Inventory shows Liddell power station recorded a 170% increase in mercury pollution from 16kg in 2021 to 40kg in 2022. Bayswater was the worst plant in the state, with mercury pollution reaching 112kg, Jem Wilson, an EJA spokesperson, said. “Mercury is a neurotoxin, which means it can damage the nervous system, brain and other organs of humans and animals,” Wilson said. It is also a persistent toxic element – which means that once it is present in water, it is there to stay. One hoped-for environmental benefit from Liddell’s closing will be the eventual reopening of Lake Liddell to swimming and waterskiing. AGL closed it “permanently” in 2016 after detecting the brain-eating amoeba Naegleria fowleri, possibly spawned by the unnaturally warm waters pumped out of the power station. The amoeba can cause infection in humans through the nasal sinuses. Potentially fatal cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis are associated with jumping or falling into water, actions that can force water into the nose under pressure, according to a fact sheet pinned to a wall at a lakeside changing rooms. The closure of a plant that was recently emitting 8m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year will also be a benefit, Lynch said. “From a climate perspective, we’re pleased to see the first closure happening.” Despite his incident, McNeill, who has also served as councillor for the local Muswellbrook shire for more than a decade, remains very fond of the power station. “[It] has been such a backbone for the area in terms of economics, and the state as a reliable supply of electricity”, he says. Employees – including McNeill’s son – are proud of the role they have played in “keeping the lights on” in NSW and beyond. “We all feel an obligation, in maintaining supply, working at Liddell,” he says. “Liddell has done this job. That’s its legacy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: ultra camera, ultra power, ultra price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","fields":{"bodyText":"The Galaxy S23 Ultra is Samsung’s latest and greatest power-house smartphone with a more impressive chip, battery and camera than its predecessors. But do the improvements justify such a steep price? At £1,249 ($1,199/A$1,949), which is £100 more than last year’s model, it is one of the most expensive non-folding smartphones available. The S23 Ultra is the spitting image of its predecessor, an extremely solid and premium-feeling device and looks really good in cream, as pictured. It has the same super-bright and crisp screen, same aluminium frame and slightly less curved glass at the edges. One of the S23 Ultra’s unrivalled features is the fan-favourite S Pen stylus, which was added to the S series last year and receives only minor changes. It is a similar story for the software, with the phone running Samsung’s One UI 5.1, which is based on Android 13. It is packed with useful features, including productivity tools for the S Pen, and more customisation options for the lockscreen. The new phone will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches. Samsung has dramatically improved the speed and availability of updates for older devices over the past couple of years, which means most of its top line of phones made in the past few years are already running One UI 5.1. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 now worldwide Unusually for Samsung, all Galaxy S23 models use the same top Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip from Qualcomm regardless of where they are sold. In the past, most regions, including the UK and Europe, used Samsung’s own slightly weaker chips, while the US used Qualcomm’s. The new chip is therefore a bigger deal to consumers in Europe, not only boosting general and gaming performance by up to 35% but running much more efficiently, staying cooler under heavy workloads and extending battery life considerably. The S23 Ultra lasts more than 52 hours between charges, making it one of the longest-lasting smartphones I’ve tested alongside Apple’s iPhone 14 Plus. That was with the screen actively used for more than six hours and at least an hour spent on 5G a day, the rest of the time on wifi. Heavy gaming sessions reduced the battery life, but the phone survived even the heaviest days of general usage with about 30% left in the tank. I have no doubt almost three-day battery life is possible with more frugal use. Turning off the always-on display adds roughly 10% to the battery life. Specifications Main screen: 6.8in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (500ppi) 120Hz Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 RAM: 8 or 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: One UI 5.1 based on Android 13 Camera: Quad rear: 200MP, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x and 10x telephoto; 12MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins) Dimensions: 163.4 x 78.1 x 8.9mm Weight: 233g Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost about £260, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Samsung offers a self-repair programme in the US, but not in the EU or UK. The phone scores up to 6 out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking. It contains recycled material in 12 components – double last year’s number – including aluminium, glass and plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Camera There are four cameras on the back of the phone and a good 12-megapixel selfie camera at the top of the screen. As with the previous two Ultra generations, the four-camera array includes 3x and 10x optical zoom telephoto 10MP modules, which are excellent and allow a far greater range of zoom than any rival. Images up to 30x zoom look as good as most other phones manage at less than 10x. The 12MP ultrawide produces excellent landscape and architecture shots and is used for Samsung’s very good macrophotography mode when up close. New for this year is a 200MP main camera, which uses the first of a new generation of sensors with just under double the pixel count of previous models. By default it uses the data from all the pixels to increase captured light and detail, producing 12MP images that are some of the very best available across a range of light levels. The phone can also shoot at 50MP or the full 200MP, the latter producing huge image files with an amazing amount of detail in bright light. They lack the dynamic range of 12MP shots, however, as they lose some of the advanced processing. Low-light mode is slightly better overall and produces generally well exposed images, though is needed less as the camera gathers more light to start with. The camera app is packed with advanced and fun features, including a full RAW shooting experience for those looking to do their own editing and the most capable video on Android. Samsung’s portrait photography, particularly at its 3x zoom, is class-leading on natural look and fine details such as flyaway hairs. Compared with the S21 and S22 Ultra from the last two years, the S23 Ultra offers only incremental upgrades across the entire camera system. But that has kept it the most capable camera on any smartphone available, and is about the only one I would consider to be able to replace the utility of a dSLR or equivalent with its full range of optical zoom. Price The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra costs from £1,249 ($1,199.99/A$1,949) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the Galaxy S23 costs £849, the S23+ costs £1,049, the Z Fold 4 costs £1,649, the Google Pixel 7 Pro costs £749 and the iPhone 14 Pro costs £1,099. Verdict If ever there was a phone worthy of the “ultra” moniker, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is it. The phone is unrivalled in size, power, capability and battery life on Android, while its camera is more capable than any other on the market. It is very much overkill for most, but for those who would like the ability to do more or less anything with a phone, the S23 Ultra has the goods. It is full of little improvements to almost every aspect. However, it only builds on big leaps made two years ago and is overshadowed by more innovative folding devices. Its very high price makes it poor value next to the Google Pixel 7 Pro, which cannot match the Samsung on every element but comes close enough for £400-£500 less. It is without doubt the best Android phone available. Whether that’s enough to be a hit at this price any more, I’m not sure. Pros: very big 120Hz screen, brilliantly capable camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, good software with five years support, faster fingerprint scanner, S Pen stylus, top performance, very long battery life, contains recycled materials. Cons: huge, heavy, extremely expensive, S Pen may be superfluous feature for many."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T14:58:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 338 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. Federal prime minister Alexander De Croo said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. The ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said “Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable.” Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian Embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports.

The ground lost to Borussia Dortmund between 2010 and 2012 was spectacularly recaptured, along with many of the rival club’s best players. The abortive reign of Carlo Ancelotti in 2016 seems to have warned the club hierarchy off the allure of the star foreign manager. And the remarkable chain of events that has reconfigured the landscape of German football over the past fortnight may just have its origins in Bayern’s failed pursuit of a promising young coach called Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel had been on Bayern’s radar as early as 2014, when Pep Guardiola began to recommend the Mainz coach as a potential successor. Cordial meetings were held with the sporting director, Michael Reschke, and the club president, Uli Hoeness. But it was in 2018, when the veteran coach Jupp Heynckes announced his retirement, that the chase really began. Heynckes publicly anointed Tuchel as his chosen successor and talks were arranged. But Bayern were too late. Tuchel had made up his mind to go abroad, and would soon be unveiled as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain. If Julian Nagelsmann was unnerved at the prospect of Tuchel returning to the job market, he did a good job of hiding it. As his Bayern squad broke up for the international break after the 2-1 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, there was little portent of the approaching chaos. “Everyone come back healthy from the internationals,” Nagelsmann warned his team in what would be their final meeting together. “And then we’ll smash Dortmund!” At which point Nagelsmann went skiing in the Austrian Alps with his girlfriend. He would only find out late on the Thursday night via media reports that his job had been given to Tuchel. It seemed logical enough, even if the shock value at the time was real. Beat Dortmund at the Allianz Arena this Saturday – as they have done in each of their last eight meetings at home – and Bayern will return to the top of the Bundesliga, presumptive favourites to win their 11th title in a row. This season’s Champions League has produced eight wins out of eight. But then raw numbers have never kept any Bayern manager safe. This is a club where coaches are hired and fired largely on feel and projection, the vague but compelling idea that some basic essence has been lost. “This is not what Bayern stands for,” the current sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said scornfully after the defeat to Leverkusen, and in retrospect this was the point at which we should have realised that change was coming. And something has undoubtedly been slightly off at Bayern this season, even if it is hard to pin down exactly what. There were few signs of dressing-room disaffection, and indeed over the international window many Bayern players expressed their surprise at Nagelsmann’s sacking. Certainly results since the World Cup have been substandard, allowing a surging Dortmund to go top for the first time in almost four years. Eleven points dropped from winning positions hints at a certain brittleness and an occasional tendency to concede soft goals. But there is nothing like a smoking gun here. Indeed, the timing of Nagelsmann’s sacking seems to be intrinsically linked to Tuchel’s availability, and the fear of losing out on him again with Tottenham and Real Madrid circling. All of which, coming days before a crucial title showdown against Dortmund and a Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City, raises certain pressing questions. Has the ultimate long-term process club just had a massive short-term spasm? Has the club that like to plot out their managerial changes years in advance succumbed to the sugar-fix of the new-manager bounce? “It’s not the time for big changes in systems or tactics,” Tuchel said at his Bayern unveiling, and the urgency of the tests ahead suggests that pragmatism will define his early weeks in the job. The short-term priority will be to strengthen a defence that has kept just two clean sheets in its past 10 games, which suggests the three-man defence he employed at Chelsea may well be repeated on Saturday. There are intentional parallels here with his spell at Stamford Bridge, during which he won the Champions League within his first six months of taking the job. That run was also based on a remarkable defensive record, with two central midfielders screening the back three and allowing the wing-backs to press high up the pitch. The obvious point to make here, and one borne out by Tuchel’s body of work at Mainz, Dortmund and Paris, is that clearly he is better than a stop-gap coach. But how much better? Man for man, Bayern’s squad bears comparison with any in Europe, from João Cancelo and Matthijs de Ligt in defence, to Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka in midfield, to the array of riches in the final third. A new goalkeeper and a No 9 are probably needed soon, but this is not a team in desperate need of a rebuild. In short: if ever there were an opportunity for Tuchel to put down roots, to articulate a long-term vision, to prove his staying power, this is it. For all the haste of his arrival, he finds himself in the extremely rare position of having time on his side. Even a failure to win the Bundesliga or Champions League this season will probably not be held against him. Barring abject disaster, he should get at least a year to build the team he wants. There may be a certain irony in this, but a short-term punt on a short-term coach may just have given Bayern their best shot in a while at long-term stability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-02T23:01:53Z","webTitle":"Luxury and Power review: boozed-up Persians and Greeks on a 500-year bender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","fields":{"bodyText":"A pair of sculpted heads stare at each other at the start of this exhibition: an ancient Persian with a square beard and tight ringlets facing up to the Greek god Apollo. Here is a polarity that has defined global history. The struggle between the Greek city states and the Achaemenid empire was believed by the Greeks to be a fight to establish who they were: western, not eastern, self-governing, and democratic in the case of Athens, as opposed to the playthings of Persian tyrants. But guess what – the reality was more complicated. The Persian portrait and the Chatsworth Apollo, as it’s known, are not so different. Both come from 5th century BC Cyprus, and are associated with sanctuaries where Apollo and the Persian god Reshef were jointly worshipped. One thing this exhibition in the BM’s compact Great Court gallery has going for it is clarity. It covers 500 years of Persian and Greek history but instead of an epic, exhausting saga it is more like a brief introduction centred on the theme of luxury. That is a key word in classical historical and political texts, the flaw that corrupts and destroys societies, associated with the east and Persian power. To suggest it, the gallery has been swathed with white draperies and faux columns like a tackily overdone Greek restaurant, or maybe a shop selling repro antiques. There are three sections: a sort of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. First, we get a taste of the Persian empire, including a relief of Darius I worshipping Anubis in Egyptian style. Then we see how classical Athens wrestled with Persian artistic influence even as it mocked the defeated empire. Finally, the two cultures merge as Alexander the Great conquers Persia yet embraces its ways. The wars that ancient historians made so much of are relegated to small connecting displays – a Hoplite helmet, sounds of clashing weapons, that’s your lot. It’s more surprising that such short shrift is given to “the Greek historian Herodotos”. It’s oddly pedantic to insist on the Greek version of his name when he’s been famous for centuries as Herodotus. And strange to marginalise the father of history: Herodotus didn’t just tell of Persia’s invasion of Greece and its failure, but also explored the cultures of much of the Greeks’ known world, perhaps even visiting Babylon to research and listen. Herodotus brings history to life, which this show refuses to do. Rejecting all that Herodotean stuff, it instead centres on a history of cups. At the heart of each section are huge, luxurious drinking cups known as rhytons. Shaped like horns, made of gold or silver, these Persian banqueting vessels feature bulls, griffins and human portraits. They must have been fantastic to drink from. But they are not very moving to look at. In classical Athens, full of cocky democratic self-consciousness after seeing off the mighty Achaemenid army, it was considered vulgar and ostentatious to drink from a bulbous golden horn. So rhytons were made out of clay. A display of drinking cups from 5th century Athens shows how ceramicists and painters turned the opulent Persian rhyton into pottery in the shape of ram and pig heads, painted red, white and black. Surely this all confirms the traditional view that Greek and Persian culture were opposites. Athens in the 5th century BC was so rich it could afford a gigantic ivory statue of Athena, covered in gold, to stand inside the new Parthenon temple, rebuilt after the Persians had sacked the Acropolis. Yet the classical style that crystallised at this time was simple and austere, rejecting Persian magnificence. A section of the Parthenon frieze in the exhibition depicts young Athenian women carrying Persian objects as tribute in the Panathenaic procession: but artistically this masterpiece owes nothing to Persia. The show can’t actually demonstrate anything like as much Persian influence as it wants to. Persians instead appear as the foils of Athenian self-confidence: one drinking cup is shaped into a caricature of a grimacing, defeated “Persian”. Things flare into life when Alexander the Great comes on stage, though. Born in Macedon in 356 BC, Alexander defeated Persia, burned its great capital Persepolis, and created a new Greek empire from Egypt to Afghanistan. Now cultures really did mingle. An Egyptian statue from the 4th century BC looks completely Pharaonic but it’s a portrait of one of the Greek rulers from whom Cleopatra descended. This Hellenistic era comes across as a fascinating, seductive cultural melting pot. At the heart of the Hellenistic delights are gold drinking cups and platters from the Panagyurishte Treasure, exquisite Thracian objects lent by Bulgaria’s National Museum of History. They brilliantly combine Greek and Persian themes in an aesthetic free-for-all. A drinking horn has a classical frieze, naked gods and demigods sport on cups with bull faces, all in glinting gold. A cup in the shape of a Greek amphora has two centaurs dancing on it as handles. This is drunk history in which stiff classicism melts into “oriental” splendour. At last, we get a draught of intoxicating exuberance.

The 30-year-old actor topped the RadioTimes.com TV 100 power list, after rising to prominence for his role as Eric in the Netflix series Sex Education and being set to debut as the Doctor at the end of this year. Gatwa, who said the accolade was “bloody lovely”, beat the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who were ranked 15th, and Edwards, who placed as a runner-up after announcing the death of the Queen last year. Making up the top five are Heartstopper writer Alice Oseman in second place, White Lotus actor Jennifer Coolidge in fourth, and House of the Dragon breakout star Emma D’Arcy in fifth. Gatwa said: “Being recognised for anything is just bloody lovely, innit? Let alone being on the RadioTimes.com TV 100 list. TV is on fire at the moment, and so to top the list as well feels extra cool. “The titans that have topped the list before me, people such as Russell T Davies, Michaela Coel, Jodie Whittaker, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Olivia Colman, are all inspirations to me, and their work is something I aspire to. “They’re just really great storytellers above all else, and that’s all I could want to do.” Doctor Who screenwriter Davies, who topped the TV power list last year, said of Gatwa’s win: “Sometimes you know you’ve got a secret. And you hold it close to your chest and let it burn, because secrets are so delicious. “I’ve got that right now, because my secret is seeing Ncuti with Millie Gibson on the rushes of Doctor Who, every single day, and oh my God, this is so good. “I can promise you a completely new Doctor, and yet a Doctor utterly faithful to the 60 years that came before. Soon, the secret will be out, and we’ll all be dancing.” The annual Radio Times TV 100 power list celebrates the standout talents on screen and behind the scenes responsible for landmark moments in 2022. It is compiled by leading figures from across the creative industries, including the BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, who praised Gatwa’s “incredible dynamism” and boundless energy. Gatwa also beat The Traitors and Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman, and This Is Going to Hurt writer Adam Kay. England’s Lionesses appeared in eighth place on the list after their Euro 2022 final victory against Germany, which was “one of the most-watched TV spectacles of the year”, Radio Times said. Wildlife cameraman and CBeebies presenter Hamza Yassin, who won Strictly Come Dancing 2022, also made the list, alongside Heartstopper cast members Yasmin Finney, Kit Connor and Joe Locke. Morgan Jeffery, executive editor of RadioTimes.com, said: “I’m immensely proud of 2023’s list, which celebrates the brilliant diversity and vitality of television in all its forms and is led by a thoroughly deserving winner who is one of the industry’s very best and brightest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T18:28:32Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant will not harm the nature reserve next to it | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Minsmere in Suffolk is often described as the “jewel in the crown” of RSPB nature reserves.

Frodon, who won his most recent start in a handicap in the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton in November, is just 3lb higher on Saturday and will go to post with a serious chance, not least if Bryony Frost can get him into a rhythm in front. He could well be taken on in front, however, with both Annsam and Bobhopeornohope likely to vie for the lead, and Our Power (3.00), an eight-length third behind Cap Du Nord 12 months ago, is more appealing at around 7-1.

Newcastle 3.25 A typically competitive renewal of the Eider Chase, but Kitty’s Light has been eased a little in the weights having raced at around three miles so far this season, and could well return to the form that saw him finish a strong second in last year’s Scottish National – from an 11lb higher mark – now that he is back at a marathon trip.

He then switched to working on thermal power, exploring how to use energy more efficiently and to generate it in new ways. Walter was born in Bradford to Harry, who worked in textile manufacturing, and Martha (nee Strachan), a housewife. He was educated at Blackpool grammar school, after which the second world war interrupted his engineering studies at Cambridge University; he was sent to work on designing engines for fighter jets, first with Hawker Siddeley and then with Rolls-Royce. After the war Walter resumed his studies, staying on at Cambridge to research and design pumps for liquid metals, using electromagnetism rather than moving parts in contact with the dangerous and corrosive fluids. In austerity Britain he required great ingenuity to obtain the necessary materials and craftsmanship for his work. In 1954 he joined the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment as principal scientific officer, responsible for assessment of the various types of nuclear reactor then in development and tasked with working out what resources would be needed. Two years later he was appointed head of nuclear engineering at Queen Mary College in east London (now Queen Mary University of London) – the first such chair in Europe. While there he helped to build an experimental reactor in the Lea valley in London on what many years later was to become part of the 2012 Olympic park. When work began on the site, no trace was found of any radiation, making it one of the safest parts of the otherwise heavily polluted area. By 1968 he had become frustrated with the politics and vested interests of nuclear power generation, in particular the lack of progress on waste disposal, and decided to move away from the sector by becoming chair in thermal power at Imperial College London. There he foresaw the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, recognising the need to reduce demand for energy – whether by curtailing economic growth, or by using energy more efficiently. He remained at Imperial College until retirement in the early 1980s, and over that period was often called on (via the United Nations or British Council) to advise on energy matters abroad. He was also asked to provide expertise to the energy select committee of the House of Commons. Walter was a good judge of character, and always knew the right questions to ask. Music was hugely important to him, and he could also be great fun. His strong regard for truth and personal integrity gained him wide respect, though it did not always make life easy. He married Denise Schlumberger in 1952; she died in 2014, and their son Alan died in a car crash in 1980. Walter is survived by two other children, Linda and Francis, and three grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T06:14:32Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong hits back at China’s claim Aukus nuclear submarines will fuel an arms race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit back at China’s response to Aukus, insisting that its criticisms of the nuclear-powered submarine deal are “not grounded in fact”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions. After the announcement of a multi-decade plan that could cost as much as $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, Wong said no rational observer could conclude Australia was the source of a regional arms race. She urged China to take up a US offer to agree on “guardrails” to avoid an outbreak of war, despite the concept being derided by Beijing last week. Australia has previously accused China of lacking transparency about its own rapid military buildup. “Nobody wants to see escalation. Nobody wants to see a miscalculation,” Wong said on Tuesday. “I think the region is entitled to seek that the great powers manage competition respectfully and appropriately.” Hours after the Aukus plans were announced by the US, the UK and Australia on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry repeated its longstanding position that the deal reflected “a typical Cold War mentality” that would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN also denounced the “irony” that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. When asked about that comment, Wong said: “That response is not grounded in fact.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. She also said “a number of other countries have” nuclear-powered submarines – and they were allowed under the NPT. “Australia’s motivation is peace,” she said. Observers say the Aukus arrangement is novel, because it would be the first time that fissile material and nuclear technology had been transferred from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the Australian government is believed to disagree with this being characterised as a “loophole”, and it has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the program. Wong vowed to continue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in place “the highest quality arrangement … to ensure this material is managed in a way that is consistent with the NPT”. The UK and the US say they will provide Australia with nuclear material in “complete, welded nuclear power units that will not require refuelling” during the more than 30-year lifetime of the submarines. In a fact sheet issued on Tuesday, the Australian government added: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” The government has, however, promised to store the nuclear waste in Australia in a location yet to be decided. In recent weeks, Australian ministers and officials have paved the way for the Aukus announcement in a series of calls and meetings with counterparts across the Indo-Pacific. But ambassadors in Canberra are expected to be briefed in detail over the coming days. Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing on Monday to offer a briefing. Wong said the government had put in place “a comprehensive strategy” leading up to the announcement and made it a priority to re-engage with the Pacific and south-east Asia “in a very focused way”. The Aukus plan would give Australia “a greater capability of contributing to that strategic equilibrium which is necessary for the sort of region we all want to live in”. “Certainly it gives Australia a capability that very few countries have and that comes with responsibilities, which we are very aware of,” Wong said, adding that the plans would not undercut diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. “Our focus and our attention should be on averting conflict, on keeping the region stable, peaceful and prosperous, and ensuring that sovereignty can be protected.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the best way to reassure the region would be for Australia to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Indonesia – which joined with Malaysia to raise strong concerns about Aukus after it was first announced in 2021 – responded more cautiously on Tuesday. The Indonesian foreign ministry said it was the responsibility of all countries to maintain peace and stability in the region, and it expected Australia to develop “a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. On the eve of the announcement, China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper quoted Chinese analysts as claiming Australia was “planting a time bomb” and would bear the cost of its “expensive mistake”. But the incoming Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said last week Aukus should be seen in the context of China’s own push to build the world’s largest navy. China currently operates 56 submarines, of which 12 are nuclear-powered, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. Australia plans to buy at least three and as many as five Virginia-class submarines from the US in 2030s. The first Australian-built submarines, based on a yet-to-be-completed British design, should enter into service in the 2040s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T13:25:05Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant plans have not been scrapped, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","fields":{"bodyText":"Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Sizewell C, which would sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast if built, was expected to provide up to 7% of the UK’s electricity needs and plug a looming gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities. The BBC reported on Friday that the government had put the project under review and it could be delayed or even axed entirely. However, Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters: “Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations ongoing. I can’t get into detail of those, but negotiations have been constructive.” However, Grant Shapps, the business secretary, gave a firm indication that a pledge from Liz Truss, Sunak’s predecessor as prime minister, to eventually connect northern towns and cities from Hull to Liverpool through Bradford will at the very least be scaled back. “There wasn’t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines … It’s not true to say we’re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north,” he told the BBC. When complete, the reactor, which was estimated to cost £30bn, with taxpayers expected to foot about a fifth of that in partnership with private funding, was expected to generate electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. The BBC said a government official had told them: “We are reviewing every major project, including Sizewell C.” Plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a high-speed line across the north of England sometimes referred to unofficially as High Speed 3, are also under review. The review of major projects comes as Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, prepare to announce tax and spending plans on 17 November. The Sizewell C site is one of eight new nuclear reactors that the former prime minister Boris Johnson had planned to give the green light to over the next eight years. Last month Truss, who was then prime minister, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, pledged “full support” for Sizewell C, which is to be jointly developed by the French energy company EDF. Most UK nuclear power plants will be shut by 2030 – Sizewell B is due to close in 2035 – and the energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine has put the focus on national energy security solutions. While campaigning for the Conservative leadership in the summer, Sunak pledged to uphold Johnson’s plan to build eight new reactors. He also argued in favour of reforming licensing laws to allow the government to build more nuclear plants in an attempt to achieve energy independence by 2045. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “If the government turns its back on [Sizewell C], they will be breaking all of the promises they have made, and undermining our vital nuclear industry.” But Alison Downes of the Stop Sizewell C campaign said: “Sizewell C can only offer short-term pain – with more money on our energy bills – for long-term pain, with huge uncertainty about cost and time, to deliver electricity that is far more expensive than renewables. There is no way Sizewell C offers the hard-stretched public purse value for money.” The government said that some major infrastructure projects were forging ahead, such as the rail line HS2, with one nuclear project set to be approved. “HS2 is under way, within budget, and supporting 28,000 jobs,” a spokesperson for the Treasury said. “We are also seeking to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next few years and aim to speed up the delivery of about 100 major infrastructure projects across the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T18:33:26Z","webTitle":"US will soon need to deter two major nuclear powers for first time, White House says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","fields":{"bodyText":"Within a decade, the US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned, pointing to the Russian arsenal that is increasingly being brandished by Moscow and an expanding Chinese stockpile. The president’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. It warns that threat could grow as Russian forces continue to suffer defeats on the battlefield. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint says. Its publication was scheduled in the spring but was postponed because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has threatened to use “all means” to defend Russian territory, in which he included Crimea, annexed in 2014, and four Ukrainian regions he now claims. The NSS pledges US support for Ukrainian resistance would not be affected by such threats. “The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons,” the document says. In a foreword, Biden makes a distinction between the types of threats posed by Moscow and Beijing. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown,” the president writes. He describes China, on the other hand as “the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective”. The policy document portrays Beijing as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge”. “The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly,” it says. China has an estimated 350 nuclear warheads, according to an assessment by the Federation of American Scientists, compared with 5,977 in Russia’s stockpile, against the US inventory of 5,428. However, the Pentagon believes the Chinese force will grow to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030, making it a third major nuclear power. Under the last remaining major arms control agreement in place, the New Start treaty, the US and Russia observe a ceiling of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, referring to those warheads mounted on land or sea-launched missiles, or ready for loading on to long-range bombers. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, expressed concern over whether the new language in the strategy document could herald a rethink about the size of the US arsenal. “If we have to worry about two near-peer nuclear rivals by the year 2030, what does that mean for the number of targets in Russia and China that the president believes we need to hold at risk to deter those nuclear threats? And how does that affect that total number of strategic nuclear weapons the United States and the president believes he needs to deploy?” Kimball asked. “They’re basically looking at issues and questions that could lead to a larger number calculation,” he said, adding: “It’s not hard science. It could be more; it could be less. I would argue that even if China has twice the number of nuclear weapons, we still can and should reduce the total number of strategic nuclear weapons because what we have is excessive of any reasonable calculation of what it takes to deter a nuclear attack.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T15:06:59Z","webTitle":"Cheltenham Festival day three tips: Flooring Porter can power to hat-trick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","fields":{"bodyText":"Paisley Park and Flooring Porter, the winners from three of the last four seasons, are both in the field for the Stayers’ Hurdle at Cheltenham on Thursday and while the former would be a hugely popular winner, Gavin Cromwell’s eight-year-old looks the better bet at around 6-1 to complete a hat-trick in the day’s feature event. Flooring Porter (3.30) has failed to score in three starts since his two-and-three-quarter length success 12 months ago, but he was winless in three before that victory too and should perhaps have set a stronger clip when only fourth behind Home By The Lee, another of Thursday’s rivals, at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting. Danny Mullins knows exactly what is required around three miles at Cheltenham, however, and while the six-year-old Teahupoo is a live contender for the next generation of stayers, his best form is on heavy ground and he was a disappointment on his only previous start at the Festival. Cheltenham 1.30 The latest big banker for the Irish and Mighty Potter’s form is very difficult to fault. He was sent straight into Grade One company after winning a beginners’ race in November and has scored decisively in two top-level races since, including a defeat of Gaillard Du Mesnil, Tuesday’s National Hunt Chase winner, at Fairyhouse in December. His latest victory at the Dublin Racing Festival was backed up by a strong time and Gordon Elliott’s six-year-old surely has better still to come. Cheltenham 2.10 The qualifier for this race at Haydock in February was run in a strong time on similar ground, and the runner-up, The Changing Man, lines up for the Final off just a 2lb higher mark. He is more exposed than some of his rivals but also admirably consistent, having finished first or second in his last six starts, and is a very tempting each-way option at around 20-1. Cheltenham 2.50 The aura of invincibility that surrounded Shishkin in the first three seasons of his career vanished in last year’s Champion Chase, but he returned to something close to peak form when stepped up in trip at Ascot last month. At his best, he is the better part of a stone clear on ratings and a repeat of his latest performance should be more than enough. Cheltenham 4.10 It goes against the grain to back a short-priced favourite in a 24-runner Festival handicap, but Emmet Mullins, the trainer of So Scottish, took this race with a similar type in The Shunter two years ago and his claims are impossible to ignore. The six-year-old made short work of his first two starts over fences before finishing second at Ascot on his handicap debut over an inadequate trip and should improve significantly for the return to two-and-a-half miles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-16T14:59:28Z","webTitle":"‘We love life – but death loves us more’: the pain and power of Iraqi music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","fields":{"bodyText":"‘I heard an American Humvee approaching as soldiers were patrolling our area in Al-Qa’im, close to the Syrian border.” The Iraqi music producer UsFoxx is recalling a childhood memory, from 2004, during the Iraq war. “Through the open windows I heard this infectious beat, which I later learned was 50 Cent’s In Da Club. My jaw dropped.” This unexpected but inspiring encounter was the first step of UsFoxx’s journey to becoming one of the many prolific producers and beatmakers in Baghdad today. The position of music in Iraqi culture was badly distorted after the 2003 American-led invasion which silenced many voices or stunted their evolution, but 20 years later a new generation of eclectic artists has emerged – particularly in the aftermath of the political upheaval of the 2019-21 Tishreen uprising protests – with work spanning rap, techno, experimental music, jazz and beyond. Speaking from a newly setup studio in Baghdad, UsFoxx is eager to share his music with me, “from house to Afrobeats; old school to new school trap”. Having moved from Iraq to India after Islamic State attacks in 2015, then weathered Covid lockdowns in 2020 in Iraq after he had returned, music was an outlet for his adventurous ear. Like many of his contemporaries, UsFoxx is self-taught in music production, and the internet and satellite dishes allowed after a ban under the Saddam Hussein regime meant that his generation could absorb new influences and create new aesthetics. He made the beat for 2022’s Iraq Cypher which brought together sharp and witty socio-cultural lyricism from nine stellar Iraqi rappers – Kira The Blurryface, Armando Rap, Nayomi, Disser, KC Hamada, AlRong, Genesis, Odd Khalid and El Seen – over a drill-adjacent beat, and London-based Saudi DJ Nooriyah has played UsFoxx’s tracks in her hugely popular Boiler Room set last December. But he’s still melancholy amid the success: “Iraqi people have suffered so much untreated trauma – we Iraqis survive, we love life, although death loves us more,” UsFoxx says with a sigh. Over in Basra, beatmaker Hafs is a similarly melancholic figure, with a sound fluttering between ambient pop, Afrobeats and trip-hop – his fragility and depth of emotion in contrast to the prevailing hypermasculinity in the war-torn country. He explains his motivation: “When I became depressed it was because of things that happened to me in the past, and our present is rooted in the past. So I became more aware that when I make music, I can channel my feelings to the listeners: my music can make them feel the sadness or happiness that I feel.” Hafs started his career almost 10 years ago in rap battles on online forums, and refined his creativity into his hybrid sound, coupled with a philosophical and sentimental approach. “When someone hurts me, I don’t reply immediately – I relax and leave it, then make music and write about that pain,” he says with a wry smile. His single Kawabis (meaning nightmares in Arabic) was drawn from a harrowing moment – “I had a nightmare about having a nightmare. I could not touch myself and had so much pain from life” – and incorporates sounds and beats found on the internet, “softening the harshness” of the maazoufeh rhythm. In Basra there are no venues to perform in, due to the conservative nature of society, so the only places in which to perform non-classical styles of music are public parks. So Hafs has released a large number of albums via YouTube, the chief medium for releasing music in Iraq. More recently he has put out work on the indie record label Shlonak Records, founded by Canada-based Iraqi rapper and professor Narcy, who established it to aid releases in a country where Spotify only arrived in 2021 and the physical production of music relies on piracy. Producer Abdulisms, a principal voice on the Iraqi music scene in London and another vital part of Shlonak Records, explains the logistical barriers in Iraq: “Most tracks are distributed on Telegram channels; there’s often no way of getting MP3s apart from ripping them off YouTube.” The other issue is that PayPal is not available there. But Covid lockdowns deepened the ties between musicians in Iraq and around the world. Unable to collaborate with people in London, Abdulisms joined Iraq-A-Fella Radio, a show started by Mocity, a Delhi-based Iraqi label owner and DJ, exploring many branches of sonic heritage, “from chobi to chalghi, to more nostalgic tunes, presenting Iraqi female singers, rappers and football anthems,” Abdulisms says. UsFoxx was also involved, “feeding us all the tracks and information from Iraq. Iraq-A-Fella started as heart surgery” – something to heal its wounded listeners – “and took on a life of its own. It was mad!” Meanwhile, London-based British-Iraqi artist manager Nazar Risafi has been working with Iraqi duo Tribe of Monsters, who are based in Amman, Jordan. Their trailblazing single Cypher took the voice of legendary Iraqi singer Sajda Obeid and blended it with Cardi B and Gucci Mane, spiced up with a trip-hop groove and Iraqi percussion and interwoven with samples of Arabic instruments such as the oud and nay. Risafi explains that the Tishreen uprising, which lasted almost two years and saw a mass movement of Iraqi youth take to the streets demanding a new homeland and Iraqi identity beyond sectarianism, had a huge effect. “We started seeing rap artists online and on the streets, rapping about the revolution,” he says. “From there people started to connect – in 2020 you saw collaborations between artists in Iraq with artists outside Iraq.” Rapping about state corruption as well as the insidious effects of sectarianism, economic downturn, unemployment and international interference in Iraq, the music is both anti-establishment and anti-interventionist. The first Tribe of Monsters single Dheil A’waj (Crooked Tail) meticulously described the daily struggles young people faced on the streets during the uprising, followed by Albo October, which referenced the protests where more than 700 protesters were killed and more than 17,000 injured. “October boys, we salute you, the Iraqi flag flies high above us and all the corrupt politicians are beneath our feet,” Ameer Shamy raps. The duo has been preparing a compilation album titled Made in Iraq, bringing together the cream of the Iraqi rap scene. There are female rappers too – at least in the diaspora – such as Nayomi or Psi.ko, but Iraqi music is not all about electronic music and rap. In the US, Iraqi-American jazz trumpeter and musician Amir ElSaffar has been touring with the Two Rivers Ensemble; a sextet of international and south west Asian musicians making innovative strides between American jazz and the maqam modal system which ElSaffar explains is “a repertoire of melodies that are sung to poetry and practised in Iraq for hundreds of years, going back to the Abbasid era [750 to AD1258]”. For him, playing this specifically Iraqi music is a political gesture, reminding listeners of how the country endures. “I’m glad that some people are remembering and acknowledging the horrors, but it seems like [most of] the world has moved on,” he says. “We still need to think about the impact on ordinary Iraqis.” He has just returned from a visit to Iraq for the first time in 20 years, and was wowed by a 40-strong ensemble of musicians all under the age of 35. “I was getting tears in my eyes, because they were playing from memory and putting their hearts into it in a very intimate way.” Nadin Al Khalidi is an Iraqi multi-instrumentalist and singer for the Sweden based group Tarabband who plays another style altogether: veering between the ecstatic Arab urban music of tarab and western folk and classical arrangements, Al Khalidi adds a touch of Iraqi chobi (an upbeat folkloric rhythm local to Iraq), jazz and north African rhythms. Growing up in an artistic household, with weekly visits to the Baghdad Opera House, she recalls sirens and bombs soundtracking her childhood during the Gulf war. After that, she says, “there were the sanctions on Iraq; there was the dictatorship and constant spying, and then the invasion.” The Iraq war in 2001 forced Al Khalidi and her sister to flee as refugees – she speaks to me from her home office in Malmö. She had been taught to play the violin at The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad as a child, but had to abandon her musical education due to the wars. Upon arriving in Sweden Al Khalidi worked in a pub, where the Serbian owner encouraged her to sing in Arabic. “I had no responsibilities; my parents had died and I was eager to live. I dreamed of playing the guitar and there I was, playing the music that I loved for the first time, with a PA system and a mic.” Within a week, the Malmö Symphony Orchestra asked her to take part in a project sharing Arabic folk music, where she met her eventual Tarabband collaborator Gabriel Hermanson. For the 2022 album Yekhaf (I Intimidate Him) she worked with an Egyptian poet, Hazem Wefy, “who helped me understand how I’m writing from personal experiences. The album is about encounters with fellow Iraqis, Arabic-speakers and kindred spirits, the young generation of Iraqis demonstrating on the streets,” and about “new friendships and support systems created en route.” One of the most touching songs is Sedra, dedicated to a refugee girl from Mosul who Al Khalidi met during a performance in 2018. “She kept interrupting me as I was singing in Arabic. Later she told me that she saw the execution of both her parents by IS. She asked me to sing about her – and this song is for her.” Farther south in Europe, the experimental, innovative work of Khyam Allami, a Berlin-based British-Iraqi multi-instrumentalist, researcher and founder of the label Nawa Recordings, draws from the past to look into the future. Allami studied oud in London and engaged with Iraqi maqam which are the basis for his debut album, Resonance/Dissonance, “but I always wanted to understand what makes an Iraqi song and what’s the thumbprint carried within,” he says. “We can forge new ideas and a new future by learning from the past, but that doesn’t necessarily mean reviving the past or taking it literally. What I’ve been trying to get at is the essence of something.” He says he’s been inspired by African American artists, who, “whether it’s hip-hop, jazz, or other artistic and musical forms, have had to define their own future based on their past, in a way that’s owned and committed.” Allami is now delving into 9th and 10th century Arabic manuscripts by Iraqi polymaths Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, and how they relate to today’s culture. The deep desire for Iraqis such as UsFoxx and Hafs to connect with the outside world is met, then, with a similar desire from the Iraqi diaspora to connect with their homeland – which needs to be handled sensitively. Allami collaborated with the National Youth Orchestra of Iraq a few years ago – “It was the first time that I’d been able to connect with this generation who had lived through these catastrophes” – and while studying in Cairo, met a young man “whose entire family was killed in an air raid; that generation has a look in their eye that tells us that we haven’t lived what they’ve lived through. But I’ve learned that we need to think about our contributions regardless of our positions.” What he contributes, he says, is “allowing others to do a different kind of work”. ElSaffar also often thinks about how he can “connect the jazz improv scene to that in Iraq”, and for Al Khalidi it is a similar story: “I would love to perform in Iraq with Tarabband, but I would come back home to Sweden”. Every Iraqi has a story of why they had to leave, Abdulisms explains: “The question of returning is far too complex and intersects with a lot of power [structures].” Despite the challenges, Iraqi musicians are asserting the longstanding plurality of their country’s identity and adding to the remarkably eclectic fabric of its music. It seems that even the Iraqi government is catching up: prime minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani recently gave the green light for works to resume on Baghdad’s Opera House. One of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world can once again become a space nurturing culture and creativity – qualities that are clearly in abundant supply in Iraq."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/07/rishi-sunak-white-house-summit-brexit-britain-washington-europe-joe-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-07T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s White House jolly can’t mask the fact that Brexit Britain is a fading power | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/rishi-sunak-white-house-summit-brexit-britain-washington-europe-joe-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/rishi-sunak-white-house-summit-brexit-britain-washington-europe-joe-biden","fields":{"bodyText":"The Americans know how to make a prime minister feel special. It isn’t hard. Saying “you are special” or words to that effect, usually does the trick. It helps to say it in the White House, within earshot of the British press corps. Westminster hacks and Downing Street aides, most of whom are unhealthily obsessed with US politics, love a Washington summit for the same reason that Harry Potter fans queue to visit the Warner Bros studio in Watford. Standing on the stage where the magic happens is its own reward. That makes Rishi Sunak a cheap date for Joe Biden at this week’s summit. The US president can bestow the normal diplomatic courtesies, while conceding nothing of strategic substance. Downing Street then tells friendly journalists that the two men bonded over baseball, or some other shared cultural enthusiasm, or that their wives did. The prime minister flies home with burnished credentials as the leader of a very important country indeed. The bar for summit success has been set low. It helps that the prime minister isn’t Boris Johnson or Liz Truss, whose bellicose Brexit methods sabotaged transatlantic relations. By negotiating the Windsor framework, easing frictions around Northern Ireland, Sunak atoned for the offence that Biden summarised crudely, but fairly, as “screwing around” with the Good Friday agreement. Sunak’s mission to Washington is also mercifully free of unrealistic speculation about a US-UK free-trade deal. This was an obsession for Brexit enthusiasts. Opening new vistas of transatlantic commerce was meant to outweigh any downside to withdrawal from the European single market. The economics of that proposition never added up, but it was a comfort to Eurosceptics, whose paranoia about London’s submission to Brussels fed a delusion of parity with Washington. Donald Trump nurtured that fantasy. His successor has kiboshed it. Biden’s economic strategy is based around lavish government support for domestic industries, tax breaks for investment and supply chains rerouted to assert US strategic primacy. That buries the model of globalisation that Brexit ideologues had in mind when mapping their buccaneering adventures on the high seas of international trade. Sunak is a disciple of the small-state, anti-intervention school of conservatism. He finds Bidenomics perplexing for that reason alone. But it also highlights the terrible error of quitting the continental bloc in which Britain, by pooling resources with European partners, had a chance of keeping pace with the Americans. If economic competition in the years ahead is going to be an arms race of industrial subsidy, the UK will be outgunned by Brussels and Washington. The counterclaim by keepers of the Brexit faith is that Britain’s isolation is really an advantage, permitting agility and innovation where Europe is staid and sclerotic. A nimbly sovereign nation might lead the way in new sectors. Hence Downing Street has hyped Sunak’s interest in AI ahead of the Washington trip. The prime minister has been consulting tech bosses about awesome new computing powers coming on stream. He has been pondering how best to manage the development of machines that might, within years, rival nuclear weapons in their capacity to cause harm in the wrong hands. He has concluded that Britain can lead the world in this field, and that London should be the capital of global AI governance. He will raise all of this with President Biden, we are told. The idea of an international AI regulator – equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna – is perfectly sensible. London could make a respectable bid to host it. But so could other cities. Either way, it won’t be decided over coffee on Wednesday night. Visiting leaders “raise” all sorts of things with their hosts. It is a diplomatic euphemism for questions brought to the table with no expectation of answers. Things are “raised” for the benefit of an audience back home, so the leader who doesn’t really set the agenda can claim to have put some item on it. Under a friendly (or credulous) media lens, the prime minister is thus projected from the margins of international influence into the centre. Something similar happened last week, when Sunak attended a summit of the European Political Community (EPC) in Moldova. The EPC was first convened last year by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is envisaged as a forum where EU and non-EU heads of government can discuss pan-continental issues. That is no substitute for the seat (and the veto) that Britain used to have at European Council summits, but it is better than nothing. Ukraine was the focus of discussions in Moldova. Except, that is, when Sunak raised the topic of illegal migration. His unilateral digression was then spun by Downing Street as Britain “taking the lead” on a vital issue; putting it “at the top of the international agenda”. This fiction was transmitted by various UK media outlets, as if all of Europe’s leaders huddled round their British counterpart while he laid down the law on small boats crossing the Channel. Preposterously, GB News even reported it as a “migration meeting”. At least Sunak was invited to Moldova. There had been no British representation the previous week at a meeting in Sweden of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. This, too, is a relatively new institution. It was launched in June 2021 by Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, to coordinate policy on “global trade and technology” between Washington and Brussels. The most recent gathering discussed a code of conduct for AI development. That is exactly the conversation Sunak thinks should be happening in London. But if Americans and Europeans are already having it somewhere else, why should they move it? What does Britain offer for just a seat in the room? To raise the question is not to deny that a UK prime minister has clout. There is heft in the office of the leader of a G7 economy, with a nuclear arsenal and a permanent seat on the UN security council. Biden makes time for Sunak because the relationship between the two countries is important. When it comes to defence and security cooperation, it is one of the sturdiest alliances in the world. But friendship is not the same as influence. It is a bald strategic fact that Brexit makes a British prime minister less useful to Washington. Without leverage in Brussels, Sunak is not in a position to broker deals with Biden. Instead, he pays tribute. That can be spun into something special for the parochial Westminster audience that doesn’t want to admit that Britain is smaller outside the EU. The message will get through eventually. There are only so many angles for making the margins look like the centre. There is only so long Britain can fake being a global power if it isn’t a player in Europe.

The PP had snatched no fewer than six regions and some of Spain’s biggest cities from the socialists’ grasp, much to the delight of the supporters who had descended, flag-waving and jubilant, on the conservatives’ HQ on Génova Street in central Madrid. Despite the boisterous cheering from outside, however, one person who had arrived at Génova three hours earlier was not punching the air, roaring in triumph or demanding high-fives from underlings. Then again, few who know Alberto Núñez Feijóo would expect such emotional incontinence from the man who assumed the PP leadership just over a year ago. “He’s a very restrained person when it comes to his personal reactions,” says a veteran adviser who was with Feijóo on Sunday night. “He doesn’t let himself get down when things don’t go well and he isn’t exultant when things go the way he wants them to. I’ve been with him through a lot of triumphs and I’ve never seen him go over the top about them.” Feijóo’s inner circle believes it is precisely those qualities of equanimity and moderation that have helped the 61-year-old reconfigure the PP after a turbulent few years and made him the favourite to win the snap general election announced by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, hours after his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) was humbled at the polls. Unlike his erratic, avowedly rightwing predecessor, Pablo Casado, who dragged the PP away from the centre ground in an unsuccessful effort to stop its voters being seduced by the far-right Vox party, Feijóo is a fixture of the more progressive wing of the centre-right. So much so, in fact, that he has even admitted voting for the PSOE’s Felipe González in the 1982 election that marked the end of Spain’s post-Franco transition to democracy. Much has been made of his calm, understated demeanour – especially in contrast to the slick, telegenic and sometimes unpredictable charms of Sánchez. Feijóo’s camp readily acknowledges that he is a reflective individual who could be viewed as very much a product of his home region of Galicia, of which he was president between 2009 and last year. According to the ancient but enduring cliche, Galicians are very, very difficult to read. The seasoned adviser – who mentions the old joke about how hard it can be to determine whether a Galician is going up the stairs or coming down them – argues Feijóo is too thoughtful to fit naturally into a world of Twitter, soundbites and gotchas. “He’s not comfortable with that … and he doesn’t think politics is a tweet,” they note, approvingly. And yet his team also likes to position Feijóo as something of a modern outlier within his own very traditional, affluent party: a man from very humble beginnings who helped his grandparents in their small shop, worked to support his family when his father lost his job, and who became a father himself at the age of 55 after meeting a woman who already had a child from a previous relationship. Despite his low-key image, Feijóo has not always managed to avoid scandal. The publication 10 years ago of photographs showing him on holiday in the mid-1990s with a friend who was later convicted of drug trafficking led to calls for him to step down as Galicia’s president. But he survived the affair, insisting he had had no reason to suspect his friend, Marcial Dorado, was involved in anything illegal, and claiming he had broken off contact with Dorado as soon as he was charged with criminal offences. A decade on, the epithet most readily associated with Feijóo is “safe pair of hands” – a description that was also sometimes applied to Mariano Rajoy, a fellow Galician who was PP prime minister between 2011 and 2018, when Sánchez used a vote of no confidence to turf his corruption-mired administration out of office. “Feijóo’s advantage is that he’s a steady pair of hands,” says Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political consultancy Teneo. “That’s what he is and that’s what he was in Galicia. He’s been able to unite the party and post a very good result in the elections – and power is a very good glue for political parties.” Unlike Casado, he adds, Feijóo is not a polarising figure within his own party, nor for the electorate. “He can definitely appeal to centre-right voters, but even some people who have gone to Vox might be attracted to support Feijóo.” The problem is that the far-right party appears to hold Feijóo’s future in its hands. Strong as the PP’s showing was last Sunday, no poll shows the party winning anything like enough seats in July to be able to govern on its own. The PP will also need to rely on deals with Vox to help it govern many of the regions it has just won. But any PP-Vox regional coalition governments would come at a cost as they would serve to confirm Sánchez’s argument that the conservatives are happy to ally themselves with the far right for the sake of power. The prime minister is hoping the spectre of Vox in government will help mobilise leftwing and centrist voters on a massive scale. This week, he said Spain was not immune to the political trends that swept Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro to power. He said Spaniards would have to decide whether they want a prime minister “on the side of Biden or of Trump, on the side of Lula or of Bolsonaro”. While Feijóo has refused to explicitly rule out any deals with Vox come 23 July, his team is adamant that the newly centre-right PP will not be swayed by their competitors on the far right, stressing the conservatives will continue to defend equality policies, guarantee Spain’s system of autonomous regional government, and maintain the country’s fiercely pro-European outlook. The coming weeks will reveal whether Feijóo is the moderate he claims to be – or whether he is a more pragmatic and opportunistic political animal. For the currently bullish PP, however, he is very much the right leader at the right time. “He’s a tried-and-tested product,” says the adviser. “For good or for ill, we all know what Feijóo’s like.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-08T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"US warns Australia against joining treaty banning nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"bodyText":"The US has warned Australia against joining a landmark treaty banning nuclear weapons, saying the agreement could hamper defence arrangements between the US and its allies. But New Zealand said it was “pleased to observe a positive shift” in Australia’s position in a United Nations vote and “would, of course, welcome any new ratifications as an important step to achieving a nuclear weapon-free world”. The comments follow the Albanese government shifting Australia’s voting position on the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to “abstain” after five years of blanket opposition by the Coalition government. The relatively new treaty imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. But so far it has been shunned by all of the nuclear weapons states and many of their allies. The US embassy in Canberra said the treaty “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That is a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. The embassy said the treaty also risked “reinforcing divisions” within the international community. “While the United States understands and shares the desire to advance nuclear disarmament goals, we do not support the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons,” a spokesperson for the US embassy told Guardian Australia. “The United States does not believe that progress toward nuclear disarmament can be decoupled from the prevailing security threats in today’s world.” The comments are a sign of the pushback Australia faces from its top security ally if it gets closer to signing and ratifying the treaty – although that still seems distant. New Zealand said it welcomed “constructive developments in Australia’s approach” to the treaty, including the shift from opposing a NZ-backed resolution on the topic at the UN general assembly first committee last month. New Zealand’s minister for disarmament and arms control, Phil Twyford, has met with Australian representatives. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said New Zealand continued to urge all countries that were not yet a party to the treaty to sign and ratify it “at the earliest opportunity”, while acknowledging it was “for Australia to determine its position”. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been involved in advocacy against nuclear weapons and has described them as “the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created”. Albanese moved the motion at Labor’s 2018 national conference backing the TPNW, saying the task would not be easy or simple but it would be “just”. The treaty now has 91 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it entered into force last year. Labor’s 2021 national platform committed the party to signing and ratifying the treaty “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. These conditions suggest the barriers to actually joining the treaty may still be high. But campaigners have welcomed Albanese’s comments over the weekend that characterised the very existence of nuclear weapons as a security threat, rather than espousing deterrence. The prime minister told the Australian newspaper that the threat by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to use tactical nuclear weapons “has reminded the world that the existence of nuclear weapons is a threat to global security and the norms we had come to take for granted”. Gem Romuld, the Australia director of the Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said that framing was notable. “In contrast to the previous government, prime minister Albanese clearly understands that nuclear weapons undermine global security, and that pursuing disarmament is of paramount importance,” Romuld said. “It’s no surprise the US doesn’t want Australia to join the ban treaty but it will have to respect our right to take a humanitarian stance against these weapons.” Romuld raised concerns that the plans for hosting of US B-52 aircraft in Australia “could escalate regional tensions or involve nuclear weapons, which Australia has committed not to ‘station’ under the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone”. Indonesia’s ambassador, Siswo Pramono, said Australia’s positive shift on the treaty would “give encouragement to others to believe that we are on the right path” in seeking a world free of nuclear weapons. Australia continues to pursue closer security and defence cooperation with the US, including plans to acquire nuclear-powered but conventionally armed submarines under the Aukus agreement, which also includes the UK. The defence minister, Richard Marles, told the Submarine Institute conference in Canberra on Tuesday that Australia must “make sure that we are able to be good nuclear stewards from cradle to grave” to secure international acceptance of Aukus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T15:32:00Z","webTitle":"Pentagon spokesperson tamps down concerns over nuclear ‘Armageddon’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","fields":{"bodyText":"The US military’s top spokesperson tamped down concerns of an imminent nuclear threat from Russia, days after Joe Biden warned of a potential nuclear “Armageddon”. Speaking at a Democratic fundraiser this week, Biden talked bluntly about the threat of a nuclear attack from Russia. “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,” the president said. He added that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, was “not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming” after invading Ukraine earlier this year. Echoing comments from the White House earlier this week, the top Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said Biden’s comments were not based on specific new information. “His comments were not based on new or fresh intelligence or new indications that Mr Putin has made a decision to use nuclear weapons,” Kirby told Martha Raddatz in an interview on ABC News’ This Week. “Quite frankly, we don’t have any information that he has made that kind of decision. Nor have we seen anything that would give us pause to reconsider our own strategic nuclear posture.” Biden’s remarks invoking Armageddon drew a sharp rebuke from the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a member of the Donald Trump White House’s cabinet who is mulling a 2024 presidential run. “Those comments were reckless” and “a terrible risk to the American people”, Pompeo said on the Republican-friendly Fox News network. Kirby on Sunday also declined to weigh on a recent explosion on the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and Crimea, the Ukrainian territory under Russian control. The explosion dealt a blow to Russian military logistics and embarrassed Putin, for whom the bridge had symbolic personal importance. Ukraine has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has been celebrated by senior leaders in the country. “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge,” Kirby said. “I just don’t have anything more to contribute to that this morning.” Kirby also addressed Biden’s comments last week that the US was trying to find where Putin could get an “off ramp” to the war on Ukraine. “Mr Putin started this war and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country,” Kirby said. “He’s the one who chose to start this conflict again and he can choose to end it.” Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. But Ukraine’s defenders in recent weeks have taken back some of the territories it had lost control of during the invasion. With its hold on Ukraine weakening, Putin recently ordered the mobilization of reservists to reinforce the invasion, which ignited protests in dozens of cities across Russia and has led to long lines at its land borders with other countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 270 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) boss, Rafael Grossi, said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But he said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom had earlier accused Ukraine of shelling at the plant, which is under Russian occupation. Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but it was “very unlikely” that the clips showed what Russia claims. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday said 47 places had been identified where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainians. They include places in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Rishi Sunak made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Saturday to meet Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – Sunak’s first visit to the country since taking office. Sunak announced that Britain would provide a £50m air defence package for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Zelenskiy thanked Sunak, for his support and tweeted: “With friends like you by our side, we are confident in our victory. Both of our nations know what it means to stand up for freedom.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Five people were injured in a Russian strike on a humanitarian station in southern Ukraine, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Zelenskiy. Nine people, including four children, died in a suspected gas explosion in a residential building in Russia’s Sakhalin island, the local governor said. About 60 Russian soldiers were killed in a long-range Ukrainian artillery attack this week, Kyiv said on Saturday. In a Facebook post, the armed forces general staff said Russia sustained the losses on Thursday when Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Mykhailkva, 40km to the south of Kherson. Russian forces abandoned the city earlier this month. Kyiv is in a “critical situation” with power shortages and faces hours-long blackouts, officials say, amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. But the energy ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian electricity supplies were under control and there was no need to panic. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the supply problems were worst in and around Kyiv as well as in six other regions. “We are working throughout the country to stabilise the situation,” he said in a video address. Ukrainian forces could be in Crimea by the end of December, the country’s deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has said. The UK Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update on the war Ukraine. Russia made its largest single-day issuance of debt in history on Wednesday, it said. The first passenger train to the recently liberated Kherson city arrived from Kyiv for the first time since Russian troops occupied the southern Ukrainian city. The funeral took place on Saturday of a Polish man who was one of two people killed when a missile crashed into a grain storage facility in the Polish village of Przewodow. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said China and Russia were seeking a world where force is used to resolve disputes, and he vowed that the United States would continue to defend humanitarian principles and international law. Asia-Pacific leaders added their voices on Saturday to international pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, issuing a summit statement saying “most” of them condemned the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T14:00:23Z","webTitle":"The Power of Trees by Peter Wohlleben review – let’s turn over a new leaf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","fields":{"bodyText":"Next time you’re walking through a park on a hot day, take a moment to sit under a big old tree. While you’re reclining under the shady boughs, you’ll find that the temperature is something like 2C cooler than if you were beneath a parasol. Why? Because a mature deciduous tree releases a massive amount of water from its leaves, which cools the surrounding air as it evaporates, just like the way sweating cools our bodies down. So a single tree influences the microclimate around it – but what about an entire forest? That’s the question explored in The Power of Trees by German forester Peter Wohlleben, whose 2015 book The Hidden Life of Trees was a surprise international bestseller. By way of an answer, Wohlleben whisks us to Berlin, where the average noon temperature in summer over a 15-year period was a stifling 33C. But travel a little further, to the bosky woods around the German capital, and the temperature drops sharply. This is because, we’re told, “beeches and oaks act like bodies of water”. The trees “cool the landscape so much that the temperature difference between a city like Berlin and an ancient woodland is about 15C.” Interestingly, homogenous pine plantations – of the kind being planted as “carbon sinks” – end up being 8C warmer on average than deciduous woodlands. As Wohllenben tartly observes: “The results make it clear that these dismal monocultures can never replace real forests.” But as the book explains, ancient glades don’t just cool the air around them; they also play an outsize role in our planet’s water cycle. A single beech tree can breathe out 500 litres of water a day, which creates a local low-pressure area that air is drawn into. “Forests suck fresh air from the oceans – and they do this over great distances,” writes Wohlleben. This damp oceanic air rises above forests, cools down, and then rains its moisture down on the trees. This means that chopping down forests has a profound – but sadly not widely recognised – impact on global rainfall. “If forests are cut down and replaced with, say, grass or croplands, rainfall could decrease by 90%,” the author writes, bluntly. This isn’t idle speculation. Droughts have been increasing in the Amazon as the coastal rainforest has been heartbreakingly logged and razed. Wohlleben writes in a sober style, but he can’t hide his anger with the way people today – including many environmentalists – now “think of trees as little more than biological storage units for carbon dioxide either while they are alive or, better yet, when they are dead”. This hellishly narrow perspective ignores the vast beneficial effects that forests – especially ancient forests – generate for global temperature management. Although the main thrust of the book is about the interplay between forests and the climate emergency, there are some fascinating detours along the way. I never knew, for example, that some trees can identify which little seedlings growing around them are their own offspring, and use their roots to feed their “kids” with a sugary solution. And I couldn’t help but be enthralled by the account of the ways trees learn from drought and other environmental shocks, and then behave very differently to trees that haven’t been through the same stresses. This book is wise and thought-provoking, even if at times the prose is as wooden as a lumberjack’s CV. Wohlleben reveals how we’re in the grip of an egomaniacal conceit that humans are somehow smarter than nature. As a result, too many politicians think the best approach to the environmental crisis is even more micromanagement and human control. A better idea would be to trust nature, giving the Earth’s complex ecosystems the space and time they need to heal. As the author drily concludes: “In view of the challenges we now face with climate change, more humility would be a fine thing.” The Power of Trees by Peter Wohlleben (translated by Jane Billinghurst) is published by Greystone (£18.99).

She has also run twice – unsuccessfully – for state governor. For her next move, she’s not focusing on electoral power so much as power itself. Recently she left the world of campaign politics and took a job as senior counsel for the non-profit Rewiring America. Her role will focus on helping thousands of people across America wean their homes and businesses off fossil fuels and on to electricity, at a moment when scientists have given a “final warning” about the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global catastrophe. “We are at an inflection point where we can choose to electrify,” she said in an interview. “We don’t have to do it everywhere, all at once. If you want to see what the future looks like, we start building it here and now.” The impetus for her role comes from significant moves taken by the Biden administration. When he signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last year, President Joe Biden hailed it as “the biggest step forward on climate ever”. It includes a sprawling array of tax credits, rebates and other incentives to help people electrify their lives. “The government has basically filled a bank account for you with thousands of dollars that will help you go electric,” Abrams said. Her mission is to help people access that so-called bank account. “You can improve your indoor air quality, make cooking quick and easy, make being cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and be more affordable,” Abrams said. “But we have to talk about it.” Abrams is perhaps best known for registering 800,000 voters in Georgia through her voting rights advocacy organization Fair Fight Action. She wants to use a similar playbook with electrification, and doing so could benefit many of the same people whose voices risked going unheard in elections. Low-income communities and communities of color have long had to contend with polluting, inefficient appliances. This has an impact on public health by increasing the risk of asthma and leads to higher utility bills that take a bigger bite out of households’ income. The IRA takes aim at some of those wrongs, with tax credits and rebates that can help those households swap in heat pumps, induction stoves and electric vehicles for their gas-powered counterparts. But figuring out what incentives you qualify for and how to access them can be involved, to say the least. While Rewiring America has a calculator that lets individuals suss out what IRA benefits they can snag, Abrams will be taking that and other tools to the community level. She highlighted how houses of worship could be prime places to talk about the IRA and a potential target for outreach. And she hopes to work with local leaders such as teachers, mayors and city council members to make the IRA a kitchen table issue. Enlisting them will, she hopes, eventually lead to neighbors talking to neighbors about how much money they saved on a new induction stove or how much more comfortable their home was during a heatwave thanks to a newly installed heat pump. “You meet people where they are, not where you want them to be,” she said. “That means understanding the lives they’re living and the questions they have and who they go to to talk about their questions.” While the IRA has the potential to be transformative, it’s also not enough to electrify every household in the country. The law has billions set aside for home upgrades, but more resources will be needed to achieve the Biden administration’s goal of reducing US emissions up to 52% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. An analysis by the Rhodium Group found the law has the potential to cut emissions by up to 42%. And that it could reduce home energy bills by $717 to $1,146 by 2030. Abrams said that, based on her experience in the arena of voting rights, the prospect of such benefits could help foster an electrification movement. “As people get more, they expect more,” she said. “The most sustainable movement is when people expect more and are willing to work for more.” This isn’t Abrams’ first foray into climate. She was quick to point out her college senior thesis was on environmental justice and that she interned with the Environmental Protection Agency. During her tenure in the Georgia house of representatives, she also worked as minority leader to help pass a bill that included the state’s biggest influx of cash for public transportation. Ultimately, the Biden administration wants the US to reach net zero by mid-century. It might be hard to imagine that occurring – a distant future, when perhaps technologies that are only nascent today like carbon dioxide removal will be more widespread, almost every car and home will be electric, and the inequalities targeted by the IRA and Biden’s executive orders will have dwindled. That scenario can read a bit like science fiction – a genre of which Abrams is a well-known fan. “In almost every sci-fi story, it begins with what decisions people are making long before the story takes place,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T09:21:39Z","webTitle":"Opposition leader makes fresh nuclear pitch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","fields":{"bodyText":"With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Enjoy your night, we’ll be back first thing tomorrow for all the latest. Here were the major developments of the day: Opposition leader Peter Dutton delivered his budget reply speech, calling Labor’s budget a “missed opportunity” while acknowledging with a small olive branch the role of the opposition wasn’t to “oppose everything”. The family and domestic violence leave bill has passed the parliament. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. The Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, ruled that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time further to criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs. Landry says Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Dutton, not her. Tony Burke has called on parliament to legislate Labor’s industrial relations bill for “secure jobs and better pay”. The Greens want it to have greater focus on women and casual workers. The Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. And the latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. And there we have it. Mike Bowers was there, and captured a moment prior to the speech when former PM Scott Morrison shook hands with Dutton. As opposition, Coalition ‘will stand against Labor’s broken promises’ He concludes his speech with a shoutout to infrastructure investment, and the Coalition’s $120bn in funding for infrastructure over the next 10 years. In contrast, this government’s first budget axed $2.8bn of infrastructure projects and further delayed $6.5bn worth of projects. Mr Speaker, we will work to restore that funding in government. He digs in at Labor for the $2.2bn commitment to a Suburban Rail Loop in Victoria to “Daniel Andrews to help with his re-election”, which he says is a blow to regional Victorians. We will work with farmers as they face difficult struggles because there was nothing for them in this budget. Labor’s intent to reduce methane emissions by 30% will drive up the cost of meat at the supermarket. It’s not only bad for farmers, but it’s just added to your grocery basket [if you eat meat]. Mr Speaker, in conclusion, Australians will recall that, prior to the election, prime minister Anthony Albanese promised that he would be a leader who wouldn’t run from responsibility. He promised to lead a government that steps up, does its job, and doesn’t always blame someone else. For all their moral posturing and for all their promises, Labor shows, time and again, that their rhetoric in opposition never matches their actions in government. You are never better off when Labor has its hands on the budget. As opposition, we will stand against Labor’s broken promises. We will have a clearly defined, positive and bold plan ahead of the next election to take our country forward. We will support hardworking Australians. We will support all Australians. And we will rebuild a stronger economy for your family and for our country. Thank you very much. Dutton also echoes the support in funding for Ukraine – a “devastating reminder” we shouldn’t take for granted peace since world war two. He says the funding is a “signal of our values” and the Coalition will “stand shoulder to shoulder” to provide more support, including announcements made today. The threat of conflict as we know in our own region is real. As many military leaders have warned, we have to be realistic about the increasing prospect of conflict. He says the AUKUS deal will give Australia the “best chance of peace” by collaborating with our “two most important allies”. I take this opportunity to thank the wonderful members of the ADF, along with first responders, local councillors, community leaders, volunteers, and many more for their efforts in supporting Australians and communities affected by the recent floods. In government, we invested a record amount in our veterans. I thank the government for continuing that investment. The number of veteran suicides in our country remains far, far too high. It is a national tragedy. And the Coalition strongly supports the government’s commitment to expand the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. Coalition supports Labor’s funding to end domestic violence Dutton praises Labor’s funding in the budget for ending domestic violence. We are all here in parliament to improve lives of Australians, especially children. He says his experience as a police officer particularly embedded this view. I saw the best and worst in society has to offer. I attended countless domestic violence incidents … the Coalition will invest significantly in these family support services and also to protect women and children from sexual assault. On to jobs. Dutton says Labor has “no plan” to save predicted job losses in the coming four years. Across the economy employers are crying out for workers – in June, the Coalition announced a policy to double the age and veteran service pension from $300 to $600 per fortnight … to allow older Australians and veterans to work more if they choose to do so without losing their pension payments … Labor’s policy is about 25% less than the Coalition’s proposal, and right now, we need more incentive in the system to get people more into work. He says Labor’s budget will “empower unions” and be a “throwback to the 1980s”. Labor’s changes will impose industry-wide one size fits all conditions … the last time they used strikes to pursue sector wide ultimatums, was in 1982. And in that year, unemployment reached 9.4%, inflation 12.4% and 2m working days were lost in industrial disputation. Labor housing promise a ‘Kevin Rudd design’ with no detail Dutton says the Coalition would help first home buyers to access their super for the “super homebuyer support” plan, announced during the election campaign. Currently, a superfund can be used to buy residential or commercial rental property, to buy shares or even livestock … except a home to live in … with $100,000 from super, the first home buyers wouldn’t have been able to afford their home. With access to super, they have a home to live in. If the house was sold after a decade, the $100,000 will be worth around $214,000. And if that was reinvested back, as would require, the couple would end up with a balance from that amount in the super when they retire of over $1 million. Under the Coalition government, we will extend the same option to women … with very few housing options and those who are increasingly left homeless. The Coalition has a strong record when it comes to getting first-time buyers and second parent families into their first homes. We support initiatives to increase the supply of housing but the government initiative has no detail. The Labor government has promised 1m additional homes in five years costing $10bn. Now, does anyone believe that? It’s a Kevin Rudd design. Dutton turns to family. He says his teenage boys are in their exams period in Brisbane and his wife is there “making sure they are studying and not watching television”. But I wanted to mention my parents, they are both unwell, unable to travel down but my dad was a bricklayer, my mum was a secretary … my parents had a very strong work ethic, the taught us to appreciate the value of money. We had a lot of support and love and not much money. It was a time when Labor was residing with high interest rates and unemployment. And it was a terrible time for the building industry. I was encouraged to get a part-time job as many kids in my generation [were] … From grade seven, I worked in a butcher shop after school and on Saturday mornings, scrubbing floors and washing up and serving on the counter. It was tough work but it was character building and gave me an appreciation for many different perspectives. I saved like crazy, one of my proudest achievements was buying my first home. It was nothing flashy and less than $90,000 from memory but it was mine. And today it is much higher. Dutton accuses Labor of planning to scrap stage-three tax cuts Back to tax. Dutton says “cost-of-living relief is interconnected with tax relief”. In a bit of a Thatcher throwback: You should keep more of what you own, hard-working Australia should be rewarded and the best reward is lower taxes. He touts the stage three-tax cuts, which will “lower tax for more than 10 million Australians” and “simplify our tax system”. Our plan means that the top 5% of income earners will pay 33% more income tax, you can work hard, take an extra shift or get a pay rise … without suddenly being pushed into a high tax bracket. Stage-three tax relief comes into effect on July of 2024 and … after interest rate rises, that’s when our economy will need it most. That’s when Australians especially deserve it. He says Labor has “laid the groundwork” to break their commitment to the tax cuts. The budget is intended to soften up Australia, gives the government time, with more excuses by May of next year, to tax more. Australia must follow US, UK and others on nuclear energy Now Dutton turns to nuclear energy. He says Labor is “misleading Australians” when it says it can “run out billions of dollars worth of transmission wires, cables and towers for renewable energies in just the next few years”. Regional communities … will be carpeted with up to 28,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines. Almost the entire coastline of mainland Australia or the distance of travelling from Melbourne to Perth four times. Every dollar spent will be paid for by consumers through higher electricity bills. He says Canada, France, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US are all investing in “next-generation zero emissions nuclear small modular reactors to shore up energy security” and reach targets. The imperative to create affordable, reliable and emission free energy by the Coalition is seeking an intelligent conversation on the role of these new-age nuclear technologies. Investing in renewables is ‘crucial’ but Labor is phasing out fossil fuels too soon, Dutton says Dutton says investing in renewable energy and reducing emissions to protect the environment is “crucial” – quite a change of pace from the bring a bit of coal to work days. “We want a sustainable and sensible pathway to reduce our emissions,” he says, but “the technology does not exist” at the scale currently needed to rely on renewable energy at night or during peak periods. It is just the scientific reality. [We need to] use coal and gas, hydro, hydrogen, nuclear or battery as the energy source … when renewables are not fitting the system but Labor is going to phase out coal and gas before the new technology is being rolled out. In this budget the government makes it harder for more gas supply at a time when we need it most. On Tuesday night we saw the government rip up funding for gas exploration and cancel gas infrastructure projects which will eliminate shortfalls and make your bills cheaper. They handed over funding to environmental activists who want to overturn gas project approvals … a push for 82% renewables comes without a plan. Dutton continues to languish in the past for awhile. He says Australia “emerged as the envy of most nations” from Covid-19 in terms of its economic position. When you hear Labor carry on about a wasted decade, it is a distraction from the fact this government has no economic plan. And Labor will continue to misrepresent the truth until the next election to mask their bad decisions, most notably upon energy policy. He says six months ago the prime minister promised electricity bills would go down under his government, by $275. In this budget, instead of going down as promised, Labor’s plan was the electricity bills go up by more than 56% over the next two years [this wasn’t their plan as much as modelling]. Not only that, of course, but your gas bill will go up by more than 44%. Pensioners cannot afford that level of increase, and not just pensioners, self-funded retirees, families and small businesses as well, in fact, most Australians. In Europe we are hearing about people having to choose between paying their power bills or putting food on the table. Between heating or eating, this winter. Their electricity and gas bills are spiralling out of control … and despite those warnings and lessons, this government is following in the footsteps. Dutton: ‘We did not get everything right … but we kept the nation afloat’ Dutton lays out the Coalition’s priorities and where he says the budget has failed – energy policy, tax relief, housing, job shortages, industrial relations and infrastructure in the regions. He says the budget shows “yet again” that Labor “cannot manage the economy when it forms government” – a line that has been repeated by the Coalition for decades. Dutton contends there’s a “historical pattern” of Labor “creating a mess and the Coalition cleaning it up”, pointing to Howard after Keating, Abbott after Rudd/Gillard and the “back in black” 2019 budget … prior to Covid-19, and the biggest economic downturn since the great depression. It was only due to our economic management over the seven years prior to the pandemic that we were in a strong position to implement a suite of support measures. With 2020 hindsight we did not get everything right and some of the state lockdowns went on for far too long … but under our policies, we kept the nation afloat. Dutton says the prime minister has “broken his faith” with the public by admissions in the budget papers that by Christmas, a typical family would be $2,000 worse off. He admits this is amid war in Ukraine and surging power prices globally. Under the Labor budget, electricity prices are set to rise by more than 56% and gas prices by more than 44%. And we note that at these difficult times, nations around the world are contending with economic challenges born from the pandemic and amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but thanks to the Coalition … the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. Cost of living is going up partly due to global conditions but also due to this Labor government’s decision. The treasurer said this government makes hard decisions for hard times but I say it makes … hard times even harder for all Australians. Whether you are young, raising a family or retired, whether you’re an employee or running a business, on Tuesday, the treasurer failed to mention in his speech what Labor’s paper revealed, everything is going up except your wages. Cost of living, power prices, taxes, interest rates, unemployment and the deficit are going up or will be going up under the government’s predictions … you have every right to be anxious and disappointed. Coalition does not oppose everything in the budget Dutton says the Coalition doesn’t oppose everything in the budget, nor is that the job of the opposition. He says the Coalition supports the childcare subsidy, investment into medicine, combatting domestic violence and funding towards flood recover. We do not disagree with everything in this budget and policy must be judged on its merits – if it is good for you, we will support it … there were several good measures in the budget. The extension of the childcare subsidy to more Australian families, the commitment to reduce the price of medicine. The initiative to combat domestic violence and the funding to help Australians recover from devastating floods. Labor budget ‘weakens Australia’s financial position’, Dutton says Dutton says the budget didn’t address economic challenges Australians are facing to “inspire confidence”. It is a budget that weakens Australia’s financial position rather than strengthens it and it adds to rather than alleviates cost of living pressures. Then he’s straight to anecdotes. “Kel” runs a multigenerational IGA supermarket in Queensland. He negotiated a commercial and industrial energy contract when the Coalition was in government and power prices were much lower than they are now. Today, his business is threatened as he faces an increase of $160,000 on the power bill from last year alone. The energy costs will go up further. A friendly reminder the Coalition were in government until the end of May. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is up. He starts his speech praising the nation, calling the budget a “missed opportunity” to help Australians at a time of uncertainty. We live in the best country in the world but for millions of Australians things are not easy now, [we are] facing increasing financial pressures, mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling up at the petrol station. Cost of living is skyrocketing and may soon be out of control yet it can be kept in check. But not while this Labor government makes bad economic decisions. A reminder, we will be hearing from the leader of the opposition Peter Dutton at 7.30 tonight as he gives his budget reply. We’ll keep the live blog open for the duration of the speech. Landry says not the first time Albanese has ‘treated me with disrespect’ Michelle Landry has issued a statement following criticisms regarding the conduct of the prime minister during Question Time today. Speaker of the house and Labor MP, Milton Dick, has ruled that Anthony Albanese was not disrespectful in an answer to Landry this afternoon, saying he was directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. Landry sees it differently. She says she was “yelled at and screamed at” across the chamber and felt “intimidated and bullied”. I respectfully ask the prime minister to publicly apologise to me in the House of Representatives. Albanese speaks to new UK PM Anthony Albanese has congratulated the UK’s new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on his new role. If all goes to plan in UK politics, they will hold their first bilateral meeting next month, at the G20 in India. Severe weather warning for Victoria’s southern alps Damaging winds averaging 60 to 70 km/h with peak gusts to 100 km/h are possible over Alpine areas in Mt Baw Baw on Friday afternoon. Further to the criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs, the Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, has now ruled quickly that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time earlier. Dick, also a Labor MP, told the house just before the chamber adjourned for the day: I have reviewed the footage and I can confirm that the prime minister was answering the question from the member for Capricornia. During the answer, the prime minister was also directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. In reviewing the footage, I did not see the prime minister show any disrespect to the member for Capricornia. As the footage was not on the member for Capricornia for the entire response, I did not see her leave the chamber. Of the Capricornia that I was able to review, she appeared engaged in the response to the prime minister. Landry, along with the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, and other MPs have demanded Albanese apologise. Landry said the PM called her to say he didn’t mean to upset her. We’ve contacted Albanese’s office for response, and his side of the phone call. Meanwhile, Canberra’s own David Pocock has been up and about today: Fossil fuels 90% responsible for energy crisis – report The Climate Council has responded to a new global report which has found fossil fuels are 90% responsible for the energy crisis. The IEA’s 2022 World Energy Outlook, released today, found gas alone was 50% to blame for energy prices increasing. Former Origin Energy executive Andrew Stock, now a councillor with the Climate Council, said this week’s federal budget “spelled grim news for Australians already feeling the pinch”: The IEA report has made it abundantly clear that fossil fuels are the root cause of this problem, particularly gas, which is the most expensive form of power in Australia. This global report points to an obvious, affordable solution - a rapid transition to renewable energy. Which would be a win for households, businesses, jobs and the climate. Solar and wind are the cheapest sources of power globally, and are already outcompeting fossil fuels. The report highlights the forecast increase in total global energy demand to 2030 will be met almost entirely by renewables. The message for Australia is clear. After a wasted decade, we are now on the right track, but have tremendous ground to make up. The Climate Council says based on Australia’s high emissions, economic strength and untapped opportunities for renewable energy, it should be aiming to reduce its emissions to 75% below 2005 levels by 2030. As expected the Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. The purchases of mostly federal (but some state) debt helped lower the borrowing costs for the then Morrison government (which also splurged $300bn-plus to keep the economy afloat). All up, the RBA more than tripled the size of its balance sheet to about $650bn when its special bond purchasing program stopped. Anyway, with interest rates rising, it had to reflect the lower market value of all that debt. For the domestic bonds alone, the unrealised valuation losses were $40.3bn. The overall accounting loss for the year was $36.7bn, a record with sunshine second. Equity also dropped to negative $12.4bn. But as the RBA report said: This negative equity position does not affect the Bank’s operations or its ability to operate effectively or perform its policy functions. The Board expects that the Bank’s capital will be restored over time due to positive underlying earnings and capital gains when bonds mature. What’s the take away? Treasury should not expect any dividends from the RBA for a long time. Also of interest, so to speak: Governor Phil Lowe’s total compensation dropped about 3.6% from the previous year, to a tad under $1.037m, or about $20,000 a week. Helen Haines welcomes announcement of single-site hospital for Albury-Wodonga Member for Indi Helen Haines has welcomed the announcement that Albury Wodonga Health will be redeveloped into an expanded single-site hospital. If you missed it earlier, the NSW and Victorian premiers fronted the media to announce a joint plan to overhaul Albury base hospital with a $558m redevelopment. Haines said she had made the case for a new hospital to the prime minister in their first conversation after the election. Doctors, health professionals, patients and the wider community have been campaigning for a new hospital for years and I have proudly stood beside them … this announcement is reward for our advocacy, the result of constantly fighting for our healthcare to be taken seriously by every level of government. This re-developed single-site hospital will benefit people all over North Eastern Victoria and Southern NSW – more care will be available close to home without having to travel to Melbourne. We will no longer face situations where some services are offered at one site, and other services on the other side of the border. Patients won’t wait hours to be transferred, or for specialists to travel from one hospital to another. This will lead to better health outcomes and be safer for patients.” But Haines argued it still falls short of what many in the community had lobbied for and wasn’t “the end of the fight on our health care”, with more needed to improve funding in regional and rural areas. She will be appearing in Wodonga tomorrow afternoon to hold a press conference. Greens call for Labor to put ‘women and carers first’ in proposed industrial relations bill The Greens have called for Labor’s proposed changes to industrial law to put “women and carers first” and lift wages of the low paid following workplace relations minister Tony Burke’s introduction of the bill to the house today. The party is aware its vote will be key to the industrial relations bill passing through the Senate. Senator Barbara Pocock, Greens spokesperson for employment, said evidence from submissions before the select committee on work and care showed 5 million people were trying to balance work with caring responsibilities. We need to move from the Hunger Games to roster justice, and decent work. That means adequate notice of shift changes, negotiation, minimum hours. Our major supermarkets can predict the kinds and quantities of apples they will buy tomorrow, but apparently can’t tell their workers what shifts they’re working. Being unable to plan your life or see your kids is hugely stressful. Many workers withdraw from the labour market because it’s impossible to juggle taking care of the kids and keep working. Australian workers, especially women, have waited decades for flexibility that actually works for them. They’ve waited for justice in their rosters, rosters and predictability of their working time. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the party had argued for a long time that industrial relations in Australia was broken. Pressure on workers has been growing for too long, wages have been too low, and people haven’t been able to bargain for better pay and conditions. Labor needs the support of the Greens to pass this bill. The Greens want industrial relations laws that work for women, work for carers and lift the wages of the lowest paid. That’s what we’ll be looking for as we work our way through this bill. Read about the bill here: The Bureau of Meteorology has released its climate outlook for the November to January period. Not great, but unsurprising news for some – rainfall is likely to remain above average for most of eastern Australia, particularly in the month of November. La Niña, a negative Indian Ocean dipole, an expected positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode and warmer waters around Australia are contributing to the wetter conditions. The BoM: For the fortnight 31 October to 13 November, above median rainfall is likely for most of eastern Australia. This increases to very likely for north-east and far south-east parts of the mainland. Below median rainfall is likely for large parts of Western Australia extending into the western Northern Territory. Maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of north-west Australia and Tasmania. Below median temperatures are likely for southern Queensland, and most of New South Wales and Victoria. Minimum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of the northern halves of Queensland and the Northern Territory, and south-eastern Australia. Many thanks to Amy Remeikis for keeping us informed on a mammoth day, during a mammoth week. We’ll be keeping the blog open a little longer tonight to catch the opposition leader’s budget reply speech. And on that note, I will hand you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through the evening. That’s it from me until the house sits again on 7 November – which is also when we will get budget estimates. Huzzah. In the meantime, thank you for joining me this budget week – you have all helped us get through it. Please – take care of you. Michelle Landry speaks here: Michelle Landry says Anthony Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Peter Dutton, not her. The latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. Medibank reported on Thursday afternoon that it had become clear overnight that the attacker had accessed patient information associated with the program that Medibank runs with Calvary on behalf of Wellbeing SA and the South Australian government. The insurer says the data accessed includes personal information and some health data. The My Home Hospital program provides services such as doctor visits, X-rays, blood tests, medication and meals in the home. Medibank said it has begun directly contacting the 4,400 affected patients, and that it had determined the data has been accessed, but did not know whether the data was taken from Medibank systems. Patients admitted on or after 13 October aren’t affected, Medibank said. Medibank has established a dedicated phone support service for My Home Hospital patients (My Home Hospital Cyber Response 1800 081 245). Josh Butler and Mike Bowers are at Sussan Ley and Michelle Landry’s press conference. We will bring you what they said very soon. (It is not being broadcast.) This was the beginning of Anthony Albanese’s answer to Michelle Landry’s question. You can hear Peter Dutton ask “where’s Yeppen?” Sussan Ley will hold a press conference in about 15 minutes. This is the subject line: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Capricornia and Coalition women will hold a press conference in the Opposition Courtyard of Parliament House in Canberra. Troubled air traffic management project to face increased scrutiny A new air traffic management system has been placed on the federal government’s defence project watchlist after delays and cost blowouts. The troubled project is called the Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System. It will replace the air traffic control systems at 12 Australian Defence Force (ADF) base locations with a new system that also covers non-military air traffic. Under the plans, Defence and Airservices Australia aim “to harmonise Australia’s civil and military air traffic management systems”. There should be “increased cooperation and collaboration between Airservices and Defence”, according to the project summary. But the minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, announced this afternoon that the government had added it to Defence’s Projects of Concern list, a move that triggers increased scrutiny to try to fix problems: The Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System project has been listed as a Project of Concern because of significant schedule, technical and cost challenges ... The project has seen a two-year delay to forecast Initial and Final Operational Capability in the past two years. It is my expectation that this listing brings more high-level attention, resources and energy – from both Defence and our industry partner Thales Australia – to the task of remediating this project. It is not the first time this project has been listed as a Project of Concern. The Coalition listed it as such in August 2017, but a contract was signed the following year and was moved to the less-serious “Project of Interest” list. Michelle Landry leaves the chamber Michelle Landry left the chamber after Anthony Albanese’s answer to her question. I wasn’t in the chamber, so only saw the broadcast – and Albanese, when he was all agitated and yelling about the difference between Rockhampton (which Landry had asked about) and Yeppoon (which seemed to come as an interjection from Peter Dutton) didn’t address that part to Landry. But her position in the chamber, just to the side and back of Dutton, may have made it seemed like he was. The rest of the answer – about how the government would fund the project the Coalition was unable to (eventually it seems, the funding has been delayed) appeared to be addressed to the opposition at large. But at the same time, parliament seems to be the only place where yelling in the workplace is part of the culture. Opposition supports government’s announcement of more assistance for Ukraine Andrew Hastie has responded to the news Australian troops will be helping to train Ukrainian troops in Europe: The Coalition welcomes the Government’s announcement of further support to Ukraine, including an additional 30 Bushmasters to bolster efforts on the ground and the deployment of 70 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to help train Ukrainian reservists in the UK. For some weeks now, Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko has been calling for additional assistance from Australia and we are pleased to see those calls being answered. The ADF is among the most highly regarded armed forces in the world and we expect the 70 personnel being deployed to the UK will serve our country with distinction as they always do. It is a critical time for the Ukrainian government and people, who have defended their country with lion-hearts. They’ve won significant battlefield victories lately, and they are counting on our support to build on their gains. This assistance builds on the more than $285 million in military and humanitarian assistance delivered under the former Coalition government – including the original contribution of M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs), Bushmaster vehicles, M777 towed howitzers and ammunition, as well as anti-armour weapons and other weapons. Australia staunchly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty as we continue to call on Russia to cease their unprovoked, unjust, and illegal war. The Opposition supports the Government identifying ongoing assistance to Ukraine and welcomes the opportunity to receive full details about this announcement in the near future. Question time chats as captured by Mike Bowers: Anthony Albanese was quite shouty today. And question time, finally, finally ends. Sussan Ley wants the Speaker to review “the tone” of Anthony Albanese’s response to the question from Michelle Landry. Ley says Landry “left the chamber in tears” and wants a review of the footage. Milton Dick said he will review the footage and report back. Question time is still going because this week will never end and we are all living in the worst timeline. There won’t be the usual rush to the airport after this either, as the budget reply speech means that the MPs have to all hang around. Anthony Albanese, from NSW, just out-Queenslanded Queenslander Peter Dutton. Michelle Landry asked this question (she is the member for Capricornia, in Queensland). The federal government is intending to delay $800 million of commonwealth funding to construct the Rockhampton Ring Road by at least two years. (The rest of the question is about whether Anthony Albanese is breaking his promise to the people of Capricornia.) Anthony Albanese starts speaking about Rockhampton flood plains projects and the Yeppen lagoon, and then Peter Dutton interjects with something about Yeppoon, which is most definitely not in Rockhampton. Albanese: Yeppoon is a different place! Yeppoon is a different place, and you might want to ask the member for Capricornia, because Yeppoon is on the coast, north of Rockhampton and Yeppen floodplain is to the south. It’s the southern entry of the Bruce Highway into Rockhampton! Queenslander! It says it all! It says it all! He goes on with a bit of spring in his step about how Labor will get the project done. The member for Longman, Terry Young, has a question for Chris Bowen: I refer to an answer earlier this week on RGS, a manufacturer of my electorate that uses over 200 megawatt-hours per year [that experienced an] increase of about $40,000 in power bills. The default market offer to which the minister referred in his answer is only available to small businesses that consume 100 mega kilowatt hours. The minister did not answer my question. I ask again, [on] the prices facing this and many other businesses … what is the government doing about it? Bowen: Thank you very much. I thank the honourable member for his question. My concern goes to all businesses in Queensland and across the country. It also goes to all households across Australia and their energy bills, because we want to work and we are working and we will work to ensure that our prices are as well as possible. … In the budget we had a choice. We could have penned the pressures on power prices, option A, that the previous government took. We could have hit that, or option B is to be upfront with the Australian people about the pressures. That’s the option we took. That’s the option we took, we have the option of being honest to the Australian people. And that is where Angus Taylor gets booted out, given his interjections ramp up. Bowen: It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us. We are concerned and upfront in relation to Queensland small businesses, small or large or medium, we should care about them all. The increase in small-business prices was 12.8%, $705 and I make no apologies appointed out of the house and the Australian people. Paul Fletcher: This repeated claim of hiding … the standing orders are very clear. All imputations of improper motives to a member shall be considered highly disorderly. It is clearly what this minister is repeatedly doing, and I ... Chris Bowen: Certainly. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact is … the previous minister hid the facts and he should be ashamed of himself. Angus Taylor has been booted from the chamber under 94A. “It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us,” Chris Bowen says. Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus. Amanda Rishworth takes a dixer just to remind everyone the Coalition called mothers “double dippers” on the paid parental leave payment (when they were legally taking what their work offered and topping it up with the government plan, as was intended) on Mothers’ Day. Good times. (Also a reminder that paid parental leave and increasing the childcare subsidy doesn’t make it a “family” budget. Your family can look any way you want it to, and it doesn’t have to involve children – and that is before we get to the people who have older children who don’t use the subsidy any longer.) The member for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, seems to have practised delivering this question a few times. We love a fresh delivery. Get those toastmaster points! McIntosh: In the lead-up to the 2022 election, and since, the government has repeatedly cited modelling forecasting that wholesale and residential electricity prices would decrease by 18% but the government’s budget tells us that Australians can expect increases in electricity, gas prices of 50% and 40% respectively. Will the prime minister now admit that the modelling Labor stood by was flawed and so too are the government’s energy policies that relied on that modelling? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. Indeed, we did release modelling done by RepuTex in 2021. After that occurred, of course, there was not modelling but in fact, a factual change that occurred in May 2022 from the Australian Energy Regulator that pointed to a 20% increase in costs of electricity, and that flowed through to wholesale prices. Of course, there are a couple of pressures on energy prices. One, of course, is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the second ... (interjections, etc) … What I was asked about occurred in 2021. If you go back to when the Russian invasion of Ukraine was, I think you’ll find out, because I remember, because you should recall President Zelensky spoke just before my last budget reply in March of this year to this chamber. The second pressure, of course, is the failure to invest, the fact that four gigs went out and one gig of energy went in. … That led to a massive failure to invest. Three years ago, before the 2019 election, of course, there was a promise of a billion dollars towards new generation, a billion dollars. That would have added to 3,800 megawatts of new generation. So that would have meant instead of four out one in, that would have been 4.8 out - in and four in. (there is about 10 seconds of interjections and calls for order) … Three years later not a single dollar of that was delivered. Not a dollar, … not any megawatts, they aimed for 3,800, they delivered zero, zero, zero, a big duck egg. Not one watt of new generation as a result of that announcement. Of course that’s before we go to the farcical situation of the Collinsville promise that was never delivered either. And he’s out of time. Catherine King ‘rejects entirely’ idea that Darwin investment for gas-based manufacturing is subsidy for fossil fuels Dr Monique Ryan has another of the crossbench questions (and this is what Stephen Bates was getting at) My question is for the minister for infrastructure and regional development. In this week’s budget, your government allocated $1.5 billion for the Middle Arm industrial zone in Darwin Harbour. Middle Arm proposes Perth chemical manufacturing using gas from the Beetaloo Basin. Unless that changes, this is a subsidy for the fossil fuel industries. Will you guarantee the Middle Arm precinct will not produce petrochemicals or gas-based manufacturing? Catherine King: Thanks very much to the member for Kooyong for your question. Well, the Australian government invests in projects such as the Middle Arm precinct in an important way of setting up our economy for a sustainable future. Instead of funding any particular companies or particular industries, we’re actually investing in common use enabling infrastructure. We do that across industrial precincts across the country to give all potential users in the market the opportunity to grow and thrive. This includes those able to process and export green hydrogen and energy transition components made locally. The government is providing in the budget $1.9 billion in planned equity to support the development of Middle Arm, together with regional logistic hubs in the Northern Territory across those key transport links. That’s what we’re doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive, to be sustainable, with a focus, I recognise that the - I can hear some interjections from the member for New England about that. He likes this - I know he likes this particular project, which I’m very happy about. (Interjections) … No, no, I was, I was actually acknowledging that that’s what he was doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive and sustainable but it will focus on low emission hydro-carbons, green hydrogen and critical minerals processing. Demand we know ... Ryan gets up and she is not happy with what she has been hearing: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was hoping for an answer to my question. Spicy! But not a point of order. Still, nice to see another new member of the crossbench settling in to the rhythm of the place. King: As we know, the demand is growing for clean energy sources and Labor’s investment will help position the Northern Territory and Northern Australia to actually diversify their economy and to create jobs. This investment is not a subsidy for fossil fuels. I reject that entirely. Rather funding will go towards the infrastructure that will support users to export clean energy, critical to meet our commitment to net zero. Like green hydrogen and lithium batteries that are critical, critical, to decarbonisation, common user infrastructure at Middle Arm and industrial precincts across the country which the commonwealth regularly invests is included in Infrastructure Australia’s infrastructure priority list of nationally significant proposals and the project is currently at the stage 2 assessment process. The Middle Arm precinct is undergoing significant environmental assessments under the Northern Territory Environment Protection Act and the federal Environmental protection and biodiversity Act. These assessments will understand the impact of the proposed construction in the Northern Territory has completed and commenced over 200 investigations including feasibility studies into land and marine development and environmental culture and heritage. This is good for the Territory. It’s good for the nation. And I reject absolutely it being a fossil fuel subsidy. David Littleproud is back! My question is again to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new poles and wires under the government’s energy policy. Chris Bowen: Again, Mr Speaker, this is the new culture war from the leader of the National party and I wish him well on it. If this is the hill he chooses to die on, Mr Speaker, that’s a matter for him. Because he’s referring to the green hydrogen superpower option under the ISP which was released while they were in office. Which was released while they were the government, Mr Speaker. It’s actually a document which had bipartisan support, Mr Speaker. … He refers to the government’s 28,000km of transmission lines. In fact, we’re implementing – seeking to implement the ISP step change model. He’s talking about something completely fraudulent, Mr Speaker. And also we are getting on with the job of better consultation because what really matters is route selection. Route selection, there are options to where the routes go. They can go on public land, they can after appropriate community consultation and appropriate conversation go with private land. So I guess could a nuclear power plant which the leader of the National Parties seems so addicted to. It is back to David Littleproud’s poles and wires question – this is something he has been asking about for the last couple of days: My question is to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new polls and wires under government’s energy policy? Angus Taylor has a lot to say as Chris Bowen comes up to the despatch box. Bowen: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. The leader of the National Party refers to the ISP, the integrated systems plan, the 28,000km figure refers to the green jersey superpower scenario. 10,000km is a step change. The Government is getting on with implementing the ISP through the rewiring the nation policy. Just tomorrow, the nation’s Energy Ministers will meet and review progress in reforming the regulatory process of transmission to improve community consultation and compensation - a process started by this Government. Not started by the previous Government because we want to ensure communities are consulted properly. Littleproud: Relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was very tight. It asks for a specific number of properties that will be impacted by the 28,000km of poles and wires. Milton Dick: Thank you for that. The minister is in order. He’s been going for 40 ... There are interjections from Littleproud, and Dick continues: If you let me finish, leader of the Nationals. He’s been going for 40 seconds. There was a specific question in there regarding a number and I will ask the minister to return when he’s ready to that part of the question and I give him the call. Bowen: Thank you, Mr Speaker. And the leader of the National party asked me about the 28,000km which is the green hydrogen superpower scenario and 28,000km under that scenario, which was prepared under the previous Government. Mr Speaker, as I said, energy ministers tomorrow are reviewing the progress in reforming the RET. We’re hearing from the renewable energy commissioner, a federal government appointee, who has been working with the New South Wales state government and doing excellent work, Mr Speaker, just this week. They announced a new compensation regime for people impacted. Now the leader of the National party is very concerned about social licence. I welcome his interest. I welcome his interest in the social licence ... The interjections go up to 11 so Dick has to step in again: You may resume your seat. Order. When the House comes to order, I’ll ask the minister to address that part of the question. He’s still got 1.5 minutes to go. I’m listening ... listening carefully to his answer. He has three minutes to answer the question. There is no time constraint about when he has to answer. I’m listening quite carefully. The Leader of the House. Tony Burke: Just to raise a point of order. There’s the normal rule about a point of order on direct relevance only being able to be taken once. The opposition having already raised that have now decided from the interjections to not be shouting at the government but in fact to be shouting at you and about your ruling and I just want to draw your attention to it and in my role as Leader of the House, just... (There are more interjections) Burke: Your can interject on me all you want, but you don’t do it to the Speaker. Dick: Order. Members on my left [the opposition] – members on my left will cease interjecting. I’ll ask the minister to return to that part of the question and I told the House I’m listening carefully to the answer. The minister may continue. Bowen finishes with: We’ll continue to work with the renewable energy commissioner, with my states and territories colleagues, and continue to oppose your plans to put nuclear reactors right across Australia which doesn’t have community support or licence. Opposition’s strategy was to arm Australian defence ‘with press releases’, defence minister says Richard Marles takes a dixer (a question the government has written itself) on defence procurement, so he can reprosecute some old numbers, but with some new hoo-hah: In coming to office, the Albanese Labor government has inherited a defence procurement mess. When those opposite were in power, there were 28 different programs that were running a total of 97 years over time. Hunter class frigates four years late - $50 billion over budget. The Spartan battle field aircraft, 4.5 years late, offshore patrol vessels a year late, Cape class patrol vessels another year late, that’s before we even start talking about submarines. When it came to defence announcements, those opposite were best in class. Vaudeville, Hoopla, we saw Top Gun music, all showtime. It was as if they were trying to tap-dance our adversaries into submission ... Their strategy was to have Australia walk on to the battlefield armed with press releases. But when it comes to actually delivering capability, getting the hard power equation right, those opposite were the single worst defence procurement government in our nation’s history, and not least because they, themselves, were a picture of chaos. In nine years we had six, really seven different defence ministers, the last of whom is sitting right there as the leader of the opposition. All of this at a time when we are facing the most precarious strategic circumstances since the second world war. Under those opposite, Australia’s lost decade could not have come at a more damaging historic moment. Big and medium-sized businesses support budget, Albanese says It’s time for Angus Taylor to ask about the cost of living which is one of the things in question time Jim Chalmers and half of the Labor bench seem to live for. Taylor: My question is to the prime minister. The budget confirms that a typical family will be $2,000 worse off by Christmas with inflation, interest rates and unemployment all forecast to go up. Given this increasing pressure on the cost of living, what specific action is the government taking to fast-track new natural gas projects and when can Australians expect to see relief? Anthony Albanese: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the shadow treasurer for his question. Of course, they had a shadow treasurer even when they had a treasurer. But we have one treasurer and he’s done a fantastic job. And the budget has been well received by people who are economically literate. … This is what Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council had to say: ‘Amid global economic turmoil, this budget steadies the ship and sets the groundwork for reform to drive economic growth in the May budget. This is a cautious and careful budget that avoids making our inflation problem worse. ‘This is a crucial first step to restoring our budget position and building our national resilience. We welcome investments to boost productivity and participation through skills, education, child care and expanding paid parental leave. We strongly support the Government’s comprehensive skills package and migration announcement.’ … But the ACCI said this, and Drew Mackellar said this: ‘Tonight’s budget is a responsible one. This budget covers the essential elements of economic management and tackling growing cost pressures. ‘As the budget warns, we cannot afford to be complacent against a global headwinds of severe inflation, climbing interest rates and soaring energy prices. Through the Powering Australia plan and funding for new energy infrastructure, the budget finds significant investment to underpin the transition to a net zero future that supports new opportunity for industry.’ So we have big business supporting the budget. We have medium-sized business supporting the budget. (There are a bunch of interjections and I miss the middle part of the answer.) This is what the Master Builders had to say, again, apparently an affiliate of the Labor party: ‘The 2022 housing accord is a welcome signal to the building and construction industry who have been crying out for action to address housing affordability barriers and supply constraints.’ I have got more, Mr Speaker, but I’ll wait for the next question for the further endorsements done by people who used to be their allies, who they now ridicule. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on how Labor supports women. Moving on. Not sure if some in the opposition needed a trigger warning, because Greens MP Stephen Bates has one of the crossbench questions and he is still not wearing a tie*. I’m sure one of the clerks has the smelling salts ready just in case. Bates: my question is to the minister for industry, science and resources. Why does the budget contain more than $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies including $30 million to frack for gas in the Beetaloo Basin and almost $2 billion to fund a gas export terminal in Darwin Harbour when we are in the middle of a climate emergency? Ed Husic seems happy to get a call up, but he doesn’t have much of an answer for Bates. But he, in what has become his way in his dealings with the crossbench, keeps it very civil and polite. Thank you very much, Speaker, and thank you to the member for the question. A lot of that is not directed necessarily in my own portfolio and relates to other areas, but we’re happy to take it on notice and we’ll get back to you with some response. *we approve of the no tie, btw. Blame for state of energy markets ‘rests squarely with Vladimir Putin’, treasurer says Jim Chalmers gets a dixer just to give Peter Dutton a sledge ahead of his budget reply speech: We’re told today that the leader of the opposition in his speech tonight about the appropriations wants to talk about the [previous] government’s economic record. And this is his opportunity – he takes very seriously his responsibility as the leader of the leftovers, Mr Speaker, and in doing he has a rolled gold opportunity tonight to fess up for the Coalition record on the economy – and let’s consider it for a moment. Their record on the economy is skills shortages holding the economy back. It’s stagnant wages for a decade. It’s weak productivity and business investment. It’s an aged care crisis, it’s a trillion dollars in debt with nowhere near enough to show for it and it’s this energy policy chaos which is making us more vulnerable to global energy shocks. Mr Speaker, what we’re seeing in our energy markets right now, the blame for that, rests squarely with Vladimir Putin. Albanese: Business and ‘more enlightened members of the Liberal party’ both recognise renewables are cheaper And after Mark Butler has some fun in a dixer about how terrible he thought his predecessor was, we move to another groundhog day moment when Sussan Ley, who is still trying to work out how she plays her role as shadow minister for government attacks, asks: My question is to the prime minister. Yesterday, the treasurer finally confirmed that the Labor party misled the Australian people 97 times before the last election on their promise to reduce power bills by $275 when he admitted it wasn’t in the budget after saying it was. Given the treasurer has now apologised to one Australian over this – Charles Croucher from Nine News – when will the other 26 million Australians get their apology? And the chamber is in uproar. Anthony Albanese: Mr Speaker, I thank the deputy leader for her question. I reject the premise of the question. Because it goes to a failure for those opposite to actually recognise that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new energy. Yesterday I spoke about the deal that was done with the Tasmanian government and what they have to say, what the Victorian government have to say as well, and I spoke about what the New South Wales premier had to say. But I agree with the statement that the cheapest, most reliable and cleanest energy on the planet are renewables. I agree with the member for Barker. I agree the cheapest way to deliver electricity today is not coal, it’s not gas, it’s certainly not nuclear; it’s wind, solar, backed up by pumped hydro and batteries. So if you care about cheap energy and reliable energy, then you’re looking at wind, solar and pumped hydro. Now, they’re not my statements, Mr Speaker. They’re the statements of Matt Kean, the New South Wales treasurer, the deputy leader of this deputy leader’s party in New South Wales. Ley pretends she has a point of order: A point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. Why can’t the Prime Minister say $275 ... Milton Dick is not having it: Resume your seat. I was pretty clear yesterday about that abuse of standing order. The deputy leader has special privileges which she’s taken advantage of. I just remind all members to state the point of order of relevance. I will take the point but if it continues I will not take them anymore. I give the call to the prime minister. Albanese: Thanks. But it’s not just more enlightened members of the Liberal party who recognise that the earth is round and renewables are the cheapest form of new energy. It’s also the business community. It’s what Jennifer Westacott said … Jennifer said this: ‘You’ll also be paying less for your power because at the moment, building new renewables is cheaper than building new coal and cheaper electricity will continue to drive down energy prices.’ That is what the business community says, and that is what state and territory governments say. What do those opposite do? They pretend that they didn’t know. They pretend the former energy no-one didn’t know about regulations that he was delivering to hide a determination by the Australian Energy Regulator, until it just happened to be [that they] replaced the 1 May with 25 May. In between 1 May and 25 May? What happened? What was it that happened on 21 May? [The election, in case you forgot.] They wanted to avoid the Australian people before they voted, knowing about the hike in energy prices that was occurring on their watch because of their failure to invest in energy. And he runs out of time. Milton Dick gives a general warning to the whole chamber, because he is still trying to pretend he has control over the members. Peter Dutton asks Anthony Albanese to withdraw the “unparliamentary language” he used against Angus Taylor. Albanese: Mr Speaker, it’s one of the nicest things I’ve said about the shadow treasurer. Just wanted to give a bit of space between those posts and what is happening in the parliament now. Peter Dutton opens question time with: I refer to the economic plan and budget strategy available on the Labor party’s website, page seven of the document outlined a five-point economic plan, the first point is and I quote, ‘to cut power bills by $275 a year by 2025’. With the budget confirming this promise has been broken, will the prime minister admit the economic plan is in ruins? The Speaker, Milton Dick, tries to get ahead of the circus: The leader of the opposition has asked this question and I just said that the prime minister will be heard in silence. I want to be clear today, questions will be heard in silence out of respect of the office of the person asking them but also, answers will be heard in silence. And I give the call to the prime minister. (But also, lols – this is his circus and these are his monkeys, so good luck trying to wrangle this lot.) Albanese: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And indeed, before the election, there were a range of things said and indeed, when confronted with the fact that when in government, there was a warning of a pending spike in energy prices and that the announcement was delayed until after the election. This is what the former ... (INTERJECTIONS). … This is what the shadow treasurer said yesterday, the 26th of October, he said this: that was a report from the Australian Energy Regulator. It puts it out, not me, and I didn’t say it. That’s what he said. Yesterday, yesterday. Well, that’s interesting, Mr Speaker. Because this is the very document that goes to the increase that has occurred in the default retail price which has fed into energy prices increasing by figures around about 20%. He said he didn’t see it and didn’t know about it. An interesting statement. Here, of course, is a document, 22-23, the final determination of May 2022 and I tabled the document. I tabled a document from the Australian Energy Regulator. But at the same time, at the same time, here is the change in the law, dated the 31 March, 2022 and like he said, he didn’t see it, didn’t know about it, he puts it out, not me … Paul Fletcher: It’s on relevance. He’s had a 2-minute preamble. You should bring him back to the topic of the question, the $275 reduction that was promised. Albanese: Point of order, Mr Speaker. The question went to what was said about energy prices before the election in May 2022. My answer has gone to ... (The opposition benches all interject.) Albanese: I was going to what was happening to prices in May 2022, and [that] can’t be more relevant to the question that was asked by the leader of the opposition. So I’d ask you to rule against the point of order. Dick: The prime minister is correct when he says that the question was about five points announced before the election. The prime minister is referring to the policy announcement and what was announced, so the prime minister is being directly relevant. And I give the call to the prime minister. And then it is finally back to the answer. Albanese: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. And here’s the regulation, the change in the law, 31 March 2022, from Angus Taylor, who said he didn’t see it or know anything about it. There’s two simple changes. Item 1, paragraph 17, omit may substitute the first business day of 25 May. How subtle is that? How subtle is that? They changed the law ... in March, when the regulation – after parliament couldn’t disallow the change in regulation because we were going into caretaker mode and [couldn’t] change it until after the election. What a farce. You have no credibility. And he has run out of time. Ahead of question time, during the 90-second statements, the member for Hasluck, Tania Lawrence spoke about the death of 15-year-old Cassius Turvey. Linda Burney and Marion Scrymgour were also obviously distressed. Peter Dutton calls for royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities Both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton are speaking on the anniversary of the national apology to survivors and victims of institutional child sexual abuse. Dutton says it is time for an inquiry into the sexual abuse of Indigenous and First Nations children. Dutton: The national apology came to fruition because of the royal commission, and in the spirit of the fourth anniversary and our enduring commitment to keep children safe, it is time for a new royal commission to examine child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. We support immediate action from this government and the Northern Territory government on this incredibly important issue. I thank the prime minister and the minister for their time … [I have] met with the prime minister on two occasions now and it is an issue that we continue to work on together. The Coalition dedicates ourselves to supporting action taken by the government; there is goodwill on both sides for this national issue that needs addressing now. Law enforcement committee issues statement on Lidia Thorpe’s referral to privileges committee The parliamentary joint law enforcement committee, of which Lidia Thorpe was a member, giving rise to a potential conflict of interest with her relationship with ex bikie Dean Martin, has issued a statement about the controversy. On Tuesday the Senate referred Thorpe to the privileges committee for investigation, after the Greens senator agreed to refer herself. In its statement, the law enforcement committee said: [The committee] has met to consider questions arising from Senator Thorpe’s failure to declare a personal relationship that could potentially be a conflict of interest while she was a member of the committee during the last parliament. The committee takes the integrity of its proceedings very seriously and [in] its meeting the committee affirmed its commitments to protecting the confidentiality of sensitive and classified material ... The committee also affirmed that members should declare conflicts of interest that relate to their duties, so that the declared matters can be dealt with appropriately. The committee noted the referral to privileges, and said it would “cooperate with that inquiry and may provide evidence ... as appropriate”. Question time is just a moment away so we are in the chamber for the 90-second statements and Anthony Albanese has just taken one of those slots to pay tribute to outgoing NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard. Who is from the Liberal party. Peter Dutton associated himself with the comments. Newest inflation data prompts banks to predict higher RBA cash rate hikes On interest rates, reverberations from Wednesday’s inflation report, banks have shifted their predictions of what the RBA’s peak cash rate will be. The annual CPI came in at 7.3%, or the highest since mid-1990, as we noted here. Westpac now expects the central bank will return to hiking by 50 basis points when it meets on Melbourne Cup Day, next Tuesday, doubling their forecast. Anyway, here’s how another half-percentage point rate increase will lift monthly interest repayments, according to RateCity. The CPI result also triggered the banks to predict the RBA will now have to lift its cash rate higher. Here’s how the various outcomes would translate into monthly repayments: It’s worth noting the budget calculations on future growth in the economy were modelled on the RBA’s cash rate peaking at 3.35% next year. Perhaps Treasury will look like optimists by next May when the 2023-24 budget is released. Senate inquiry into school refusal established The senate has established an inquiry into school refusal, which is something Sophie Black has been looking into. This is the motion which established the inquiry – which was moved by Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne. The national trend of school refusal or “School Can’t” – as distinct from truancy – that is affecting primary and secondary school aged children, who are unable to attend school regularly or on a consistent basis, with specific reference to: 1) the increasing number since the Covid-19 pandemic, of young people and their families who are experiencing school refusal; 2) how school refusal is affecting young people and their families and the impacts it is having on the employment and financial security of parents and carers; 3) the impacts and demands of the increasing case load on service providers and schools to support these students and their families; 4) how relevant state, territory and federal departments are working to monitor and address this growing school refusal challenge; and 5) any other related matters. School refusal isn’t just a case of kids not wanting to go to school – it is a health issue, impacting their emotional and mental wellbeing and leading to anxiety, physical ailments and more. It has really hit some families very hard, particularly since the pandemic. They actually make you identify all these birds before allowing you into the ACT. It’s one of the rules. Business confidence holds up despite rising costs, NAB says In light of the budget, discussion about soaring energy prices and the record string of six consecutive RBA rate hikes, it’s worth checking on how the economy is actually faring. Well, according to NAB’s quarterly survey of small- and mid-sized enterprises, conditions are softening but remain above longer-term averages. Confidence even edged higher in the September quarter, with the smallest firms more chipper than bigger ones (even with conditions actually deteriorating more for them than for larger companies). “SMEs in transport, accommodation &amp; food, finance, and wholesale all reported strong conditions, while conditions remained fairly robust across the states,” it said. Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said: “Across all our surveys, firms are reporting capacity utilisation at record levels and SMEs are no exception. “Clearly, with a very tight labour market and very strong demand, even the smallest firms are operating close to their limits,” he said. The health minister, Mark Butler, says the government is expecting advice in coming months from immunisation experts on whether Australians should be given the opportunity for a fifth dose of Covid vaccine, but is still urging millions of people who haven’t got a third dose yet to get their booster. Butler held a short Parliament House press conference to celebrate the passage of Labor’s cheaper medicines bill passing the parliament. He was asked about whether Australians will be given an opportunity for a yearly Covid dose, similar to annual flu jabs. Butler didn’t say specifically whether all Australians would be recommended to get an annual dose, but said Atagi – the technical advisory group on immunisation – was considering whether older people and those with immune conditions should be granted a fifth dose, on top of the current four. Butler said Atagi would give that guidance “in due course”, but that he didn’t expect it in “the near future”, saying it may be into 2023 before that change is considered. But he also took the opportunity to urge people who hadn’t yet received a third dose – which he said included 5 million eligible people – to get that booster shot. There are just under 30 minutes until the last QT of the week. There is a week break and then budget estimates will be held while the house sits. November is a little full, actually – three sitting weeks. And the possibility of a fourth being held in the second week of December is a spectre that won’t go away – it is really going to depend on how much legislation gets passed in the Senate in the last two weeks of November. Some more background on that space promise: The Albanese government’s pledge is in line with allies. In April the Biden administration committed “not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing” and it pointed to such tests being done by China and Russia. When the then defence minister Peter Dutton announced the launch of the Australian defence force’s new space command in March, he accused some countries – including Russia – of seeing “space as a territory for their taking”. Dutton cited an anti-satellite missile test in November last year when Russia “destroyed its own redundant Cosmos 1408, which left behind a cloud of more than 1,500 pieces of lethal debris that will take decades to clear”. The new head of Australia’s space command, Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, said in March: The activities by China and Russia, which have been fairly well documented in the public domain, scare me. I think our lack of capability at the moment against those threats … that is concerning. Air Commodore Nicholas Hogan, who joined the space command as the director general of space capability, raised concerns at the time that the lack of established norms or laws in space created a “wild west” scenario. Australian government pledges never to conduct ‘direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing’ The Australian government has announced a promise “to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing”. It says the pledge is “consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space” and it is calling on all nations “to make this commitment as a transparency and confidence building measure”. In a statement issued in the last few minutes, three senior ministers - Penny Wong, Richard Marles and Ed Husic – said: The Australian Government commits to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing, consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space. When carried out, these tests generate large amounts of debris that remain in space for years; threatening satellites and other space objects, and risking the long-term sustainability of human activity in space. The use of these missiles to destroy space objects is reckless, irresponsible and poses threats to space assets of all nations. Australia joins the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea in making this commitment toward a safer, more stable and peaceful space domain. Marles, the defence minister, said the government was making the pledge to demonstrate “Australia’s commitment to act responsibly to protect our national security interests”. Wong, the foreign affairs minister, said the global community “must work together to build a common understanding on rules and norms that can guide how states behave in outer space”. Husic, the minister for industry and science, said: Space technologies support critical services that improve national wellbeing and economic prosperity. This commitment is a responsible step to help ensure space assets are protected for the benefit of all Australians. Queensland police would be immediately dismissed if sentenced to imprisonment under new bill Queensland’s police minister, Mark Ryan, has introduced a bill to allow “the immediate dismissal” of police officers and recruits who are sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal offence. The minister said the legislation would change the current situation where a police officer may be imprisoned but not dismissed from the service until all criminal appeals have ended and a police disciplinary investigation is finalised. “The examples that we have heard during the public hearings of the commission of inquiry are completely unacceptable ... For people who do the wrong thing there is no place for them in the Queensland police service.” The proposed legislation comes after the state’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, conceded the current police disciplinary system is “broken” during an independent commission of inquiry. The inquiry heard a number of officers who had sexually assaulted junior colleagues had not been dealt with appropriately and instead were subjected to “local managerial resolution” – a remedial conversation with a supervisor. Ryan said the application of LMRs is governed by QPS policy and had already been addressed by the police commissioner. However, he said the government will “carefully consider” any recommendations from the commission of inquiry about the police discipline system and “will consult all stakeholders about any need for legislative amendments during this term of government.” The inquiry will hand its final report to the state government on 14 November. Shoot for the moon – worst-case scenario, you land on a piece of SpaceX space junk. About 223,000 Medlab Pathology customers had their personal information including health records, credit card numbers and Medicare numbers exposed in a cyber-attack in February, the company’s parent company, Australian Clinical Labs, has informed the Australian Stock Exchange. Medlab says the breach mostly affects people in NSW and Queensland, and the records exposed of most concern are: 17,539 individual medical and health records associated with a pathology test. 28,286 credit card numbers and individual names. Of these cards, 15,724 have expired, but 3,375 of the cards have the CVV code. 128,608 Medicare numbers and names. Medlab said it became aware of unauthorised third-party access to its system in February, and at the time external forensic specialists did not find evidence that information had been compromised. But in March, the Australian Cyber Security Centre contacted the company and said it had intelligence that Medlab may have been the victim of a ransomware attack. The company again said it did not believe any data was compromised. In June, ACSC contacted the company again to say that it believed Medlab data had been posted on the dark web. Medlab then found and downloaded the data, which the company said was “highly complex and unstructured” and then made attempts to remove it from the dark web permanently. The company has blamed the complexity and unstructured nature of the data for it taking so long to report publicly. NSW farmers and environment groups call for resumption of feral animal culls There are calls for the NSW government to resume culling of feral pests in the state’s national parks over concerns a five-week suspension has put ecosystems at risk. The state government put a temporary suspension in place while it reviewed safety practices after concerns were raised about a deer cull earlier this year in the Kosciuszko national park. That suspension was applied to all culling programs in all parks across the state, prompting concerns from environment groups and the NSW Farmers Association. The Invasive Species Council has called on the government to lift the suspension because the wet weather could lead to “exploding” numbers of feral animals in national parks. The council’s advocacy manager, Jack Gough, said: More feral horses, pigs and deer trashing our parks and adjoining areas will be a disaster for our native wildlife and ecosystems. He said the ban would also be alarming for farmers concerned about “foot and mouth disease preparedness as feral pigs and deer will be major spreaders of the disease if it reaches our shores”. Reg Kidd, a member of the NSW Farmers conservation and resource management committee, told The Sydney Morning Herald “we were flabbergasted to learn the government had put a stop to controlling feral animals in national parks”. He said: Putting a stop to feral animal control is irresponsible as it will impact the public, nature and private landowners such as farmers. The government says the suspension has only affected shooting operations. Other invasive species controls such as baiting and trapping have continued. A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said the agency will “always prioritise public safety” and the review was to ensure operations were being conducted with the highest safety standards. They said completion of the review was imminent and feral animal shooting operations were expected to recommence with “even stronger safety protocols” within the next week. The women’s budget statement event has been held. Mike Bowers was there: NSW and Victoria announce joint funding for $558m redevelopment of Albury Base hospital Tamsin Rose and Benita Kolovos report on what is happening on the border of Vic and NSW: The premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have announced a joint plan to fund a $558m redevelopment of the Albury Base hospital in a bid to improve healthcare for people living in the border region. The announcement, from two leaders on opposite sides of the political aisle who have developed a strong history of collaboration, comes a month out from the Victorian state election and four months ahead of the NSW state poll. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the project served as a “great example of cooperation across political lines” to get results for people in the border region. His Victorian counterpart, Daniel Andrews, added that it was important to ensure community members and healthcare professionals “have the facilities they need”. Premier Perrottet dismissed suggestions that the announcement was a political stunt ahead the state elections both premiers face. He said: Dan and I work closely together. It’s not about politics. It’s about actually getting the job done and working together to achieve great things for our state. The elections are irrelevant. It’s not about that, it’s about our people and being focused on this. Both states will chip in $225m for the redevelopment, in addition to the $108m already allocated by the NSW and commonwealth governments, with construction to begin next year. It is slated to be completed by 2027. Energy ministers prepare to meet in Melbourne As energy ministers prepare to jet into Melbourne (offsetting the carbon, we trust), the various ministers are honing their pitches. As noted in an earlier post, lowering energy prices will be high on the discussion agenda. Since the last such gathering in August, we’ve had some big announcements from Queensland and Victoria (as astutely summarised in this article by Graham Readfearn). Public ownership has certainly loomed larger of late, particularly in Victoria, with its revival of the State Electricity Commission (as we explored here). Queensland’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, also laid out here the benefits of controlling most of the electricity generators and the handy use of a levy on windfall coal profits to give rebates to households. Anyway, de Brenni tells us today that “the best path to secure lower prices is energy independence through more renewable energy”, in comments that probably all of the attending energy ministers will agree on. However, he couldn’t resist a serve at his Coalition counterparts, saying that policy instability over the past decade has been a big part of our present woes. Had the previous federal LNP government delivered a cogent policy to encourage renewables, Australia wouldn’t be so exposed to the volatility of global fossil fuel markets. You could generate more clean energy shuffling your feet down a carpeted hallway than Angus Taylor and the federal LNP delivered in over a decade. And the cheaper medicines bill is also getting through the parliament. Mark Butler will be holding a press conference on that at 12.30 The Senate is pushing through its legislation agenda: And for a temperature check on that, in case you missed it, here is Murph: Chalmers: electricity market not resilient and robust due to ‘decade of policy failures’ Given electricity prices and the $275 savings by 2025 promise will undoubtably feature in Peter Dutton’s budget reply speech, here is what Jim Chalmers had to say about it this morning on ABC Radio RN: I think the full impact of the war in Ukraine is starting to be felt when it comes to electricity prices. We didn’t have these forecasts obviously, which are relatively new forecasts for electricity prices. We didn’t have them in May, of course. But I think people do understand around the community that the war in Ukraine is causing havoc. It’s pushing up electricity prices, and our electricity market here is not as resilient and robust as we need it to be because we’ve had a decade of policy failure. Q: But given the invasion of Ukraine occurred by the May election campaign, shouldn’t Labor have known its modelling was out of date? Chalmers: That’s because it goes to the fundamental fact here – which is renewable energy is not just cleaner energy, it’s also cheaper energy – that is the near unanimous view of investors and economists and others. That remains the case. There’s basically three facts here: first of all, renewable energy is cheaper energy. Secondly, the war in Ukraine is causing havoc and pushing up electricity prices. And, thirdly, the fact that our predecessors had more than 20 energy policies and pulled more capacity out of the system than they put in has made us more vulnerable to these global price shocks. If you haven’t read this yet, you should: Sussan Ley says tax cuts are good and IR reforms are not Sussan Ley, who as the deputy opposition leader has been handed the mantle of chief government attacker (the leaders like to keep their hands mostly clean from political attacks so voters don’t view them as too negative – this is a cross party tactic), says she thinks the industrial relations system is not broken and the stage-three tax cuts will help workers: No, the system is not broken and it’s no excuse to introduce pattern bargaining across this country which allows people in businesses in Western Australia who have a completely unrelated set of circumstances in which they operate their business as employees to somehow be included with businesses and workers on the east coast. It actually doesn’t make any sense at all. In fact, it makes the system more inflexible. What this is, is this government taking industrial relations system back to the 1970s* and not having at its centre productivity in the workplace or a focus on increasing jobs and security for both employees and employers. And you know, what if this government cares about the wages of workers, what it could do is guarantee the stage three tax cuts today, because everyone earning $45,000 or more gets help. The stage three tax cuts will put more money in workers’ pockets** and give them the support that they need when they plan for the future. *That would actually be impossible, given the low union membership, the Fair Work Commission and the fact that the conditions are completely different. We are not in stagflation, company profits have continued upwards, and work conditions are very, very different. **If they earn over $180,000. Sussan Ley says government’s IR legislation will ‘take us back decades’ The Liberal MP is not a fan of the industrial relations bill: Let’s look at the detail, but what this is a rushed introduction of legislation that takes us back decades under the cover of the budget this week. That’s what this is. It could not come at a worse time for businesses who are struggling with staff shortages, who are struggling with increasing costs, for manufacturers they’re looking at power prices that are almost unaffordable. This government does not have their back. This pattern style, industry wide bargaining will increase strike action*. In fact, when asked to guarantee that it wouldn’t this morning on breakfast radio the industrial relations minister couldn’t do that. They also refused to say when it would increase workers’ wages. What this is, is the Labor party looking after the unions, making sure that they keep their promises to their union mates. *In terms of strike action, it pays to put the Australian experience in context – strike action is almost non-existent in this country now. It is at historic lows, along with union membership. Meanwhile, there is still a major focus on health funding – and what will happen when the 50-50 hospital funding deal expires. People living in poverty far more vulnerable to domestic violence, research shows While the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave (to start from next year) is a good start, it is also worth remembering people living in poverty are particularly vulnerable. Last week was Anti-Poverty Week. The Anti-Poverty Week website resources include these facts: New research from the Life Course Centre found young Australian women (aged 21-28 years) in financial hardship are more than 3 times as likely to report being the victim of past-year severe partner abuse: 9.3% compared with 2.9% for those not experiencing financial hardship. The rates were also around double for any partner abuse or unwanted sexual activity. Rates of violence are higher for groups that face multiple forms of discrimination, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women with disability, older women, women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds including women on temporary visas, and those in the LGBTIQA+ community. Women from refugee backgrounds are particularly at risk of financial abuse and reproductive coercion. …and poverty can deter women from leaving Australian Women Against Violence Alliance have estimated that. on average, it costs $18,000 for a victim/survivor to leave a violent relationship and establish safety. This includes costs associated with reallocation, safety upgrades and legal and medical costs Breaking into the political news to update you on the Bruce Lehrmann trial. Chris Knaus reports: The entire jury in the trial of Bruce Lehrmann has been discharged after a juror was found to have conducted their own research and brought outside material into the jury room. The ACT supreme court convened on Thursday morning and heard that a juror had conducted research outside the courtroom, contrary to their oath. Chief justice Lucy McCallum said she had no choice but to discharge one of the 12 jurors. She said that meant she had to discharge them all. Paul Karp is looking through the IR legislation and has found where the conflict will be: Power prices on the agenda when ministers meet on Friday Not the biggest surprise, but energy affordability – along with supply and reliability – will head the agenda for the federal, state and territory ministers when they gather in Melbourne on Friday. Chris Bowen, the federal minister for climate change and energy, told Guardian Australia that work on the National Energy Transformation Partnership aimed at supporting “the smooth transformation of Australia’s energy sector” will also be on the agenda. There’s no mention of the provision of rebates for energy as proposed by NSW’s treasurer Matt Kean, who will be only one of two Liberals in the room. (Guy Barnett should be the other. Along with premier of Tasmania, he has a few hats, including water and veteran affairs...so he must be taking part in federal gatherings every other week.) Bowen’s line is that: “We are now building on this reform program with all jurisdictions to deliver much needed long-term certainty to industry and investors to put downward pressure on prices and ensure reliability of the system.” That pressure is not yet having the desired effect, it should be said. Anyway, as for the size of the power prices rises in the budget, Bowen makes it clear that the first instalment of those 20% and 30% has already taken effect. (The budget wasn’t clear.) “The budget shows that treasury has assumed retail electricity prices have already increased by an average of 20% nationally in 2022-23,” he said. “This largely reflects increases that took effect in the September quarter, including the increase to the Default Market Offer that the former government hid before the election.” If you want to more about that hiding, here’s our story back in May: The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has introduced Labor’s wide-ranging industrial relations bill which improves access to flexible work and removes hurdles to multi-employer bargaining. Burke told the House of Representatives that Australia’s workplace laws “are not up to date”, warning the opposition that, given the cost of living crisis is the gap between incomes and rising prices, they “can’t claim to care about cost of living if [they] support continued wage stagnation”. Burke said that adding gender equity as an object of the Fair Work Act would help close the “unacceptable” gender pay gap of 14.1%, while the bill would remove “insurmountable hurdles” to getting equal pay orders, such as childcare workers who lost a case because they couldn’t fulfil the “impossible task” of finding a male comparator group. Burke said: These reforms are intended to reverse decades of unfair outcomes for women. It will no longer be necessary to establish sex discrimination to prove work has been undervalued.” The bill also contains an “express prohibition” against workplace sexual harassment, and bolsters existing anti-discrimination protections. With curbs on rolling fixed term contracts, the bill will help employees experiencing the “permanent probation period”, he said. The bill’s most controversial changes are to make multi-employer bargaining significantly easier to access, but Burke presented them as incremental changes to existing streams of bargaining. Burke said under existing single-interest bargaining, parties need to get his permission to bargain together, a form of red tape that will be removed. Employers must have clearly identifiable common interests and FWC must be satisfied it is in the public interest,” he said, suggesting the reform will help businesses compete on innovation and service not “who can pay the lowest wage”. Burke also noted consultation is ongoing and didn’t rule out further amendments to better implement safeguards which include guaranteeing that single-employer agreements are still available, and that multi-employer deals are “not extended to those industries where it is not appropriate or not necessary such as commercial construction”. Burke said the bill will give the Fair Work Commission power to resolve “intractable disputes through arbitration” where there is “no prospect” of agreement. This will encourage good faith bargaining and quick resolution of disputes. Agreements signed under the Coalition’s WorkChoices laws will be sunsetted, “businesses need to pay minimum entitlements in awards, to benefit workers and level the playing field”, he said. Changes to the better off overall test will mean the commission uses “actual workers and patterns of work that are foreseeable” to judge a pay deal, taking a “global rather than line by line” approach. If employers and employees agree a pay deal passes the test, the commission will give “primary consideration” to their view. If circumstances change, a pay deal can be reassessed. “This makes sure that no worker will be worse off,” Burke said. And on wages ... There is an event around the woman’s budget statement a little later this morning. Anthony Albanese will deliver a speech at about 10.30am. Big shake up, small turnout in the House as IR bill is introduced Mike Bowers was in the chamber to capture the introduction of legislation for the biggest IR shake up in more than a decade – but most of the opposition was not. Tony Burke commends the bill to the house: This bill delivers on the government’s commitment to ensure a fairer workplace relations system that provides Australians with job security, gender equity and sustainable wage growth. This bill will not fix every problem in our workplace relations system, but it’s a strong start, and it will provide a strong foundation on which we can continue to build a fairer and more equitable system Australians need, want and deserve. Now there will be requests for us to move more slowly, to wait extra months to pretend that there is no urgency as this bill proceeds through the House and in the other place. I asked members and senators to remember how long people have already waited – they have waited a decade, while wages were kept deliberately low. Waited generations while the gender pay gap refused to close, waited while children became adults, while caring responsibilities collided with rosters, waited in insecure work for the secure job, which still hasn’t arrived. These Australians have waited long enough. And while waiting, they have turned up every day and done their job. It’s now time we did ours and legislated for secure jobs and better pay. I commend the build the house. Tony Burke says the IR legislation will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This isn’t new – it was one of Labor’s stated aims since it was introduced. But this line of his speech still gets applause from the government side of the chamber. This bill will abolish the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. The Fair Work Ombudsman will have carriage of all industries. Family violence leave also applies to casuals, Tony Burke says Family and domestic violence paid leave should be in place at most workplaces from 1 February next year, for most employees. Small businesses get an extra six months to adjust to the new workplace entitlement, so it will be August 2023 for those workers. Tony Burke says it also applies to casuals: Family and domestic violence leave has to be a universal entitlement. Women can be victims of domestic violence no matter what job they work, how long they’ve been in that job, what sort of agreement they’re on or how many hours a week they work. In fact, women who are experiencing family and domestic violence are more likely to be employed in casual and insecure work. We can’t leave them behind. Violence doesn’t discriminate – and neither should the law. Greens welcome domestic violence leave but say more funding needed for women’s safety The Greens have welcomed the passing of the family and domestic violence paid leave legislation. But Larissa Waters also pointed out last night that there is no new funding for frontline responses in the budget: Paid Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) leave will help victim-survivors, who are predominantly women, to escape abusive relationships, protect themselves and their children, and rebuild their lives. But paid FDV leave cannot succeed if advice and support services for victim-survivors and employers don’t have funding to meet demand. The long-awaited National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children has now been released, but without any new funding commitments. The women’s safety sector has repeatedly called for a $1B per year investment to ensure funding meets demand. And yet the government’s budget response was to re-badge and re-shuffle previous funding commitments, adding only partial indexation and a fraction of the workers needed, with the Labor government instead choosing tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for donor mates. You can read more about the flexible work component here: As usual, Paul Karp has been all over this What will the industrial relations bill do? Tony Burke’s office is on it – here is part of the release which lays out what the government says this bill will do: The Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill will: - Help close the 14.1 per cent gender pay gap and protect women in the workplace by: putting gender equity at the heart of the Fair Work Commission’s decision-making; boosting the Commission’s gender pay gap expertise; banning pay secrecy clauses; expanding access to flexible work arrangements; and expressly prohibiting sexual harassment in the Fair Work Act. - Improve job security by placing new limits on rolling fixed term contracts so workers can’t be effectively put on an endless probation period. - Protect workers by: bolstering their ability to recover unpaid entitlements under the Fair Work small claims system; banning job ads that advertise for below the relevant minimum pay rate; and closing a loophole to protect firefighters in the ACT. - Return fairness to the workplace by abolishing the politicised, discredited and unnecessary Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission. -Modernise the bargaining system by expanding access to enterprise bargaining and multi-employer bargaining; reforming the Better Off Overall Test so it’s simple, flexible and fair; making it easier to initiate bargaining; giving the Fair Work Commission new powers to resolve long-running intractable disputes; and terminating WorkChoices-era “zombie” agreements. IR bill will improve gender equality and help stop sexual harassment, Burke says In the chamber, Tony Burke says with this IR bill, all the Respect at Work report legislative recommendations are now before the parliament. Workers who want to have a discussion about pay equity at work should not be prohibited by their employment contracts when doing so. This bill will prohibit pay secrecy clauses bringing transparency to workplaces critically, this bill protects workers by saying if you want to tell people how much you are paid that is up to you. Stamping out workplace sexual harassment is central to achieving safe, productive and gender equitable workplaces. Under the previous government’s laws, there was no express prohibition on sexual harassment under the Fair Work Act and stopped sexual harassment orders were only available to some workers. We will fix these issues. Our changes mean whether you’re a nurse in Tamworth, a plumber in Perth or an office worker in Canberra, you can ask the Fair Work Commission to deal quickly and effectively with your complaint of sexual harassment in the Fair Work Commission. Whether the harassment occurred in the past or is ongoing or both. The new provisions will also allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate and assist with compliance. These changes send a clear message that workplace sexual harassment will not be tolerated. These reforms fully implement recommendation 28 of the respect at work report, complementing the attorney general’s proposed reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act. This bill means that all legislative changes recommended by respect at work are now before the parliament. Burke says IR bill won’t create more industrial action from workers Tony Burke was pressed this morning on whether multi-employer bargaining would lead to more industrial action. He was asked by Patricia Karvelas: “The big concern from business groups is that this will lead to a lot more industrial action. Is that ultimately where this will end?” Burke: Australia has low rates of industrial action, and that won’t change. That won’t change. Karvelas: But this opens the door to it changing? Burke: Well, no, no, no. Because you can already have industrial action on a single-employer agreement. What we are doing, though – and I think what has really frustrated people – is that when you get this long, protracted industrial action, including in single employer agreements, at the moment those long disputes have no way of being resolved. And we’re introducing, when the commission believes it has become intractable, that you can now have arbitration where they look at – ‘OK, here are the issues that have been agreed. Here are the issues that haven’t been agreed. Let’s sort it out.’ And that way the long, protracted, neverending disputes, which are often the ones in the media, they should become much less common. I’m hoping they become a thing of the past. Karvelas: Okay, but clearly though you’re saying, you know, we have low industrial action, and that’s right. This allows for industrial action across workplaces, does it not? That is the ultimate consequence of this bill. Burke: That’s right, but the rules in being able to do it are no different to what they would be if you were doing a single-employer negotiation. Karvelas: Sure, but all of a sudden you have a lot more workers striking potentially. Burke: Look, there are lots of forms of industrial action and lots of them much more lowkey than that. The big difference here – well, first of all, before any industrial action – even single – at the moment you can go – you go straight to it after you’ve had your vote of workers. There’ll now be compulsory conciliation to try to sort these disputes out. That may of itself across the board put real downward pressure on industrial action because we get issues solved first. And then if they’re continuing arbitration, which has not been there before, becomes available. It’s a much more sensible outcome. A crucial review of the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) is expected to make recommendations to the Albanese government well before it hands down its final report next year. The review, to be led by chair Bruce Bonyhady and experienced public servant Lisa Paul, is shaping up as pivotal to the future of the scheme and the hundreds of thousands of participants who rely on it, following Tuesday’s budget forecasts. The government also announced a major crackdown on NDIS fraud in the budget, tipped to rake in about $200m, but it has acknowledged the review is looking into reform of the scheme, including to make it more “sustainable”. The budget forecast the total cost of federal, state and territory funding for the NDIS is expected to increase from $35bn this year to $52bn in 2025-26, an $8.8bn increase compared to the figures in the May budget. Queensland’s disability services minister, Craig Crawford, told Guardian Australia disability ministers were “all concerned about the fiscal risk in the projected funding for NDIS over coming years”. “But the cost blowouts need to be managed without stopping new entrants coming onto the scheme that deserve to be there. “Queensland also welcomes the crackdown on fraud and cowboy operators.” The NSW disability services minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, told Guardian Australia fraud in the scheme was a “significant concern” and the disability ministers agreed “more needs to be done in this space”. “The NSW Government will continue to work with the Commonwealth and other states and territories to ensure that the NDIS is sustainable and delivers as intended for people with disability.” A Victorian government spokesperson told Guardian Australia the review was an “important opportunity to examine key issues underlying the scheme to ensure it operates as originally intended”. Disability groups warned discussion around cost must also consider the social and economic benefits, pointing to a Per Capita report which found every $1 spent on the scheme spurned $2.25 in economic activity. Ross Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, told Guardian Australia the funds provided to NDIS participants were not “squirrelled away” by people with disability. “They are putting money back into the economy to pay for the supports they need to live an ordinary life,” he said. Joyce also argued the NDIS was saving money in other areas such as health and mental health, but those savings were not easily calculated. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is now introducing the industrial relations bill. He says Australia’s IR system is no longer working and it is beyond time to change it. But he says this bill, if passed, won’t be able to solve issues like wage growth overnight. Australians have asked for change. They’ve asked for less conflict and fairer pay. They’ve asked for a better future for themselves and for their families. It will take time for this bill to result in improvements in workplaces and pay increases in the pockets of Australians. So we cannot waste a moment in passing it. The family and domestic violence leave bill is passed on the voices. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. There is applause in the house. The plan for parliament today The parliament is sitting. Tony Burke is up and he is laying out the day’s business. Peter Dutton gets the budget reply this evening (about 7.30pm). And it looks like the family and domestic violence leave is one of the first issues of the House (the Senate sat late last night to pass it). So it is back in the house for the amendments to be passed. (The amendments are agreed to by the government, so this will be quick) After that, we are going straight into industrial relations. Ley says Morrison government handed over ‘strong economy’ and Labor ‘haven’t got a plan’ Sussan Ley was very critical of the government’s budget on Sky News this morning and was asked what she believed the answers were. She said: Well, we aren’t the government, we handed the government a strong economy. In fact, Jim Chalmers said, when we handed down our budget ‘what we need is a plan to tackle the sting of inflation’. So where is his plan? What’s he doing? Where is the reassurance that Australians need that things will start to get better? They will only feel that if they know this government has a plan. Now, in terms of what to do, Pete, there are many things. We made affordable power prices a priority when we were in government. We understood that that’s the perspective that you have to have when you look at this issue, so that we don’t find that people can’t afford to turn on the coolers, or turn on the heaters, or run their manufacturing equipment in their businesses. Now, that’s not the approach this government has had. They’ve talked to the game on renewables, but they haven’t realised the cost. They haven’t realised, for example, that more supply into the market makes sense. They haven’t got a plan. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi will give notice of a private senator’s bill she will introduce today aiming to halt the indexation on student loans and increase the repayment threshold to above the median wage. Faruqi says it is one way which would help ease the cost of living burden on people with student debt: Student debt is no small problem. About three million people in Australia have the burden of student debt. At a time when the cost of living is biting hard, governments can no longer ignore the student debt crisis and its impacts. Study debts are impacting people’s ability to obtain loans, their mental health, their ability to save up to buy a home or simply afford to live a good life. Scrapping indexation on HELP debts and raising the minimum repayment threshold will provide much needed money in people’s pockets to make ends meet or pay rent. Faruqi says higher education should be free and this legislation is one step in that direction and has challenged the Labor government to work with the Greens “to wind back Liberal era policies which have saddled people with more debt that takes longer and longer to pay off”. And this is what Jennifer Westacott, the head of Business Council, had to say about industrial relations in an interview with Ausbiz yesterday: What we have said all the time is that we want wages to grow, and we want them to stay growing. Not to have a short-term growth and then have at the expense of potentially higher unemployment. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is we’ve got to get an IR system that drives productivity. That’s not about working harder for less, it’s about working smarter. It’s about creating the environment where people use new technology, where they innovate, where they share ideas, where they open new markets, where they have more skilled people. It’s about creating value by doing things differently. That requires a collaborative workplace at an enterprise level. We want to see the enterprise bargaining system revitalised. What we don’t want to see is more complexity. What we don’t want to see is industry-wide bargaining, which we think will really hurt productivity, and in the long term, hurt wages growth. What we don’t want to see is widespread industrial action. We hear a lot of the unions saying what we want out of this reform is the capacity for widespread industrial action. The community doesn’t want that and our economy is too fragile, to really take rolling strikes like we had in 1983. So that’s IR. Then we’ve really got to have a mature conversation about tax reform. We try to do this in this country, every time we do, someone shuts it down, and we never make any progress. The simple reality is we’ve got a spending and a revenue problem. The third thing we have to do, which is not a matter for business, but the matter for government, but it’s hugely important, is control spending in those areas like NDIS. Control spending in health, not by cutting costs, but by getting better outcomes. That’s going to require investment in technology, workforce, and so on. We’ve got to be willing to tackle red tape and the micro-economic reform that needs to be done, that gets rid of all the friction in the economy. We’ve got to stay on course for the migration targets that we welcome in the budget last night. So, there’s a lot of stuff to do. To be honest, we can’t wait for the May budget to get on with some of it but get on with it we have to. Because we’re looking around the world and you’ve just been reporting on this. You’ve got the UK in a political and economic crisis. What does that mean? Well, it means tough times for people living in the UK. We don’t want that for Australians. It is fair to say that business is not too happy with multi-employer bargaining. Or that they are yet to see the industrial relations bill. The warnings that people will lose their jobs have already begun. But on the flip side, wages haven’t increased in about a decade, union membership has fallen and the idea we might see the wildcat strikes of the 1970s given the Fair Work hoops seems wildly over inflated. Here is what Sally McManus has to say about it. She told the ABC: At the moment we’ve got a situation where the wages are moving for CEOs. They went up 40% this year . Productivity, labour productivity has gone up 13% and workers have seen less than 1% of that. Clearly there’s a problem at the moment. Like when the economy is good, workers don’t get pay rises. When the economy is bad, it’s the same thing. So, I mean, clearly there’s a big problem in terms of the underlying structure of our bargaining system and that’s what we’ve got to fix. If we’ve people on a more equal footing you get better outcomes, it’s a pretty straightforward solution to it by doing that. We like to see more co-operation in the country. We would like to see businesses recognising they can’t have their employees, the workers of this country, the people who spend in small businesses, in a situation where wages have been held down for so long and unfairly. Meanwhile, Murph has a reality check on how we ended up where we have with energy prices. In the Senate yesterday, Greens senator Lidia Thorpe spoke about the death of 15-year-old Noongar boy Cassius Turvey, who was killed as he walked home from school. A man has been charged, but police investigations are continuing. Today I rise for a 15-year-old First Nations child, Cassius Turvey. Cassius Turvey was a loved member of the Noongar community who ran his own lawn-mowing business and would let community members decide how much they could pay him. On 13 October, Cassius was returning home from school when he allegedly was viciously beaten with a pole. He passed away eight days later. When a First Nations child is born, they inherit and learn cultural wisdom, knowledge and strength. Our families gather and we wrap our arms around our babies, knowing that they’re our dreaming children. Their blood line is their birthright. This is our children’s land. It is their country, and they’re guided by our ancestors. If only it were a reality that our children could live out their birthright in this country; that they would live a journey of peace, culturally and spiritually safe. No Aboriginal child should be robbed of their birthright in so-called Australia. Our Dreaming child, Cassius, fell victim to a monster—a monster far greater than those who (allegedly) racially targeted and killed Cassius. The monster is the unresolved violent legacy of white Australia. To Cassius’s family, friends and community: I’m sorry. To black Australia: I’m sorry. I am sorry that we are here again with yet another justice hashtag for the loss of another black life. No black child should fear walking home from school and no black mother should wonder if their child will return home. We all must fight for a country where First Nations children like Cassius can live out their birthright. Cassius: may you rest as we rise and continue the fight. Rod Sims thinks Labor should threaten gas companies with export limits No one in the government is saying yet what they will be doing about energy prices, but the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head has waded in with some thoughts: “Has anyone wrangled a camel before?” a member of the Foxtrot One in-water rescue team asks apprehensively from the boat. “Ah, it’s domesticated,” another member, Anthony Walgate, reassures him. Fire and Rescue NSW yesterday afternoon carried out a “humpday” operation to rescue a domesticated camel stranded in floodwaters of the Murray River near Moama. The emergency authority said: Gina the domestic camel had wandered off from her small herd on the property towards the river, ignoring repeated attempts by her owner to coax her away from the water’s edge. The local resident was concerned because camels cannot swim Wading through the river up to their chests, the specially-trained rescue technicians used hay to lure Gina out of the floodwater and back to dry land. She was soon returned to the herd unharmed. For the Fire and Rescue NSW crew, their ‘dromedary’ drama was done and dusted. These firefighters adding ‘Camel Wrangling’ to their long list of rescue capabilities. The defence minister Richard Marles is speaking about Australian troops being sent to help train Ukraine forces. Daniel Hurst has you covered on that. Chalmers slip up – after a question he says he misheard – makes headlines Jim Chalmers is still doing the media rounds and he’s sounding a little tired. Yesterday he made his first misstep – he misheard a question at the press club about whether Labor stood by its $275 lower power bills election promise and the treasurer said yup, it’s in the budget. In question time he said he had contacted the journalist who asked it immediately after to say he misheard the question and thought he had been asking something else. His mistake is the front page of the Daily Telegraph today. But the focus is what is the government going to do to lower electricity prices. Chalmers said he isn’t going to pre-empt what the government’s consultation brings, but intervention into the market is one of the things under consideration. Happy budget reply day to those who celebrate. Peter Dutton will deliver his first budget reply speech at about 7.30pm (the same time the treasurer delivered his on Tuesday) where the opposition will lay out its plan to deal with Australia’s cost of living issues. Although you’ll probably hear a lot about the government’s lack of a plan, based on the criticisms from the opposition so far. But before then, the parliament has to get through a busy day of trying to pass as much legislation as possible, given there are only a handful of sitting weeks left until the end of the year. The Senate agreed to sit later last night so there might be a few cranky heads in the red chamber this morning. The main legislative game today will be the introduction of the government’s industrial relations bill, where a fight is looming over multi-employer bargaining. It’s a fight Tony Burke seems to be itching to have, and part of a plan to try to lift wages across the country. The bill is also aiming for more flexible work options for people who might need it. It’s a pretty big shake up of the industrial system and business is not on board for all of it. Neither is the opposition. Hence the brewing fight. And of course, there is also energy and what the government is going to do about future price increases. After yesterday’s inflation numbers and treasury’s forecasts, people want answers. We’ll bring you all of it as it happens. You have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst leading the way and Mike Bowers taking you into the hallways and chambers. Amy Remeikis will be on the blog for most of the day. I’ve already had three coffees and don’t know what today will bring. Maybe a cupcake for breakfast. It seems necessary. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T08:29:45Z","webTitle":"Australia will put nuclear safety ‘above all else’ as it builds submarines, vice admiral says ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia will put nuclear safety “above all else” as it begins the “generational challenge” of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. V Adm Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Mead said there were likely to be more Australians onboard British and American nuclear-powered submarines as part of the training process. He said as many as 40 Australians may potentially be onboard a US submarine at any one time. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to welcome the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the British PM, Rishi Sunak, to the US for a joint announcement early next week about the practicalities of Australia acquiring at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mead, who leads a taskforce of more than 350 Australian officials who have been working on the plans, said this would be “a generational challenge for Australia and will probably redefine Australia’s strategic personality”. But he sought to reassure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific about Australia’s intentions. “I can give them a commitment that we will hold the standards of safety above all else,” Mead said on Wednesday. “Look at the track record of US and UK nuclear submarines previously, look at Australia’s own track record in the way we manage our research reactor at Lucas Heights, and the way that we have managed visiting nuclear-powered ships and submarines over the past 60 years.” Mead described nuclear safety as “the No 1 consideration as we build, operate, maintain and regulate the nuclear powered submarines”. This would include safety of the submarine crew, safety of the community, and environmental protection. He said Australia had received “a very clear message from the US and the UK that safety is paramount” but added: “I think the Australian people would absolutely expect that, so we’re going to make sure that we set a gold standard when it comes to safety.” ‘Welded, shielded and sealed’ for 33 years Some nuclear experts have argued the Aukus arrangement depends on “a glaring and worrying loophole” in safeguards that could be exploited by others. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) does not ban non-nuclear weapon countries such as Australia from having nuclear-powered naval vessels. The Chinese government has also sought to sow doubt about Aukus, arguing the deal would have “a grave nuclear proliferation risk and violates the object and purpose of the NPT”. But Mead said each nuclear reactor would “come to us welded, shielded and sealed” and Australia was in continuing dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency. He said they were making “excellent progress” on an inspection and verification regime, while acknowledging the need “to protect very sensitive technology of the US and UK”. “Nuclear-powered submarines are not prohibited under the NPT,” Mead said. “Yes, the reactors will be with highly enriched uranium. But once again, they are welded, shielded and sealed for the life of the reactor. That’s 33 years. “We will implement the most stringent of security protocols to make sure that those reactors are not opened for the life of the submarine.” Sovereign control Mead was tight-lipped about the design of the submarine, the timeframes and the cost – all of which will be announced soon. But he again defended the plans against concerns raised by former prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating over their potential impact on Australian sovereignty. “When we take our own sovereign control, we will clearly have some US and UK sailors there – and they may be there to provide technical advice on the reactor, or they may be upfront working with us in the combat system,” Mead said. “We welcome that technical advice, we welcome subject matter expertise. And I think that we will continue to have US and UK people in our submarines, as we will have our own people onboard their submarines.” But Mead said such arrangements would not inhibit Australian command and control. “It doesn’t matter who is onboard. If that is an Australian flagged submarine with an Australian commanding officer, there is absolutely no ambiguity when it comes to sovereign control,” he said. Asked what would happen if that technical advice was withdrawn, Mead said Australia was determined to “develop a sovereign ability to build a nuclear-powered submarine, operate a nuclear-powered submarine, maintain a nuclear-powered submarine and regulate a nuclear-powered submarine”. “So there’s an expectation by our partners, and I think Australians would have an expectation, that we must be able to do this ourselves,” Mead said. “But yes, we will have assistance, something we have assistance with many of our major programs. The US and the UK will assist us and as we develop more and more understanding of the technology, then we would be probably have less of those people in Australia.” Mead said the looming announcement would show that the plans were “really a trilateral partnership” with the US and the UK, rather than a binary choice. He said his taskforce was working closely with the South Australian government and unions to develop a supply chain and vendor base in Australia that could feed into US and UK programs. On Wednesday the British high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, rebuked the Australian opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for saying the government should pursue US Virginia class submarines over a British alternative. Treadell said she had spoken with Dutton and told him he was “commenting on an outcome he doesn’t yet know”. She told the National Press Club: “I was simply pointing out that I did not think such expressions were helpful on what is a genuine trilateral partnership started under his government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"US debt ceiling: Republican hard-right vows to ‘do everything in our power’ to oppose bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","fields":{"bodyText":"Members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus have attacked the proposed spending cuts in the debt ceiling bill as woefully inadequate, and vowed to oppose the legislation when it hits the floor. “We had the time to act, and this deal fails – fails completely,” Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, chair of the Freedom Caucus, said on Tuesday. “We will do everything in our power to stop it and end it now.” The House is expected to hold a final vote on the bill on Wednesday, while other members of the Freedom Caucus continue to denounce the compromise brokered by the Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and President Joe Biden over the weekend. The compromise bill, formally named the Fiscal Responsibility Act, would suspend the debt ceiling until 2025, allowing the US to avoid a default that could reap devastating consequences on the American economy. The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned that the federal government will be unable to pay its bills starting on 5 June unless Congress takes action. In addition to the debt ceiling suspension, the bill includes government spending cuts and expanded work requirements demanded by McCarthy. “There has been a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights that have gone into changing the spending trajectory in this town,” Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday night. “For once in a long, long time, Washington is actually going to spend less money next year than it is this year, and that’s a reform that all of us can support.” Republicans on the House rules committee voted late on Tuesday to advance the bill, clearing the way for a final vote on Wednesday. During that hearing, two Freedom Caucus members who sit on the panel, Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, attempted to block the legislation from advancing, but they were outnumbered by their colleagues. The final vote in the rules committee was 7-6 to advance the bill, with four Democrats joining Roy and Norman in opposing the measure. “The Republican conference right now has been torn asunder,” Roy said ahead of the hearing. “Not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal.” But the Republican chair of the rules committee, Tom Cole of Oklahoma, defended the bill as the party’s best possible option with Democrats in control of the White House and the Senate. “Today’s bill is a product of compromise that reflects the realities of a divided government,” Cole said at the hearing. “In a true negotiation, you always get less than you want and give up more than you’d like.” Despite reassurances from McCarthy and his allies, it remains unclear how many House Republicans will support the proposal. In addition to the Freedom Caucus, some of the more centrist members of the House Republican conference like representatives Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Wesley Hunt of Texas said they would vote against the bill. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, a member of the Freedom Caucus, predicted that most of the House Republican conference would oppose the legislation, forcing McCarthy to rely on Democrats to pass the bill. “This is a career-defining vote for every Republican,” Bishop said Tuesday. “This bill, if it passes, must pass with less than half of the Republican conference.” The House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, underscored the reality that Republicans must provide most of the 218 votes needed to get the bill approved. “This is an agreement that, at their insistence, they negotiated with the administration,” Jeffries said. “It’s our full and complete expectation that they are going to produce at least 150 votes.” Some House Democrats also appeared conflicted over the compromise measure on Tuesday, bemoaning the proposed spending cuts while emphasizing the crucial need to increase the government’s borrowing limit before 5 June. “There are some pros to the bill. The chief one is that it raises the debt limit to 2025 and ensures that we avoid a Republican-led catastrophic default,” Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on Tuesday. “I don’t want to minimize the challenges with the bill. There will be real harmful impacts for poor people and working people,” she added. Jayapal said her team was in the process of conducting a whip count to assess where progressive members stand on the debt ceiling bill, but it appears certain that the legislation will win bipartisan support in the House, as the center-left New Democrat Coalition has endorsed the proposal. If the bill passes the House, it will move on to the Senate, where lawmakers will have only a few days to approve the proposal before the 5 June default deadline. Even if McCarthy’s compromise can become law, the speaker’s troubles may be just beginning. Members of the Freedom Caucus, some of whom initially resisted McCarthy’s speakership bid in January, toyed with the idea of ousting him depending on the outcome of Wednesday’s vote. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida told Newsmax on Tuesday, “If a majority of Republicans are against a piece of legislation, and you use Democrats to pass it, that would immediately be a black-letter violation of the deal we had with McCarthy to allow his ascent to the speakership, and it would likely trigger an immediate motion to vacate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T00:05:10Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is back in the game, but remains a distant prospect for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Compared to some of his pet projects – the bridge across the Irish Sea or a floating airport in the Thames – Boris Johnson’s plan to get 25% of UK electricity from nuclear power plants by 2050 isn’t all that fanciful. The same mark was reached within living memory, after the commissioning of Sizewell B in 1995. If the climate crisis weren’t reason enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has crystallised the case for any energy technology that allows us to eschew fossil fuels supplied by foreign despots. This week, the prime minister is expected to outline his plan to make the UK more energy self-sufficient, with nuclear likely to be a key component. Charging at full pelt towards a nuclear future is far from straightforward, though, if history is anything to go by. Even when the UK did produce a quarter of its electricity from nukes, the journey there was long and bumpy. Sizewell B was hooked up to the national grid in 1995, but it was first announced in 1969, with spades only breaking ground in 1986. More recently, the industry has been in steady decline. Since that mid-90s peak, capacity has fallen from nearly 13GW to 6.8GW, about 16-18% of the electricity mix. Hunterston B retired this year, Hinkley Point B bows out this summer and by the time Hartlepool I and Heysham I come off grid in 2024, nuclear capacity will have fallen to a paltry 3.6GW, a mere 5-6% of what you’d need at 6pm on a cold weekday in winter. Hinkley Point C is due to recoup 3.2GW of lost ground but only by 2027, assuming no fresh delays. It is not nearly enough to get close to Johnson’s target. That will require the successful execution of nearly every nuclear project to have been mooted in recent years, including some that have struggled to get going so far. It would probably mean extending the life of Sizewell B and giving the go-ahead for Sizewell C, which stalled when the government got cold feet about Chinese involvement. Wylfa on Anglesey, paused after Japanese firm Hitachi pulled out in 2020 citing lack of government investment, would need to be thrown into the mix. Factor in, too, Rolls-Royce’s “mini-nuke” small reactors, which have state backing but carry the risk of novelty. Some of the GE Hitachi partnership’s own small reactors might need to be included too. All of that gets you to about 15GW, likely to fall below 25% of demand in 2050, once you consider that the drive towards net zero will involve significant electrification, of home heating and vehicles, in order to decarbonise. Some in the nuclear industry are daring to breathe the names of semi-mythical locations such as Oldbury and Moorside, where large-scale nuclear projects were abandoned but could be raised from their slumber. The government, previously cordial but cool towards nuclear, appears to be warming to such ideas, minds focused by sky-high fossil fuel prices. As Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, says: “It has reminded people why a significant reliance on something traded internationally [oil and gas] isn’t a good place to be.” There are fences to jump. Financing problems have put paid to major projects in the past. The Treasury still hasn’t rubber-stamped proposals for a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model, which could spur private investment by transferring some of the risk of multibillion-pound projects to the taxpayer. The UK must also resolve the “taxonomy” issue, already sorted in the EU, which determines whether nuclear is suitable for investment funds using environmental and social criteria. There is also a question mark over the number of skilled engineers available, particularly if the nuclear push is replicated across Europe. But George Borovas, head of the nuclear practice at global law firm Hunton Andrew’s Kurth, believes the UK is among the best-placed countries in the world to go nuclear. “The UK has done the preliminary work, it’s done the site evaluation, it has a sophisticated regulator, good heavy industry and an existing fleet. I’ve always thought the UK was a great place for new nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/20/snp-in-shock-a-party-that-surged-to-power-but-forgot-about-self-governance","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"SNP in shock: a party that surged to power but forgot about self-governance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/20/snp-in-shock-a-party-that-surged-to-power-but-forgot-about-self-governance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/20/snp-in-shock-a-party-that-surged-to-power-but-forgot-about-self-governance","fields":{"bodyText":"The first day back at Holyrood after Easter recess should have been the moment for Scotland’s new leader, Humza Yousaf, to reset the agenda after a bruising leadership contest. Instead, hours before his first big policy statement on Tuesday, Yousaf found himself besieged by reporters asking questions about the arrest of the SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie, earlier that morning, and having to insist that while Beattie’s arrest was a “very serious matter”, people were “innocent until proven guilty”. The clamour was further evidence of a Scottish National party in chaos. Just two weeks earlier, its former chief executive Peter Murrell – the husband of Yousaf’s predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon – had also been arrested, with police dramatically raiding the couple’s home and erecting a tent to gather evidence in the garden. The arrests are part of a police inquiry into the SNP’s handling of more than £600,000 in donations raised to campaign for a second independence referendum, but allegedly used for day-to-day running costs instead. It is no repeat of the Westminster MPs’ expenses scandal, but the criminal allegations still raise the prospect of financial wrongdoing. Now MSPs, activists and officials are asking soul-searching questions, many of which boil down to: how could a national party, leading Scotland’s battle for independence from the UK, have been allowed to descend into such turmoil? “Some people are still in shock, some are in denial, some are saying ‘what the fuck?’” says one senior politician representing the north of Scotland. Speaking to a wide range of elected representatives, activists and officials, almost all refer to the explosion in membership that took place immediately after Scotland’s first independence referendum of 2014 as the pivot point for a party where governance – as one ex-minister put it – “became nonexistent”. “The party depended on the old mechanisms for too long and that’s why we are in deep shit,” says a former national executive committee member bluntly. Despite being in government at Holyrood since 2007, it was the influx of energised Yes voters that turned the party – which was still led by people who could remember being spat at in the street while leafletting – into a popular, mass-membership organisation that other Scottish parties feared and admired. As one senior official who worked closely with Sturgeon accepted: “We should have modernised, and we never really changed the governance to accommodate the membership post 2014. Yes there was a lack of transparency and accountability, but it’s unfair to pin everything on one person. Everyone needs to take a long hard look at themselves.” A number of sources describe a kind of institutional stasis, as the party bounced from election campaign to massive conference venue: glossy, controlled and hugely successful in public, but behind the scenes never having time to do more than triage or, increasingly, ignore longer-term issues. Repeatedly, SNP insiders point out that much of the work was done by volunteers with other responsibilities. “Restructuring takes a lot of energy, as does arranging two conferences a year and running eight election campaigns, with a small HQ team. People still don’t appreciate how difficult it was running a party during Covid. People were exhausted.” Many describe an almost passive acceptance of the highly unusual situation of having a married couple at the very top of the party. Murrell had established his reputation in transforming the party’s electoral prospects while his wife was still deputy leader, and “it didn’t seem to be a problem” when she then took over from Alex Salmond as leader and first minister. “Scottish politics is a small world,” says one veteran activist who has worked with both. But what it amounted to was a blurring of the lines between party and government. As one former MP with experience of both Salmond and Sturgeon’s leadership explains: “When we went into government in 2007, nobody had ever run anything. The lines between party and government got blurred and increasingly party machinery was co-opted into running the FM [first minister]. “After 2014 we lacked the experience and ability to run a large national party,” they add. “The leadership team were very inexperienced in handling internal democracy on that scale and increasingly steamrollered over reasonable challenge. Nobody seemed to realise there would be a mighty explosion at some point.” While the willingness to speak about it in public is certainly new, frustrations among the rank and file membership about the behaviour of the SNP leadership go back years, as do attempts to change it. That’s one of the reasons why such a substantial portion of members voted for Kate Forbes, who was narrowly beaten by Yousaf in the leadership contest, suggests another senior party figure. “They were pissed off with HQ, with emails not answered, complaints not dealt with, and above all the complacency.” Another senior official suggests that MSPs and MPs who largely endorsed Yousaf for leadership ignore this at their peril: “The split between the parliamentarians and the membership could end up being a more fundamental issue to the party’s future than the finances.” The clamour for party reform that started during the leadership contest is now deafening, but recent revelations have also galvanised some members. One central belt MSP explains: “Party members have been upset, baffled, shocked, hurt, but there’s also a new confidence in asking questions and demanding transparency from the party. They’re thinking about how to move forward, how to re-engage the people we need to, and at branch level, members are saying ‘let’s get out there, get the new leaflets ready’. There’s nothing they can do about the ongoing revelations, but they can affect what’s happening in their own constituency.” As one former minister who served with Sturgeon puts it: “The trump card was always: ‘Do you really want to do that to the boss?’ It was based on respect and trust, and a discipline based on loyalty.” So what does it mean for Yousaf, leading a party in which the internal critics are unleashed? Forbes and her campaign team have already formed a backbench group focusing on the economy, and other MSPs point to the “energy and experience” on the backbenches. “It depends if Humza is true to his word about being open to new ideas and input from beyond the inner circle,” says one. Many members note a change in tone from Yousaf. Over the Easter recess, and even with the physical demands of Ramadan fasting (Yousaf is a practising Muslim), they admire his visibility, inviting the media to Bute House for a “fireside” briefing, campaigning at weekends with activists, and emailing party members to reassure them soon after Murrell’s arrest. As one senior MSP put it: “What a difference – actually acknowledging there’s a problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T11:00:49Z","webTitle":"‘They are the crucial buyers’: theatres tap into the power of female readers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","fields":{"bodyText":"Female readers are the acknowledged force behind the market in published fiction. Their collective response to a book has decided the fate of many a novelist. And when the book groups of Britain get behind a new title, it makes a big difference to its fortunes. Now canny theatre producers are harnessing that commercial power with a string of new stage shows based on hit books by female authors that were also enjoyed largely by female readers. Waiting in the wings this spring are plays or musicals based on bestsellers that include Hamnet, The Time Traveler’s Wife and The Suspicions of Mr Whicher. While each book is different in tone, they share a ready-made contingent of devoted fans – not all women, of course, but they dominate the fanbase. And even those theatregoers who have not read them yet will at least have heard of some of the titles. “It’s fair to say that women are the drivers of the fiction market – certainly they are the crucial buyers,” said novelist Kate Griffin. Her own gothic drama, Fyneshade, out next month, has been hailed as ripe for stage adaptation in enthusiastic early reviews. “If you look at the covers in a bookshop, you’ll see that so many are gorgeously designed to have an aesthetic and perhaps a specifically female appeal,” said Griffin. “It’s not surprising there’s now a crossover with theatre.” First in front of audiences was the stage version of Hanya Yanagihara’s cult novel A Little Life, which opened in London last week. The original, divisive book made the Booker prize shortlist in 2015 and is still revered by many. In this production, directed by the maverick Belgian Ivo van Hove, the actor James Norton, who plays the central character, Jude, disrobes. “It’s interesting to see [the trend] is happening as female artistic directors and producers are starting to call more shots,” said Griffin. “It’s natural that the choices they make, in terms of commissioning and themes, are filtering through. Having said that, I suspect a key appeal of A Little Life for many women theatregoers might be James Norton getting his kit off!” Hamnet, Maggie O’Farrell’s acclaimed recent novel, is also poised for a glittering transition to the theatre this month. A stage adaptation written by Lolita Chakrabarti for the Royal Shakespeare Company has already secured a West End run at the Garrick theatre this September before it has even made its premiere in Stratford-upon-Avon, where tickets have all but disappeared. The show, which officially opens on Wednesday, stars Madeleine Mantock as Shakespeare’s wife. Like the book, which has sold 1.5m copies worldwide, it centres on her grief at the death of their only son, Hamnet, and speculates on its impact on the playwright’s later work. “Hamnet – a beautiful book in every way – was hugely popular with reading groups, often largely female, and there’s clearly an appetite for these much-loved books to be adapted for stage,” said Griffin. “In my – admittedly subjective – experience, women are also usually the buyers of theatre tickets. So, when something like Hamnet comes to the stage, there’s already a receptive audience.” The co-producers of the stage show, Neal Street, are also behind a new film version of O’Farrell’s book, to be directed by the Oscar winner Chloé Zhao. There is, Griffin suspects, a completist urge among many serious fans of popular novels that will lead them to buy both theatre and cinema tickets, just as they have collected different print editions. Dave Stewart, once of the Eurythmics, will be hoping the same holds true for his new musical, The Time Traveller’s Wife, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger’s 2003 fantasy. Stewart has written the songs for the show, with the singer Joss Stone as his lyricist. The script, by Lauren Gunderson, will tell of the unconventional romance between a time traveller and a sculptor called Clare. Already the subject of a film and a TV series, the book’s stage version opens this autumn at the Apollo theatre in London’s West End. The many fans of the gripping 2008 bestseller The Suspicions of Mr Whicher by Kate Summerscale will only have to wait until May, when the fact-based murder story, set in 1860, comes to the Watermill theatre in Berkshire. Adapted by Alexandra Wood, it will pit Jonathan Whicher, the celebrated Scotland Yard detective, against a perplexing and grim country house mystery. And the literary-theatrical trend, which arguably started with the RSC’s staging of Hilary Mantel’s hit Wolf Hall series in 2014, looks set to continue, with Annie Proulx’s influential 1997 story Brokeback Mountain also being developed for the stage. The new stream of women’s fiction now supplying our stages follows a tide of recent productions based on well-known screen stories. The majority of these shows, such as Back to the Future, Moulin Rouge!, The Great British Bake Off Musical, Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing, have used popular films or TV series as their source material. Forthcoming productions to do the same include a return for Tim Minchin’s version of Groundhog Day and a new play based on the sci-fi drama Stranger Things. A version of the Robin Williams film comedy Mrs Doubtfire is also on the way to the UK in musical form, although this show surely belongs in the women’s fiction category too, since the original 1987 book, Madame Doubtfire, was written by the English novelist Anne Fine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-14T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Nine Days in One Year review – enduringly powerful Soviet nuclear power drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","fields":{"bodyText":"As the French New Wave was starting to crest, and with the Cuban missile crisis just under a year away, Soviet film-maker Mikhail Romm directed what might have been the nuclear physicists’ version of Jules et Jim. This was the very intriguing Nine Days in One Year, now restored for its 60th anniversary. It’s a poignant love triangle, a story of broken hearts represented, in a rather David Nicholls-ish device, by the events of nine separate days over one year in the romantic lives of those whose duty was to the Soviet motherland – and to the great cause of the USSR gaining nuclear power. Dmitri Gusev, played by Aleksey Batalov, is a dedicated scientist working on thermonuclear physics in Siberia, whose work has for years taken him away from his humble family in the country. His more playful and worldly scientist friend Ilya (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) is back in Moscow. They are both in love with the same woman: the passionate, focused, beautiful scientist Lyolya (Tatyana Lavrova). At the beginning of the story, Lyolya and Ilya are engaged to be married, but a visit to her former lover Dimitri reveals to Lyolya his heroic dedication and the fact that he has endangered his life with potentially fatal irradiation. Aware of a certain kind of patriotic and personal vocation, Lyolya nobly resolves to marry Dimitri instead, but Ilya, masking his feelings with a certain kind of cynical gaiety, remains in their lives, perhaps sensing Lyolya’s frustration and unhappiness in her marriage. There is a dark, shadowy expressionism in the film, an occult sense of mystery and danger in the underground corridors of the lab. Irradiation is maybe a metaphor for lovesickness, but perhaps the symbol only works if we understand love to mean love of science, or love of country. This is a story of people who unquestioningly sacrifice personal considerations for the Soviet nuclear cause, and yet this lost love looms alongside the Soviet Union’s nuclear destiny with equal potency. • Nine Days in One Year is screening on 15 February at the Institut Français in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/28/gorecki-symphony-of-sorrowful-songs-review-english-national-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T11:43:40Z","webTitle":"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs review – Gorecki’s triptych retains its visceral power in thoughtful staging","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/28/gorecki-symphony-of-sorrowful-songs-review-english-national-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/28/gorecki-symphony-of-sorrowful-songs-review-english-national-opera","fields":{"bodyText":"Henryk Górecki’s Third Symphony, known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, is that rarest of phenomena, an unashamedly classical work that connects with people way beyond the concert hall. The London Sinfonietta’s 1991 recording, with Dawn Upshaw a radiant soloist, topped the US classical chart for more than 40 weeks. Clearly the work’s contemplative sincerity struck a chord in a post-iron curtain world. The Polish-born composer had commenced his career embracing a gnarly, post-Webern serialism. His shift to sparer textures and Renaissance-inspired harmonies went down like a lead balloon with modernists - Pierre Boulez was heard summing up the Third Symphony at its 1977 premiere in a single word: “Merde!” Górecki didn’t care. He’d witnessed war first-hand and had visited Auschwitz in 1945. His musical triptych on motherhood and suffering clearly resonates with Isabella Bywater, who has staged the piece for English National Opera. Set inside what at first appears to be a granitic geometric wedge, she conjures a series of snapshots of women coping with loss. The opening scene reveals a mother kneeling at a grave (American soprano Nicole Chevalier plays all three women). Her son floats above her, suspended between heaven and earth. As rumbling double basses commence Górecki’s long, ascending crescendo, the charcoal-grey walls appear to melt and flow. Roberto Vitalini’s mesmeric video design and Jon Driscoll’s haunting lighting are major elements in the production’s success, as is Bywater’s set. In a visual sleight of hand, her concrete walls turn out to be a closely knit mesh curtain of ropes through which actors can enter and exit. The imagery is often stunning. In the opening scene, the grieving mother gathers in reams of graveclothes, which she swaddles like a baby. Later, she rises to the ceiling on a chair before tumbling to earth in a graceful slow-motion swan dive. In the following scene, a woman sings words scrawled by a teenage girl on the walls of a Gestapo prison cell in 1942. Embraced by a pair of sinister, hooded figures, she’s dragged away to a despairing “Hail Mary, full of grace”. In the final scene, the jagged tangle of ropes suggests an all-too-familiar modern war zone. Here, a woman searches for the body of her son as faceless soldiers topple around her. It’s visceral stuff, and powerfully sung by Chevalier whose luxurious soprano sails through Górecki’s long lyrical lines. In the pit, Lidiya Yankovskaya leads a refreshingly unsentimental reading of the score. Just occasionally, the production might have benefited from greater stillness – the music, after all, proves the work can take it – but this is an affecting piece of contemporary music theatre from a resurgent opera company thinking outside the box. Symphony of Sorrowful Songs is at the London Coliseum until 6 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","fields":{"bodyText":"If you take the cosmic view of Sellafield, the superannuated nuclear facility in north-west England, its story began long before the Earth took shape. About 9bn years ago, tens of thousands of giant stars ran out of fuel, collapsed upon themselves, and then exploded. The sheer force of these supernova detonations mashed together the matter in the stars’ cores, turning lighter elements like iron into heavier ones like uranium. Flung out by such explosions, trillions of tonnes of uranium traversed the cold universe and wound up near our slowly materialising solar system. And here, over roughly 20m years, the uranium and other bits of space dust and debris cohered to form our planet in such a way that the violent tectonics of the young Earth pushed the uranium not towards its hot core but up into the folds of its crust. Within reach, so to speak, of the humans who eventually came along circa 300,000BC, and who mined the uranium beginning in the 1500s, learned about its radioactivity in 1896 and started feeding it into their nuclear reactors 70-odd years ago, making electricity that could be relayed to their houses to run toasters and light up Christmas trees. Sellafield compels this kind of gaze into the abyss of deep time because it is a place where multiple time spans – some fleeting, some cosmic – drift in and out of view. Laid out over six square kilometres, Sellafield is like a small town, with nearly a thousand buildings, its own roads and even a rail siding – all owned by the government, and requiring security clearance to visit. Sellafield’s presence, at the end of a road on the Cumbrian coast, is almost hallucinatory. One moment you’re passing cows drowsing in pastures, with the sea winking just beyond. Then, having driven through a high-security gate, you’re surrounded by towering chimneys, pipework, chugging cooling plants, everything dressed in steampunk. The sun bounces off metal everywhere. In some spots, the air shakes with the noise of machinery. It feels like the most manmade place in the world. Since it began operating in 1950, Sellafield has had different duties. First it manufactured plutonium for nuclear weapons. Then it generated electricity for the National Grid, until 2003. It also carried out years of fuel reprocessing: extracting uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuel rods after they’d ended their life cycles. The very day before I visited Sellafield, in mid-July, the reprocessing came to an end as well. It was a historic occasion. From an operational nuclear facility, Sellafield turned into a full-time storage depot – but an uncanny, precarious one, filled with toxic nuclear waste that has to be kept contained at any cost. Nothing is produced at Sellafield any more. Which was just as well, because I’d gone to Sellafield not to observe how it lived but to understand how it is preparing for its end. Sellafield’s waste – spent fuel rods, scraps of metal, radioactive liquids, a miscellany of other debris – is parked in concrete silos, artificial ponds and sealed buildings. Some of these structures are growing, in the industry’s parlance, “intolerable”, atrophied by the sea air, radiation and time itself. If they degrade too much, waste will seep out of them, poisoning the Cumbrian soil and water. To prevent that disaster, the waste must be hauled out, the silos destroyed and the ponds filled in with soil and paved over. The salvaged waste will then be transferred to more secure buildings that will be erected on site. But even that will be only a provisional arrangement, lasting a few decades. Nuclear waste has no respect for human timespans. The best way to neutralise its threat is to move it into a subterranean vault, of the kind the UK plans to build later this century. Once interred, the waste will be left alone for tens of thousands of years, while its radioactivity cools. Dealing with all the radioactive waste left on site is a slow-motion race against time, which will last so long that even the grandchildren of those working on site will not see its end. The process will cost at least £121bn. Compared to the longevity of nuclear waste, Sellafield has only been around for roughly the span of a single lunch break within a human life. Still, it has lasted almost the entirety of the atomic age, witnessing both its earliest follies and its continuing confusions. In 1954, Lewis Strauss, the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, predicted that nuclear energy would make electricity “too cheap to meter”. That forecast has aged poorly. The main reason power companies and governments aren’t keener on nuclear power is not that activists are holding them back or that uranium is difficult to find, but that producing it safely is just proving too expensive. Strauss was, like many others, held captive by one measure of time and unable to truly fathom another. The short-termism of policymaking neglected any plans that had to be made for the abominably lengthy, costly life of radioactive waste. I kept being told, at Sellafield, that science is still trying to rectify the decisions made in undue haste three-quarters of a century ago. Many of the earliest structures here, said Dan Bowman, the head of operations at one of Sellafield’s two waste storage ponds, “weren’t even built with decommissioning in mind”. As a result, Bowman admitted, Sellafield’s scientists are having to invent, mid-marathon, the process of winding the site down – and they’re finding that they still don’t know enough about it. They don’t know exactly what they’ll find in the silos and ponds. They don’t know how much time they’ll need to mop up all the waste, or how long they’ll have to store it, or what Sellafield will look like afterwards. The decommissioning programme is laden “with assumptions and best guesses”, Bowman told me. It will be finished a century or so from now. Until then, Bowman and others will bend their ingenuity to a seemingly self-contradictory exercise: dismantling Sellafield while keeping it from falling apart along the way. * * * To take apart an ageing nuclear facility, you have to put a lot of other things together first. New technologies, for instance, and new buildings to replace the intolerable ones, and new reserves of money. (That £121bn price tag may swell further.) All of Sellafield is in a holding pattern, trying to keep waste safe until it can be consigned to the ultimate strongroom: the geological disposal facility (GDF), bored hundreds of metres into the Earth’s rock, a project that could cost another £53bn. Even if a GDF receives its first deposit in the 2040s, the waste has to be delivered and put away with such exacting caution that it can be filled and closed only by the middle of the 22nd century. Anywhere else, this state of temporariness might induce a mood of lax detachment, like a transit lounge to a frequent flyer. But at Sellafield, with all its caches of radioactivity, the thought of catastrophe is so ever-present that you feel your surroundings with a heightened keenness. At one point, when we were walking through the site, a member of the Sellafield team pointed out three different waste storage facilities within a 500-metre radius. The spot where we stood on the road, he said, “is probably the most hazardous place in Europe”. Sellafield’s waste comes in different forms and potencies. Spent fuel rods and radioactive pieces of metal rest in skips, which in turn are submerged in open, rectangular ponds, where water cools them and absorbs their radiation. The skips have held radioactive material for so long that they themselves count as waste. The pond beds are layered with nuclear sludge: degraded metal wisps, radioactive dust and debris. Discarded cladding, peeled off fuel rods like banana-skins, fills a cluster of 16-metre-deep concrete silos partially sunk into the earth. More dangerous still are the 20 tonnes of melted fuel inside a reactor that caught fire in 1957 and has been sealed off and left alone ever since. Somewhere on the premises, Sellafield has also stored the 140 tonnes of plutonium it has purified over the decades. It’s the largest such hoard of plutonium in the world, but it, too, is a kind of waste, simply because nobody wants it for weapons any more, or knows what else to do with it. It has been a dithery decade for nuclear policy. After the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, several countries began shuttering their reactors and tearing up plans for new ones. They’d become inordinately expensive to build and maintain, in any case, especially compared to solar and wind installations. In the UK, the fraction of electricity generated by nuclear plants has slid steadily downwards, from 25% in the 1990s to 16% in 2020. Of the five nuclear stations still producing power, only one will run beyond 2028. Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear plant in a generation, is being built in Somerset, but its cost has bloated to more than £25bn. This year, though, governments felt the pressure to redo their sums when sanctions on Russia abruptly choked off supplies of oil and gas. Wealthy nations suddenly found themselves worrying about winter blackouts. In this crisis, governments are returning to the habit they were trying to break. Germany had planned to abandon nuclear fuel by the end of this year, but in October, it extended that deadline to next spring. The US allocated $6bn to save struggling plants; the UK pressed ahead with plans for Sizewell C, a nuclear power station to be built in Suffolk. Japan, its Fukushima trauma just a decade old, announced that it will commission new plants. Even as Sellafield is cleaning up after the first round of nuclear enthusiasm, another is getting under way. * * * Any time spent in Sellafield is scored to a soundtrack of alarms and signals. The radiation trackers clipped to our protective overalls let off soft cheeps, their frequency varying as radioactivity levels changed around us. Before leaving every building, we ran Geiger counters over ourselves – always remembering to scan the tops of our heads and the soles of our feet – and these clacked like rattlesnakes. At one spot, our trackers went mad. A pipe on the outside of a building had cracked, and staff had planted 10ft-tall sheets of lead into the ground around it to shield people from the radiation. It was perfectly safe, my guide assured me. We power-walked past nonetheless. The day I visited Sellafield was the UK’s hottest ever. We sweltered even before we put on heavy boots and overalls to visit the reprocessing plant, where, until the previous day, technicians had culled uranium and plutonium out of spent fuel. Every second, on each of the plant’s four floors, I heard a beep – a regular pulse, reminding everyone that nothing is amiss. “We’ve got folks here who joined at 18 and have been here more than 40 years, working only in this building,” said Lisa Dixon, an operations manager. Dixon’s father had been a welder here, and her husband is one of the firefighters stationed permanently on site. She meets aunts and cousins on her shifts all the time. When she says Sellafield is one big family, she isn’t just being metaphorical. I only ever saw a dummy of a spent fuel rod; the real thing would have been a metre long, weighed 10-12kg, and, when it emerged from a reactor, run to temperatures of 2,800C, half as hot as the surface of the sun. In a reactor, hundreds of rods of fresh uranium fuel slide into a pile of graphite blocks. Then a stream of neutrons, usually emitted by an even more radioactive metal such as californium, is directed into the pile. Those neutrons generate more neutrons out of uranium atoms, which generate still more neutrons out of other uranium atoms, and so on, the whole process begetting vast quantities of heat that can turn water into steam and drive turbines. During this process, some of the uranium atoms, randomly but very usefully, absorb darting neutrons, yielding heavier atoms of plutonium: the stuff of nuclear weapons. The UK’s earliest reactors – a type called Magnox – were set up to harvest plutonium for bombs; the electricity was a happy byproduct. The government built 26 such reactors across the country. They’re all being decommissioned now, or awaiting demolition. It turned out that if you weren’t looking to make plutonium nukes to blow up cities, Magnox was a pretty inefficient way to light up homes and power factories. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, one of Sellafield’s chief tasks was reprocessing. Once uranium and plutonium were extracted from used fuel rods, it was thought, they could be stored safely – and perhaps eventually resold, to make money on the side. Beginning in 1956, spent rods came to Cumbria from plants across the UK, but also by sea from customers in Italy and Japan. Sellafield has taken in nearly 60,000 tonnes of spent fuel, more than half of all such fuel reprocessed anywhere in the world. The rods arrived at Sellafield by train, stored in cuboid “flasks” with corrugated sides, each weighing about 50 tonnes and standing 1.5 metres tall. The flasks were cast from single ingots of stainless steel, their walls a third of a metre thick. Responding to worries about how robust these containers were, the government, in 1984, arranged to have a speeding train collide head-on with a flask. The video is spectacular. At 100mph, a part of the locomotive exploded and the train derailed. But the flask, a few scratches and dents aside, stayed intact. At Sellafield, the rods were first cooled in ponds of water for between 90 and 250 days. Then they were skinned of their cladding and dissolved in boiling nitric acid. From that liquor, technicians separated out uranium and plutonium, powdery like cumin. This cycle, from acid to powder, lasted up to 36 hours, Dixon said – and it hadn’t improved a jot in efficiency in the years she’d been there. The only change was the dwindling number of rods coming in, as Magnox reactors closed everywhere. The day before I met Dixon, technicians had fed one final batch of spent fuel into acid – and that was that, the end of reprocessing. It marked Sellafield’s transition from an operational facility to a depot devoted purely to storage and containment. The rods went in late in the evening, after hours of technical hitches, so the moment itself was anticlimactic. “They just dropped through, and you heard nothing. So it was like: ‘OK, that’s it? Let’s go home,’” Dixon said. But the following morning, when I met her, she felt sombre, she admitted. “Everybody’s thinking: ‘What do we do? There’s no fuel coming in.’ I don’t think it’s really hit the team just yet.” The reprocessing plant’s end was always coming. The pipes and steam lines, many from the 1960s, kept fracturing. Dixon’s team was running out of spare parts that aren’t manufactured any more. “Since December 2019,” Dixon said, “I’ve only had 16 straight days of running the plant at any one time.” Best to close it down – to conduct repairs, clean the machines and take them apart. Then, at last, the reprocessing plant will be placed on “fire watch”, visited periodically to ensure nothing in the building is going up in flames, but otherwise left alone for decades for its radioactivity to dwindle, particle by particle. * * * Like malign glitter, radioactivity gets everywhere, turning much of what it touches into nuclear waste. The humblest items – a paper towel or a shoe cover used for just a second in a nuclear environment – can absorb radioactivity, but this stuff is graded as low-level waste; it can be encased in a block of cement and left outdoors. (Cement is an excellent shield against radiation. A popular phrase in the nuclear waste industry goes: “When in doubt, grout.”) Even the paper towel needs a couple of hundred years to shed its radioactivity and become safe, though. A moment of use, centuries of quarantine: radiation tends to twist time all out of proportion. On the other hand, high-level waste – the byproduct of reprocessing – is so radioactive that its containers will give off heat for thousands of years. It, too, will become harmless over time, but the scale of that time is planetary, not human. The number of radioactive atoms in the kind of iodine found in nuclear waste byproducts halves every 16m years. In comparison, consider how different the world looked a mere 7,000 years ago, when a determined pedestrian could set out from the Humber estuary, in northern England, and walk across to the Netherlands and then to Norway. Planning for the disposal of high-level waste has to take into account the drift of continents and the next ice age. All radioactivity is a search for stability. Most of the atoms in our daily lives – the carbon in the wood of a desk, the oxygen in the air, the silicon in window glass – have stable nuclei. But in the atoms of some elements like uranium or plutonium, protons and neutrons are crammed into their nuclei in ways that make them unsteady – make them radioactive. These atoms decay, throwing off particles and energy over years or millennia until they become lighter and more stable. Nuclear fuel is radioactive, of course, but so is nuclear waste, and the only thing that can render such waste harmless is time. Waste can travel incognito, to fatal effect: radioactive atoms carried by the wind or water, entering living bodies, riddling them with cancer, ruining them inside out. During the 1957 reactor fire at Sellafield, a radioactive plume of particles poured from the top of a 400-foot chimney. A few days later, some of these particles were detected as far away as Germany and Norway. Near Sellafield, radioactive iodine found its way into the grass of the meadows where dairy cows grazed, so that samples of milk taken in the weeks after the fire showed 10 times the permissible level. The government had to buy up milk from farmers living in 500 sq km around Sellafield and dump it in the Irish Sea. From the outset, authorities hedged and fibbed. For three days, no one living in the area was told about the gravity of the accident, or even advised to stay indoors and shut their windows. Workers at Sellafield, reporting their alarming radiation exposure to their managers, were persuaded that they’d “walk [it] off on the way home”, the Daily Mirror reported at the time. A government inquiry was then held, but its report was not released in full until 1988. For nearly 30 years, few people knew that the fire dispersed not just radioactive iodine but also polonium, far more deadly. The estimated toll of cancer cases has been revised upwards continuously, from 33 to 200 to 240. Sellafield took its present name only in 1981, in part to erase the old name, Windscale, and the associated memories of the fire. The invisibility of radiation and the opacity of governments make for a bad combination. Sellafield hasn’t suffered an accident of equivalent scale since the 1957 fire, but the niggling fear that some radioactivity is leaking out of the facility in some fashion has never entirely vanished. In 1983, a Sellafield pipeline discharged half a tonne of radioactive solvent into the sea. British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the government firm then running Sellafield, was fined £10,000. Around the same time, a documentary crew found higher incidences than expected of leukaemia among children in some surrounding areas. A government study concluded that radiation from Sellafield wasn’t to blame. Perhaps, the study suggested, the leukaemia had an undetected, infectious cause. It was no secret that Sellafield kept on site huge stashes of spent fuel rods, waiting to be reprocessed. This was lucrative work. An older reprocessing plant on site earned £9bn over its lifetime, half of it from customers overseas. But the pursuit of commercial reprocessing turned Sellafield and a similar French site into “de facto waste dumps”, the journalist Stephanie Cooke found in her book In Mortal Hands. Sellafield now requires £2bn a year to maintain. What looked like a smart line of business back in the 1950s has now turned out to be anything but. With every passing year, maintaining the world’s costliest rubbish dump becomes more and more commercially calamitous. The expenditure rises because structures age, growing more rickety, more prone to mishap. In 2005, in an older reprocessing plant at Sellafield, 83,000 litres of radioactive acid – enough to fill a few hundred bathtubs – dripped out of a ruptured pipe. The plant had to be shut down for two years; the cleanup cost at least £300m. The year before the pandemic, a sump tank attached to a waste pond sprang a leak and had to be grouted shut. Around the same time, an old crack in a waste silo opened up again. It posed no health risk, Sellafield determined, so it was still dripping liquid into the ground when I visited. The silos are rudimentary concrete bins, built for waste to be tipped in, but for no other kind of access. Their further degradation is a sure thing. It all put me in mind of a man who’d made a house of ice in deepest winter but now senses spring around the corner, and must move his furniture out before it all melts and collapses around him. * * * Some industrial machines have soothing names; the laser snake is not one of them. After its fat, six-metre-long body slinks out of its cage-like housing, it can rear up in serpentine fashion, as if scanning its surroundings for prey. Its anatomy is made up of accordion folds, so it can stretch and compress on command. The snake’s face is the size and shape of a small dinner plate, with a mouth through which it fires a fierce, purple shaft of light. The laser can slice through inches-thick steel, sparks flaring from the spot where the beam blisters the metal. It took two years and £5m to develop this instrument. If Philip K Dick designed your nightmares, the laser snake would haunt them. Six years ago, the snake’s creators put it to work in a demo at Sellafield. A 10-storey building called B204 had been Sellafield’s first reprocessing facility, but in 1973, a rogue chemical reaction filled the premises with radioactive gas. Thirty-four workers were contaminated, and the building was promptly closed down. Gas, fuel rods and radioactive equipment were all left in place, in sealed rooms known as cells, which turned so lethal that humans haven’t entered them since. The snake, though, could slither right in – through a hole drilled into a cell wall, and right up to a two-metre-high, double-walled steel vat once used to dissolve fuel in acid. Like so much else in B204, the vat was radioactive waste. It had to be disposed of, but it was too big to remove in one piece. For six weeks, Sellafield’s engineers prepared for the task, rehearsing on a 3D model, ventilating the cell, setting up a stream of air to blow away the molten metal, ensuring that nothing caught fire from the laser’s sparks. Once in action, the snake took mere minutes to cut up the vat. But then the pieces were left in the cell. No one had figured out yet how to remove them. The snake hasn’t been deployed since 2015, because other, more urgent tasks lie at hand. As a project, tackling Sellafield’s nuclear waste is a curious mix of sophistication and what one employee called the “poky stick” approach. On the one hand, it calls for ingenious machines like the laser snake, conceived especially for Sellafield. But the years-long process of scooping waste out can also feel crude and time-consuming – “like emptying a wheelie bin with a teaspoon”, Phil Atherton, a manager working with the silo team, told me. New forms of storage have to be devised for the waste, once it’s removed. These have to be secure and robust – but they can’t be irretrievably secure and robust, because scientists may yet develop better ways to deal with waste. “You don’t want to do anything that forecloses any prospective solutions,” Atherton said. No possible version of the future can be discounted. We walked on the roof of the silos, atop their heavy concrete caps. Below us, submerged in water, lay decades’ worth of intermediate-level waste – not quite as radioactive as spent fuel rods, but more harmful than low-level paper towels. Most of it was swarf – the cladding skinned off fuel rods, broken into chunks three or four inches long. What Atherton really wanted to show off, though, was a new waste retrieval system: a machine as big as a studio apartment, designed from scratch over two decades and built at a cost of £100m. Its 13,500 working parts together weigh 350 tonnes. It perched on rails running the length of the building, so that it could be moved and positioned above an uncapped silo. An operator sits inside the machine, reaching long, mechanical arms into the silo to fish out waste. In the water’s gloom, cameras offer little help, he said: “You’re mostly playing by feel.” In the two preceding months, the team had pulled out enough waste to fill four skips. Eventually there will be two more retrieval machines in the silos, their arms poking and clasping like the megafauna cousins of those fairground soft-toy grabbers. Even so, it will take until 2050 to empty all the silos. The skips of extricated waste will be compacted to a third of their volume, grouted and moved into another Sellafield warehouse; at some point, they will be sequestered in the ground, in the GDF that is, at present, hypothetical. Not far from the silos, I met John Cassidy, who has helped manage one of Sellafield’s waste storage ponds for more than three decades – so long that a colleague called him “the Oracle”. Cassidy’s pond, which holds 14,000 cubic metres of water, resembles an extra-giant, extra-filthy lido planted in the middle of an industrial park. In the water, the skips full of used fuel rods were sometimes stacked three deep, and when one was placed in or pulled out, rods tended to tumble out on to the floor of the pond. We climbed a staircase in a building constructed over a small part of the pond. On one floor, we stopped to look at a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV – a steamer trunk-sized thing with a yellow carapace, floating in the algal-green water. “You see the little arm at the end of it?” Cassidy said. “So it’ll float down to the bottom of the pond, pick up a nuclear rod that has fallen out of a skip, and put it back into the skip.” Sometimes, though, a human touch is required. This winter, Sellafield will hire professional divers from the US. Nuclear plants keep so much water on hand – to cool fuel, moderate the reactor’s heat, or generate steam – that a class of specialist divers works only in the ponds and tanks at these plants, inspecting and repairing them. In Sellafield, these nuclear divers will put on radiation-proof wetsuits and tidy up the pond floor, reaching the places where robotic arms cannot go. Two floors above, a young Sellafield employee sat in a gaming chair, working at a laptop with a joystick. He was manoeuvring an ROV fitted with a toilet brush – “a regular brush, bought at the store,” he said, “just kind of reinforced with a bit of plastic tube”. With a delicacy not ordinarily required of it, the toilet brush wiped debris and algae off a skip until the digits “9738”, painted in black, appeared on the skip’s flank. When they arrived over the years, during the heyday of reprocessing, the skips were unloaded into pools so haphazardly that Sellafield is now having to build an underwater map of what is where, just to know best how to get it all out. Skip No 9738 went into the map, one more hard-won addition to Sellafield’s knowledge of itself. * * * “Waste disposal is a completely solved problem,” Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, declared in 1979. He was right, but only in theory. The nuclear industry certainly knew about the utility of water, steel and concrete as shields against radioactivity, and by the 1970s, the US government had begun considering burying reactor waste in a GDF. But Teller was glossing over the details, namely: the expense of keeping waste safe, the duration over which it has to be maintained, the accidents that could befall it, the fallout of those accidents. Four decades on, not a single GDF has begun to operate anywhere in the world. Teller’s complete solution is still a hypothesis. Instead, there have been only interim solutions, although to a layperson, even these seem to have been conceived in some scientist’s intricate delirium. High-level waste, like the syrupy liquor formed during reprocessing, has to be cooled first, in giant tanks. Then it is vitrified: mixed with three parts glass beads and a little sugar, until it turns into a hot block of dirty-brown glass. (The sugar reduces the waste’s volatility. “We like to get ours from Tate &amp; Lyle,” Eva Watson-Graham, a Sellafield information officer, said.) Since 1991, stainless steel containers full of vitrified waste, each as tall as a human, have been stacked 10-high in a warehouse. If you stand on the floor above them, Watson-Graham said, you can still sense a murmuring warmth on the soles of your shoes. Even this elaborate vitrification is insufficient in the long, long, long run. Fire or flood could destroy Sellafield’s infrastructure. Terrorists could try to get at the nuclear material. Governments change, companies fold, money runs out. Nations dissolve. Glass degrades. The ground sinks and rises, so that land becomes sea and sea becomes land. The contingency planning that scientists do today – the kind that wasn’t done when the industry was in its infancy – contends with yawning stretches of time. Hence the GDF: a terrestrial cavity to hold waste until its dangers have dried up and it becomes as benign as the surrounding rock. A glimpse of such an endeavour is available already, beneath Finland. From Helsinki, if you drive 250km west, then head another half-km down, you will come to a warren of tunnels called Onkalo. Other underground vaults have been built to store intermediate waste, but for briefer periods; one that opened in a salt cavern in New Mexico in 1999 will last merely 10,000 years. If Onkalo begins operating on schedule, in 2025, it will be the world’s first GDF for spent fuel and high-level reactor waste – 6,500 tonnes of the stuff, all from Finnish nuclear stations. It will cost €5.5bn and is designed to be safe for a million years. The species that is building it, Homo sapiens, has only been around for a third of that time. Constructed by a firm named Posiva, Onkalo has been hewn into the island of Olkiluoto, a brief bridge’s length off Finland’s south-west coast. When I visited in October, the birches on Olkiluoto had turned to a hot blush. The air was pure Baltic brine. In a van, we went down a steep, dark ramp for a quarter of an hour until we reached Onkalo’s lowest level, and here I caught the acrid odour of a closed space in which heavy machinery has run for a long time. Up close, the walls were pimpled and jagged, like stucco, but at a distance, the rock’s surface undulated like soft butter. Twice, we followed a feebly lit tunnel only to turn around and drive back up. “I still get lost sometimes here,” said Sanna Mustonen, a geologist with Posiva, “even after all these years.” After Onkalo takes in all its waste, these caverns will be sealed up to the surface with bentonite, a kind of clay that absorbs water, and that is often found in cat litter. It took four decades just to decide the location of Finland’s GDF. So much had to be considered, Mustonen said. How easy would it be to drill and blast through the 1.9bn-year-old bedrock below the site? How dry is it below ground? How stable will the waste be amidst the fracture zones in these rocks? What are the odds of tsunamis and earthquakes? How high will the sea rise? How will the rock bear up if, in the next ice age, tens of thousands of years from today, a kilometre or two of ice forms on the surface? Accidents had to be modelled. Fifteen years after the New Mexico site opened, a drum of waste burst open, leaking radiation up an exhaust shaft and then for a kilometre or so above ground. (The cause was human error: someone had added a wheat-based cat litter into the drum instead of bentonite.) In late 2021, Posiva submitted all its studies and contingency plans to the Finnish government to seek an operating license. The document ran to 17,000 pages. In the 2120s, once it has been filled, Onkalo will be sealed and turned over to the state. Other countries also plan to banish their nuclear waste into GDFs. Sweden has already selected its spot, Switzerland and France are trying to finalise theirs. The UK’s plans are at an earlier stage. A government agency, Nuclear Waste Services, is studying locations and talking to the people living there, but already the ballpark expenditure is staggering. “If the geology is simple, and we’re disposing of just high- and intermediate-level waste, then we’re thinking £20bn,” said Jonathan Turner, a geologist with Nuclear Waste Services. The ceiling – for now – is £53bn. “It’s a major project,” Turner said, “like the Chunnel or the Olympics.” At the moment, Nuclear Waste Services is in discussions with four communities about the potential to host a GDF. Three are in Cumbria, and if the GDF does wind up in this neighbourhood, the Sellafield enterprise would have come full circle. The GDF will effectively entomb not just decades of nuclear waste but also the decades-old idea that atomic energy will be both easy and cheap – the very idea that drove the creation of Sellafield, where the world’s earliest nuclear aspirations began. On one of my afternoons in Sellafield, I was shown around a half-made building: a £1bn factory that would pack all the purified plutonium into canisters to be sent to a GDF. We ducked through half-constructed corridors and emerged into the main, as-yet-roofless hall. Eventually, the plant will be taller than Westminster Abbey – and as part of the decommissioning process, this structure too will be torn down once it has finished its task, decades from now. I stood there for a while, transfixed by the sight of a building going up even as its demolition was already foretold, feeling the water-filled coolness of the fresh, metre-thick concrete walls, and trying to imagine the distant, dreamy future in which all of Sellafield would be returned to fields and meadows again. • This article was amended on 16 December 2022.

One of Florida’s notorious and plentiful green invasive iguanas wreaked chaos earlier this week in one city after scuttling into an electricity substation in Lake Worth Beach and somehow causing a huge power cut. The authorities announced a “large scale outage” on Wednesday after an iguana “came into contact” with a transformer at the station. The power fried, and so did the lizard. “[Lake Worth Beach] Electric Utility is currently responding to a large scale outage caused by an iguana at our 6th Ave Substation,” the city tweeted just before noon on Wednesday. “This outage is effecting customers in the South East area of our service territory. Our teams are working hard to repair the damage and restore the system.” The power was restored not long afterwards but one woman commenting on the city’s Facebook post said the iguana in her neighborhood “went up under the transformer or something but he blew it and he fried”. The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission considers the iguana invasive – they are native to Central America and parts of South America and some Caribbean islands. But they are omnipresent in south Florida and can grow to more than 5ft long. The reptiles are notorious for disrupting traffic and digging under structures – and for dropping, catatonic, out of trees in cold weather. They are also good swimmers, have a big appetite and are also appetizing to humans who have a taste for their meat. Cities such as Miami Beach that once saw little to no non-native reptile activity have been overwhelmed by the proliferation of the large, spiny lizards that damage buildings by digging burrows underneath, devastate plants and landscaping, and defecate at will. The authorities are trying various ways to dent their numbers. Meanwhile, in Lake Worth Beach, a city spokesman, Ben Kerr, told local TV that iguanas have a tendency to get into electricity substations and cause damage. While extra precautions have been taken, he said: “They are so big they basically straddle the [power] lines” and shimmy into places where they don’t belong. In this case, the iguana’s zapped remains were removed by workers and with a bit of repair work the city’s lights came back on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T20:58:14Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: solar soothes power prices, gamblers face credit card ban, Jerry Springer dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone. “People should not be betting with money they do not have,” says the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, as she makes a strong case for the government’s attempt to ban gamblers from topping up their wagering accounts with credit cards.

First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it? John French Brockweir, Gloucestershire • Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.” Andrew Warren Chairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation • The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C. How is spending more than five times as much on a controversial power source that takes 10 years to build a good idea?

Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based NGO, said insufficient progress was being made to avoid “climate chaos” and that plans for a sharp increase in the number of coal-fired plants in China would require even steeper cuts to the rest of the global fleet to meet the world’s climate goals. In order to meet the Paris climate agreement, all coal-fired plants need to be closed by 2040 and no new ones can come online. Developed economies are expected to shut their plants a decade earlier than the global phaseout. This will require countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to close 60 gigawatts of coal-power capacityeach year until 2030 – about four-and-a-half times the amount recorded last year. Non-OECD countries will need to close 91GW of coal power capacity every year until 2040. The global survey found that although the total amount of existing and planned coal plant capacity outside China fell last year, the phaseout has slowed compared with previous years. China is also preparing to drastically increase its usage of coal, with plans to build enough new plants to more than offset the capacity retired across the US and the EU combined last year. “At this rate, the transition away from existing and new coal isn’t happening fast enough to avoid climate chaos,” said Flora Champenois, the lead author of the report and project manager for Global Energy Monitor’s global coal plant tracker. “The more new coal projects come online, the steeper the cuts and commitments need to be in the future.” Overall, the world’s existing fleet grew by 19.5GW last year, of which more than half was commissioned in China. The country also has plans to increase its coal power capacity by a further 126GW – dwarfing reductions in usage made in developing countries. The US took the global lead in retiring coal power, shutting 13.5GW of capacity last year. In the EU, closures slowed from 14.6GW of capacity in 2021 to 2.2GW in 2022, as the bloc responded to the war in Ukraine driving up the cost of gas-fired power generation. “Progress in retiring coal power plants in rich countries and cancelling new coal power projects in developing countries, despite the gas crunch that shook global energy markets in 2022, is encouraging,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a thinktank. “Outside of China, the response to the energy crisis was dominated by investment in clean energy. However, that progress urgently needs to be accelerated. China pulled in the opposite direction, sharply increasing planned coal power capacity, showing the need to deploy clean solutions and better enforcement of existing policies that should restrict new coal power projects,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin’s plan to station nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘irresponsible’ and ‘escalatory’, says Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s ground forces commander has said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed. President Zelenskiy posted a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has said he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Grossi said, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. President Zelenskiy visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia on Monday, his office said, during a visit to one of the partly occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”, his office said. The 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border, according to a report. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported, citing unnamed sources. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow had made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent the Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and the billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If confirmed genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions. Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. Video released by a Russian assault unit details what they describe as ‘criminal’ commands to block a retreat following 14 days of nonstop mortar fire and shelling. Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard describing the conditions of the Storm group, which initially had 161 members, in an appeal to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Read the full story here: A United Nations expert advising the International Olympic Committee has provoked outrage by claiming that Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine should be allowed to compete at the Paris 2024 Games – as long as they have not committed war crimes. Alexandra Xanthaki, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, angered Ukrainian athletes on an IOC‑hosted call by saying that only Russians implicated directly in crimes against humanity or propaganda for war should be barred from international sport. “I don’t think that it makes sense to exclude all Russian soldiers and all Russian military,” Xanthaki told athlete representatives from most of the 206 national Olympic committees. It is discriminatory because there were a lot of other athletes [from other countries] … in active military operations and they were never excluded. However, every athlete has to be excluded if they are found guilty of atrocity, of serious human rights violations in times of war, including crimes against humanity and genocide. And also they can be excluded if they are found guilty of propaganda for war but on an individual basis. It is unclear how far the IOC will follow her advice at an executive board meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to offer updated guidelines to sports about how Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for Paris. The Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was on the call, said: Her comments sounded pretty insane. And it was clear from the questions she received that many others were shocked that she was advocating a way for Russians to compete despite their illegal war. Heraskevych, who held up a sign saying “No war in Ukraine” at the Winter Olympics last year before the invasion of his country, said Xanthaki’s knowledge of sport also appeared limited. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of a Russian missile strike in Ukraine’s eastern city of Sloviansk. At least two people have been killed and 29 wounded by Monday’s attack, according to the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions, ending months of foot-dragging by the ruling Fidesz party on the issue. With Hungary’s approval, Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. The bill on Sweden’s Nato accession remains stranded in the Hungarian parliament. Video released by Ukraine’s presidential office and the country’s emergency services show destruction in the eastern city of Sloviansk after a deadly strike by Russian forces, which killed at least two people and injured dozens more. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, local leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said in an online statement. The city is in the partly occupied Donetsk region, the scene of fierce fighting since the start of the war more than a year ago. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. She added: We will, of course, not be swayed in our course of supporting Ukraine in its self-defence. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Sasse also dismissed a report about the imminent expulsion of 30 Russian diplomats, saying “such a measure is currently not planned”. A giant recruitment advert for Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has appeared on an office building next to a highway in north-east Moscow, showing the group’s logo and slogans such as “Join the winning team!” and “Together we will win”. Wagner, which is thought to have sustained heavy losses in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, has sought to replenish troops before a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shared a video clip of the Ukrainian president meeting troops in frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia earlier today. Zelenskiy said he held a meeting to discuss the “operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons” during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. “We sat under open mortar fire and artillery for 14 days,” Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard saying in the appeal, which first appeared on Friday on Russian Telegram channels. We took huge losses. Thirty-four people were injured and 22 died, including our commander. Another soldier said the unit initially comprised 161 men at the start of the operations. Gorin said his men made the decision to head back to the Russian army headquarters but were denied evacuation by their superiors: They placed barrier troops behind us and weren’t letting us leave our position … They are threatening to destroy us one by one and as a unit. They want to execute us as witnesses of a completely negligent criminal leadership. Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”, his office said. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed. President Zelenskiy posted a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Ukraine’s ground forces commander has said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. The 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border, according to a report. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported, citing unnamed sources. An attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol, according to Russian state media. A Russian-installed official in the occupied territory was cited by state-run Tass news agency as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The Kremlin said it was for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent the Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and the billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If confirmed genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow had made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian media last week published a 30-minute leaked phone conversation allegedly between the prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and the Russian leadership. Akhmedov, a former Russian senator, has been targeted by western sanctions for his proximity to the Kremlin regime, while Prigozhin (no relation to Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin) is seen as a longtime supporter of the Kremlin. “There’s no doubt about the fact that they fucked up the country,” a man whose voice closely resembles that of Prigozhin’s says on the recording. The same man also refers to Putin’s inner circle as “washed-up lowlifes” who act as if they are “gods”. “He is Satan. Totally vacuous,” Akhmedov allegedly said of Putin. He screwed all of us over. Everyone and everything. The entire country. The entire population, for fuck’s sake. It was not possible to independently verify the clip’s veracity, Prigozhin on Sunday called the audio a “provocation” aimed at “creating a split” within the Russian elites. While initially calling the clip “fake news”, Prigozhin in a later reaction said that the clip contained “some real moments” from his conversation with Akhmedov. “The voice is similar to mine. But it is not clear how the call was glued together. We need to figure it out,” the producer said. Akhmedov has not yet commented on the recording. If confirmed genuine, the audio provides a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites, many of whom have privately voiced their opposition towards the war. Der Spiegel is reporting that the 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, the report added, citing unnamed sources. In January, the German government announced it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, overcoming misgivings about sending heavy weaponry that Kyiv sees as crucial to defeat the Russian invasion. Berlin’s decision paved the way for other countries to re-export some of their German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said on Monday he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. The power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since almost the very beginning of the Russian invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Reuters reports that Grossi wrote in a tweet, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Adding to his previous message on Telegram, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given his account of a meeting held while he was visiting to Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s president posted: Meeting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia: operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons. The regional leadership of the security service and the national police of Ukraine delivered reports. We are working and keeping all important issues under control. The first images have come in of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Zaporizhzhia region today. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia today. Citing the president’s office, it said Ukraine’s president “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy himself posted to his Telegram channel a video clip of him meeting soldiers, alongside the message: I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine. Thank you for protecting our state, our homes, territorial integrity and life in Ukraine. I wish you good health. I wish you a great victory and it will definitely come true. Here are some drone images from Bakhmut that were released at the weekend showing the extent of the destruction of the city, which had a population of about 70,000 before the start of the war. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. The unnamed accountant at Lyman’s department of social protection and labour was accused of registering a local tax office, treasury and social insurance fund with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, as well as recruiting workers and paying them salaries in rubles. Ukrainian forces recaptured Lyman in September, after which the official was arrested. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, has warned that Moscow has the weapons to destroy any enemy, including the US, if its own existence is threatened. Patrushev, in an interview with the state Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, said: American politicians trapped by their own propaganda remain confident that, in the event of a direct conflict with Russia, the United States is capable of launching a preventive missile strike, after which Russia will no longer be able to respond. This is shortsighted stupidity, and very dangerous. He added: Russia is patient and does not intimidate anyone with its military advantage. But it has modern unique weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in the event of a threat to its existence. A quick snap from Reuters: the Kremlin has denied Turkish reports that Vladimir Putin planned to visit the Turkish capital, Ankara. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, also used his visit to the UK to call for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate Russia’s war crimes. “We want to use all the legal mechanisms to make sure Russia is defeated legally, held accountable for all the crimes they commit in Ukraine,” he said, adding that the crimes were “not real if they are not prosecuted”. Addressing MPs and peers, he called for the UK to recognise the Soviet-era Holodomor famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33 as genocide, and said it was “connected” to today’s crimes. The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart to Westminster, telling him: “Our parliament is your parliament.” He added: Ukrainian politicians play a vital role in serving their people and telling the world the reality of war. We are a friend that will listen, we are a friend that will support and continue to support. Ukraine is ready to send its pilots to be trained in using western fighter jets, the chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. He said: We are ready for more intense training of Ukrainian servicemen. We’re ready to send our pilots to be trained in fighter jets. We keep saying ‘please give us your experience’. He also thanked the UK for its decision to send 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which paved the way for other nations to follow suit. He added: Today is the time for Britain to become a leader to also open the door to use aircraft and long-range rockets. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said in a Facebook update. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, he said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier said that one person had died in the shelling in Sloviansk. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukraine presidency’s office, has tweeted about the meeting with the Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor, Orlando Bloom. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. They were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The US and Nato have called the incident “an act of sabotage”. Dmitry Birichevsky, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s department for economic cooperation, told state-owned Ria Novosti news agency: We do not rule out later raising the issue of compensation for damage as a result of the explosion. He did not say who Russia would seek damages from, but added: At the moment, it’s very difficult to speak about the future of the Nord Stream pipeline system. On the whole, according to experts, the damaged lines could be restored. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. Russia would establish who was behind the blasts before claiming any compensation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today. Peskov said: For now, the data indicates that such a large-scale act of sabotage and a terrorist attack against critical infrastructure could not have been carried out without the participation of the state and special state services. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the frontline near the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: “Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rocket salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in populated areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it said, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between itself and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. “We strongly believe that now is not the time to consider the opening up of a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to the Olympic Games in any status,” Reuters reports the Polish foreign ministry said in a statement. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” The source informed Tass that the car exploded a few metres away from the police chief. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. The claims have not been independently verified. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Reuters reports prosecutors in the northern Polish city of Gdansk said in a statement that the suspect was detained on 21 March. “The findings made in the case show that the suspect acted for the benefit of Russian intelligence by obtaining and collecting information … on critical infrastructure in the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian regions, and on the activities of services and bodies responsible for security,” they said. “The information obtained was passed on to the Russian intelligence service,” the statement added. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. The state-owned Russian news agency RIA reports on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reports, without specifying further. A video clip appears to show smoke rising over the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided. Debris clearance is ongoing. The enemy must know: Ukraine will not forgive the torturing of our people, will not forgive these deaths and wounds. All Russian terrorists will be defeated. Everyone involved in this aggression will be held to account. The message was accompanied by a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. “Since Friday, a queue in front of the only accessible border crossing point on the Belarusian-Polish border, Kozłowiczy, has doubled in size and now totals 1,000 cars,” Reuters reports the country’s border committee said. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. “The most intense phase of the battle for Bakhmut continues. The situation is constantly difficult. The enemy suffers significant losses in human resources, weapons and military equipment but continues to conduct offensive actions,” he said. Praising Ukrainian forces’ resilience in “extremely difficult conditions”, he said: “The defence of Bakhmut is due to military necessity … We are calculating all possible options for the development of events, and will react adequately to the current situation”. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Reuters reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta quoted Patrushev as saying: “In fact, Nato countries are a party to the conflict. They made Ukraine one big military camp. They send weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops, provide them with intelligence”. The deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria may hold consultations in Moscow in early April, Reuters reports, citing RIA. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that yesterday Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia region 14 times. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as its own territory. Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. In its latest update, it claimed Russian forces are focusing their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Kupyansk, Lymansk, Bakhmutsk, Avdiivsk and Marinsk directions, with Ukrainian soldiers claiming to have repelled more than 60 enemy attacks. The Ukrainian air force made three strikes on Russian troops. Ukrainian missile and artillery units also claimed attacks on a command post, four Russian troop concentrations, weapons and military equipment, a radio-electronic ware station and an ammunition depot. The claims have not been independently verified. Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor Orlando Bloom has met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to promote the organisation’s humanitarian work in Ukraine. During the meeting, Bloom said he was “impressed” by the courage and resilience of Ukrainians and Zelenskiy welcomed the work of Unicef, saying the safety of children and their development remain a priority of his government. Bloom also visited Irpin and the village of Demydiv during his tour. Unicef is working to develop a statement to care for children whose parents have been killed in the war and infrastructure for early childhood development, youth projects and start-ups. Russia plans to complete coastal infrastructure needed to host nuclear submarines in the Pacific Ocean, Tass news agency reported on Monday. The nuclear submarines will be capable of carrying the Poseidon nuclear-capable super torpedos first produced in January, four years after they were announced. There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. The torpedoes are being developed for deployment on the Belgorod and Khabarovsk nuclear submarines, Tass reported. Russia Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located on the south-eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Russian far east. The Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk make up the Kamchatka Peninsula’s eastern and western coastlines. The Tass state agency reported that a new division is being formed as part of the submarine forces of the Pacific Fleet, which will include not only Belgorod and Khabarovsk but also other submarines. The new special-purpose submarines will participate in solving the tasks “of strategic deterrence”. Reuters With the cost of reconstruction in Ukraine projected by the World Bank to be $411bn, economist Adam Tooze has examined the changes to the Ukrainian economy that have been forced on it over the course of the invasion. To secure ongoing support from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Tooze notes the Ukrainian government has committed to deep and widespread reforms that would cut labor protections and introduce austerity measures across the economy. Quoting other sources, Tooze writes that Ukraine has “outsourced” most functions of its government beyond what is needed to carry out the military defence of the country - and that this “nightmarish” decision will have consequences for civil society over the long run. A policy of dramatic fiscal austerity that comes at the expense of the fabric of Ukrainian society and the state will have huge long-run costs. The EU, the United States and other outside supporters can soften this dilemma best a. by providing more generous funding and b. by urging Kyiv towards a strategy of civilian as well as military state-building, not by replacing domestic national institutions with international agencies, but by promoting the mobilization of local institutions and agencies. The U.N. nuclear watchdog head will not travel to Russia this week, but a visit is possible in the near future, Russian news agency RIA reported early on Monday, citing Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi announced on Saturday that he would visit the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine this week to assess the serious situation there. When asked if Russia planned to invite Grossi to Moscow in the near future, permanent representative Mikhail Ulyanov said that was “quite realistic”, according to RIA. Not next week, but somewhat later, the visit of Rafael Grossi to Russia may well take place. Grossi is pressing for a security zone to be erected around Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant with six reactors, which has come under repeated shelling during the 13-month war Russia has been waging against its neighbour. - Reuters The ISW also said the continuing of offences around Bakhmut and Avdiivka have become “not merely pointless, but actually harmful to Russian preparations for the next phase of this week”. It said the loss of manpower and equipment means Russian forces will not gain any operational advantage from taking either Bakhmut and Avdiivka as they will be “unable to exploit such advances”. Putin’s continuation of these Russian offensive operations in the current operational and strategic context amounts to strategic malfeasance. It expends scarce Russian combat power in pursuit of operationally meaningless gains rather than setting conditions to receive and defeat a Ukrainian counter-offensive that everyone appears to expect imminently. However, the ISW said Putin’s “stubbornness” could make sense “in a protracted conflict during which western support for Ukraine wanes or ends”. Putin might even mean these operations to set conditions for a negotiated settlement on terms he has already articulated that include international recognition of Russia’s annexation of all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts; Ukrainian “neutrality”; the “de-militarization” of Ukraine; and the “de-Nazification” of the Ukrainian government. The ISW said “multiple major Ukrainian operational-level victories” would be necessary to create “any prospect of a negotiated settlement of the current conflict or forcing Putin to accept unfavorable militaries realities, absent a formal settlement”. The Institute for the Study of War says even a successful series of Ukrainian counteracts may not be enough to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the conflict. In an abbreviated update, the ISW says Putin remains committed to carrying out the military campaign in an effort to “seek complete victory in Ukraine”. Putin instead remains focused on achieving his initial war aims through protracted conflict in which he wins either by imposing his will on Ukraine by force or by breaking Ukraine’s will following the West’s abandonment of Kyiv. It said “multiple successful Ukrainian counteroffensives are almost certainly necessary but not sufficient” to persuade Putin to enter into a negotiation for the end of the war. Instead the Russian President appears to be “doubling down” on the war by continuing to mobilising his country’s industrial base and relying on various shadow-mobilisation schemes to generate the necessary combat power. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian president’s suggestions that the move would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. For more on this story, read the full report by Dan Sabbagh, Sam Jones and Julian Borger. Nato says Vladimir Putin’s plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is “dangerous and irresponsible” and a threat to Russia’s nuclear non-proliferation commitments. Putin likened his Belarus plan on Saturday to the US stationing its weapons in Europe, insisting Russia would not violate its nuclear non-proliferation promises. The move, while not unexpected, is one of Russia’s most pronounced nuclear signals yet and a warning to Nato over its military support for Ukraine. Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said on Sunday: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible”. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own.” Putin’s non-proliferation pledge and his description of US weapons deployment overseas were way off the mark, she added. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments. Experts said Russia’s move was significant since it had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. It may be the first time since the mid-1990s that it has done so. Reuters Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric after Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukraine has reacted to Russia’s plans by calling for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. The head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council has said that the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. More on that shortly. Elsewhere, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Ukrainians to remain engaged in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. Over the last 24 hours, Zelenskiy has met with security services, intelligence and defence to discuss reinforcement and “prepare respective steps”. He also said Ukraine has received €1.5bn in macro-financial assistance from the European Union. Meanwhile heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The city’s prewar population numbered 30,000. In other developments: The UN Nuclear watching head will not visit Russia this week, but another visit is possible in the future. International Atomic Energy Agency Director announced on Sunday he would visit the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in occupied-Ukraine, but said a visit to Russia was being planned for “somewhat later”. Zelenskiy said the Croatian government had adopted a programme to treat wounded Ukrainian soldiers. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday: “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around.” Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Local law enforcement attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast were believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin has said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin said the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-07T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Hunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","fields":{"bodyText":"The Hunterston B nuclear power station will shut down for ever at noon on Friday after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing for the sector. The plant, on the west coast of Scotland, provided one gigawatt of the UK’s 7.9GW nuclear capacity, enough to power to 1.7m homes. But Hunterston B has lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date and is one of several nuclear power plants being taken out of commission within several years of each other. The rapid pace of the decommissioning schedule has raised concerns about maintaining electricity generation. About 20% of Britain’s supply is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors, which help provide a constant baseload to make up for shortfalls when electricity generation from renewables drops on windless days or when the sun is not shining. Almost half of the country’s nuclear capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. While more renewable energy will have been brought online by then and other fuel sources such as gas can fill in the gaps, the remaining 3.6GW of nuclear capacity would only be able to meet 6% of peak demand forecast for this winter. At its peak between 1995 and 1999, nuclear capacity hit nearly 13GW, about a quarter of the UK’s electricity needs. EDF is due to finish its 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C, Britain’s first new nuclear power station in 20 years, by 2027. The first of its two reactors is scheduled to come online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association, which represents companies across the civil nuclear supply chain, estimates that the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. Development is likely to hinge upon government plans for a new financial framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, which would lock in higher returns for institutions funding nuclear plants and transfer risk to taxpayers. The NIA’s projection for the growth of nuclear also depends on the scale of the rollout of Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactors (SMRs), which have received £210m of government funds and £280m from private capital. The association criticised a decision by the Scottish government to bar new nuclear projects in Scotland, saying the gap left by Hunterston B would have to be filled in part with imported gas sourced from volatile global markets. This would drive up consumer bills, hamper emissions reduction plans and threaten Scotland’s energy security, it added. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: “Hunterston B has shown the best of what nuclear can provide for Scotland – clean, reliable power to keep the lights on and save our planet, and long-term, skilled jobs on which people can build a life and a family. “The dedicated staff who have helped keep Scottish homes warm and light for 46 years deserve our gratitude. As the current energy crisis demonstrates, without nuclear the cost of the electricity we rely on is higher, causes pollution and leaves us reliant on burning imported fossil fuels. That’s why we need new nuclear – to get to net zero and provide the reliable, secure and clean power to live our lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/23/iran-planning-massive-expansion-of-uranium-capacity-un-nuclear-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-23T01:05:58Z","webTitle":"Iran planning massive expansion of uranium capacity – UN nuclear watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/23/iran-planning-massive-expansion-of-uranium-capacity-un-nuclear-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/23/iran-planning-massive-expansion-of-uranium-capacity-un-nuclear-watchdog","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog has confirmed Iran is enriching uranium to 60% at a second plant, amid the breakdown of the nuclear deal with major powers. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that Iran was also planning a massive expansion of its enrichment capacity. Iran said earlier on Tuesday that it had started to enrich uranium to 60% at the Fordo site, having already done so at its above-ground pilot plant at Natanz for more than a year. The increased enrichment was seen as a significant addition to its nuclear programme. Enrichment to 60% purity is one short technical step away from weapons grade, 90%. Nonproliferation experts have warned in recent months that Iran has enough 60% enriched uranium to reprocess into fuel for at least one nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied any ambition to develop a nuclear bomb, insisting its nuclear activities are for civilian purposes. The move was part of Iran’s response to the UN nuclear watchdog’s adoption last week of a censure motion drafted by western governments accusing it of non-cooperation. It also comes as talks have stalled to revive a 2015 landmark deal that curbed Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal started to unravel in 2018 when the US withdrew and reimposed sanctions. In response, Iran started to step up its nuclear programme. A joint statement from Germany, France and Britain – the three western European countries that remain in the Iran nuclear deal – condemned Iran’s latest action to further expand its nuclear programme. “Iran’s step is a challenge to the global non-proliferation system,” the statement on Tuesday said. “This step, which carries significant proliferation-related risks, has no credible civilian justification.” This month, the IAEA has said it believes Iran has further increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. As recently as last week, the agency criticised Tehran for continuing to bar its officials from accessing or monitoring Iranian nuclear sites. A separate report said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, was “seriously concerned” that Iran had still not engaged with the agency’s inquiry into manmade uranium particles found at three undeclared sites. The issue has become a key sticking point in the talks for a renewed nuclear deal. It has been nearly two years since IAEA officials have had full access to monitor Iran’s nuclear sites, and five months since IAEA surveillance equipment was removed.

But I didn’t know if I was the right person for the job, you know?” Composer Brendan Angelides has never worked in video game music before. You might know him better as Eskmo or Welder, or perhaps as the mind behind the music of TV shows 13 Reasons Why or Billions. When Ubisoft approached him to be the composer for its sort-of reboot of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Mirage, he had doubts. The game is set at the height of the Islamic golden age, and centres around Baghdad: a hub flowing with the lifeblood of a changing world, a cultural centre of art and science, old and new. “When I first learned that the new Assassin’s Creed takes place in 9th-century Baghdad, I was excited at the prospect of diving into unfamiliar territory,” he explains to me in the middle of a recording session, where the last organic elements of his score are being finalised by the New York Arabic Orchestra. “It was an opportunity to connect with a community that has a tremendous wealth of talented musicians.” But Angelides does not have Arabic heritage, and did not come into the project with a depth of knowledge about how music from that part of the world works. Ubisoft approached him because of the nature of the work he’d done before; similar to Jesper Kyd – the musical architect of the entire Assassin’s Creed series – Angelides is renowned for fusing the orchestral and the electronic, creating weird electronica that’s powerful enough to capture your attention but understated enough not to overwhelm. Perfect for a video game soundtrack, then. But he needed help. Mirage, like the rest of the Assassin’s Creed series, needed to be as historically authentic as possible … and an electronic composer from Connecticut knew he couldn’t do that by himself. “The first person I reached out to was my friend Emel Mathlouthi, who is a Tunisian artist and performer based in New York,” he says. “The next person I sought out was Layth Sidiq, who is an Iraqi-born Jordanian violinist and the artistic director for the New York Arabic Orchestra.” As we chat, that same orchestra is recording a track for the game behind us, and little teases of the emotive, minor key composition begin to lay the foundations for what this game is about: innocence, tragedy, madness, revenge. Sidiq understood Angelides’ motivations and introduced him to Akram Haddad, a Palestinian composer and orchestrator (currently a professor at the New England Conservatory) teaching Middle Eastern music. It was a match made in heaven: Haddad had taught western music while living in Jerusalem, and now taught Middle Eastern music out of New England. The game – primarily aimed at a western audience – needed to be familiar enough to western ears while incorporating Middle Eastern elements for historical accuracy. Haddad and his work sat at the intersection. We’re sitting in an isolated vocal booth in a disused power station relay in the middle of New York City, and it feels very apt. This studio is at the intersection of art and science, a huge building once used to divert power to downtown New York, hollowed out, now redressed and rebuilt to perfectly capture the sounds of orchestras, rock bands and pop acts from all around the world. The Power Station walls are decorated with albums recorded here: Bowie, Springsteen, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Diana Ross. And now, Assassin’s Creed. “Working with Brendan has been an amazing experience for me,” says Haddad. “He sought me out intentionally as a collaborator, and from the very beginning there was a strong sense of mutual respect and musical admiration.” Haddad notes that Angelides gave him a lot of freedom when letting him loose on the compositions the latter had worked on so far. “Throughout our collaboration, there was a great sense of camaraderie and a shared passion for creating something new and exciting,” continues Haddad. “It was clear that we both had a deep love and appreciation for music, and that we were committed to pushing the boundaries of what was possible in our respective traditions.” This is something both musicians kept coming back to in the interview: respect. Haddad repeatedly outlined his awe at Angelides’ “ability to blend electronic and acoustic elements in a way that feels both organic and cutting edge”, while Angelides could not overstate his appreciation for the way Haddad embodied “a sonic blend of western meets Middle Eastern”. The two men told me that they’re already talking about working together after this project. You can hear the evidence of this bond in the music. As unlikely as it may seem, the fusion of electronic and orchestral gels effortlessly with the fusion of Arabic and western. “When incorporating elements from Arabic music into a western soundscape, it’s essential to be mindful of the specific musical idioms and techniques that are characteristic of that tradition,” says Haddad. “For example, the use of trills, microtones, glissandos, and so on, can add a distinctly Arabic flavour to a melody, but these elements need to be carefully integrated into the harmony and overall texture of the piece to avoid sounding out of place, or forced. “At the same time, it’s also important to be mindful of the intended audience and musical context. If the composition is for a big-budget gaming project with a primarily western audience, it may be necessary to adapt the Arabic musical elements in a way that feels familiar and accessible to that audience. This could involve using more familiar western harmonic structures or incorporating Arabic elements in a subtle and understated way.” The Assassin’s Creed Mirage soundtrack is powerful. Watching the orchestra work towards the climax of one of the main pieces that was being recorded in the Power Station studio, I saw gooseflesh prick up on the arms of almost everyone in the room. A moment of eye contact between Haddad in the composer’s spot with the orchestra, and Angelides standing to attention in the recording studio, suggested that they’d nailed it with this take. Assassin’s Creed Mirage will launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T08:26:58Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan’s Turkish election plans disrupted after being taken ill on live TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","fields":{"bodyText":"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has had to abruptly cancel election campaign events after being taken ill on live television during an interview. Cameras abruptly cut away from Erdoğan to one of his interviewers, Hasan Öztürk, who looked perturbed and began to rise from his chair before the broadcast cut entirely. In footage distributed by the president’s Justice and Development party (AKP), shot in the same location, Erdoğan explains that he contracted stomach flu following intense work on the campaign trail weeks before the pivotal election. He later tweeted: “Today I will rest at home upon the advice of my doctors … with God’s permission, we will continue our campaign from tomorrow onwards.” The vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said he would attend campaign events across central Turkey in his place. Turkey is holding parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May, when Erdoğan faces a concerted challenge from a six-party opposition striving to unseat him after 20 years in power. Many polls give his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a slight lead, amid discontent with an ongoing economic crisis and the government’s response to deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, and 8,000 in Syria. Erdoğan cancelled personal appearances at a number of high-profile campaign events due to his sudden illness, including attending the opening ceremony of part of a Russian-funded nuclear power plant in southern Turkey and a nearby rally. The nuclear plant is the latest flagship infrastructure project that Erdoğan and the AKP are hoping will sway voters at the upcoming election, despite concerns about the relationship between government-led construction projects and collapsed infrastructure following the earthquake. The AKP deputy chair, Erkan Kandemir, said Erdoğan would attend the ceremony at the nuclear power plant via video link. “Our president will attend the Akkuyu nuclear power plant ceremony, which is planned to be held tomorrow, online. Our Mersin rally is planned to be held at a later date,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T17:19:13Z","webTitle":"Is it time to abandon the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Last week, Jacinda Ardern wrote of growing scepticism about the intention of the nuclear weapon states to ever implement their nuclear disarmament commitments under article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), despite the threat of nuclear catastrophe being greater than ever (The world stands on a nuclear precipice – we must avoid catastrophe, 24 August). That scepticism has been more than justified by the utter failure of the NPT review conference to agree even a weak final document, with fine words about their “unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals” but no commitment to physical steps towards that end. The primary blame has been laid on Russia, but it is shared by all of the nuclear-armed states. Russia was not alone in derailing this conference. It was fully aligned with the other NPT countries in actively preventing any meaningful commitment to advance nuclear disarmament, stop nuclear threats, or reduce nuclear risks from being included in the outcome document. For decades, those of us in the peace movement have pinned our hopes of averting Armageddon on article VI being implemented in “good faith”, but the latest setback is forcing a rethink. Should we abandon the NPT and go for direct action? Perhaps the only way to break the deadlock is for one of the major nuclear-armed powers to break ranks by declaring that nuclear weapons do not give security, but, on the contrary, their continued existence threatens all of us. Does anyone really believe that the immediate response from another nuclear weapon state would be: “Oh, good, now we can chuck a nuke at X with impunity; let’s do it”? The first global leader who makes that declaration, really means it, and implements the necessary practical steps, will go down in history as the greatest statesperson of all time. Who will rise to that challenge? Frank Jackson Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign • New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was correct to call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but made no mention of closing off the route to more nations obtaining such weapons, which will require the elimination of nuclear power too. The Ukraine war has shown how close we might be to the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe, but has also made clear the danger inherent in ownership of nuclear power plants. The possibility of widespread radioactive pollution induced by the destruction of nuclear power stations during a war or act of terrorism was once seen as fanciful. However, events in Ukraine have shown that it is not (Revealed: Russian plan to disconnect Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from grid, 24 August). To tackle both these nuclear dangers requires two steps. Step one involves the reduction, then eventual elimination, of nuclear weapons, in a way that gives nuclear nations the confidence to do so. Jonathan Schell, in his book The Abolition, explained how to achieve this by what he termed “weaponless deterrence”. He proposed allowing nuclear states to keep the infrastructure to remake nuclear weapons should there be any verified threat of a new nation obtaining them. This approach will underpin global pressure to halt any aspiring nuclear nation, since such weapons are in the process of being negotiated away. The second step will be a parallel programme to eliminate nuclear power, since this is the likely source of such a spread.

In the race against time to avert dangerous global heating, the UK government has decided to back an untried reactor from Rolls Royce. The first of these could be “plugged into the grid by 2031”, according to Nuclear Industry Association. Internationally average planning time for reactor proposals is 10 years, plus another decade for building, and that is for already proven designs. The 16 planned Rolls Royce reactors are still on the drawing board. The arguments about where they could be sited are beginning. Apart from other possible objections the favoured UK coastal locations are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion and storms. Faced with the well-documented delays and drawbacks to nuclear programmes it is perhaps not surprising that there is no other country taking part in the Cop26 process in Glasgow relying on multiple new nuclear reactors to get to net zero carbon targets by 2050.

He looks a little haggard these days, like a homeless wizard: the face worn and weathered, a thick Arctic forest of a beard hanging from him. Deep breaths. Voice cracked and familiar. Baseball cap drawn low over sad eyes. On the walls at Liverpool’s training ground there are photos from his arrival, a younger and handsomer man staring him down every day he comes into work. Seven years. How has it only been seven years? How has it already been seven years? Somebody asks a question about Liverpool’s slow starts. Something about mentality. Suddenly he recognises a face, a name, some words, a feeling. A brief and powerful memory flickers and ignites inside him. “It’s really difficult to talk to you, if I’m 100% honest,” Klopp snapped at James Pearce, a Liverpool reporter from the Athletic, on Saturday night. “You know why. For all the things you wrote.” Of course Klopp’s outburst seems to have provoked all the usual trimmings of shock and outrage from all the usual places. Personally, I’m surprised this kind of thing doesn’t happen more often. Particularly when you consider the rawness of the emotions involved, the artificiality of the setting, the staggering gulf in expertise between those doing the asking and those doing the answering. Just pause for a second to consider how much more Klopp must know about his job than the average attendee at one of his press conferences. This is no slight on the football press, by the way: these are by definition quite different jobs with different functions, different target audiences, almost a different language. This largely explains why so many football press conferences produce so little of genuine intellectual value: the common ground between the interlocutors is so narrow as to be essentially meaningless. In which other profession are its ablest and brightest practitioners contractually obliged to take questions from the patently unqualified on an almost daily basis? Prof Andrew Wiles: congratulations on the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, do you think you’ve really laid down a marker there to the mathematical field? Big Fields medal announcement on Wednesday night, how important is it to get your hands on that first trophy of the year? Any knocks? Yet for all its inefficiency there remains a strange ritualistic power to the press conference, into which all its participants willingly buy. There are coaches for whom the press conference dais may as well be their pulpit: a piece of performance theatre as intrinsic to their brand as anything they do on a training pitch. There are journalists whose entire job revolves around press conferences: driving to them, waiting around for them to start, driving home from them. The little huddle after the press conference where everyone discusses what the best line was, who gets to use what when, and who transcribes which bits. Dave, I’ll do the first five minutes. Sparky, can I keep my answer back until Monday? Yeah, the one about “any special plans for James Maddison”. Yeah. Magic. If you’re on the inside of this world, there’s something luxuriously seductive to it, even as 24-hour news and social media nibble away at it from the outside. The game is gigantic and the show is global. But here in this windowless room on a cardboard campus in the middle of nowhere, there is a small piece of it that will forever be yours, some mid-strength embargoed Eddie Howe quotes burning a hole in your Olympus voice recorder. Of course, everyone has a chastening story or two. José Mourinho once blasted me on live television after a pointed question about Alexis Sánchez. Roy Keane rounded on me after I asked whether his turgid Ipswich side needed to lower their ambitions for the season. These are brief and fleeting moments when the fourth wall is broken, when the forced conviviality of this entire absurd encounter comes crashing down in flames. Because in essence the whole encounter is a kind of pantomime, a marketplace, a verbal arm-wrestle in which the protagonists have largely conflicting goals. The coach has a particular message they want to convey. They may have a score to settle. They may be intent on saying as little as possible. But they always have one big power differential over the rest of the room: while everyone is obliged to know who they are, they are not remotely obliged to know any of the faces in front of them. This is the compact Klopp broke so savagely on Saturday night. I don’t know Pearce, and I don’t know why Klopp has chosen to beef with one of the most loyal pro-Liverpool reporters in the business. But while coaches must occasionally read their own press – what is the point in having an ego that big unless you can stroke it every so often? – the pretence of oblivion must be maintained at all times. Klopp’s Liverpool were always based on control. Control of the ball and control of the transition, control of the science and control of the message. Yet among all his other problems, Klopp has lost a lot of expertise in recent months, trusted colleagues and sounding boards: sporting director Michael Edwards, president Mike Gordon, director of research Ian Graham. The football is disappearing over a cliff and the club’s golden era with it. Perhaps the public flaying of Pearce was a kind of rallying cry, an attempt to unite his ailing squad around a common enemy. Paradoxically, he has never really looked more alone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/apr/01/were-in-a-huge-mess-could-stevenage-woman-block-labours-path-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-01T15:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘We’re in a huge mess’: could ‘Stevenage Woman’ block Labour’s path to power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/01/were-in-a-huge-mess-could-stevenage-woman-block-labours-path-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/apr/01/were-in-a-huge-mess-could-stevenage-woman-block-labours-path-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, the author EM Forster and composer Elizabeth Poston are all featured on Stevenage’s wall of fame along the walkway between the station and town centre. But missing from the Hertfordshire town’s dedication to its famous residents is anyone by the name of “Stevenage Woman”. However, a Labour thinktank believes that if the party heeds its advice, this mythical archetype – along with 2019’s “Workington Man”, who Labour is trying to win back from the Tories - is the key to regaining power in the next general election. According to Labour Together, this newly identified group of voters – also referred to as “disillusioned suburbans” in its report, Red Shift – is a full-time working mother of two in her early 40s. The group is not in poverty but battling stagnant wages and cost increases, the report, published today, says. Disengaged from daily politics, but “by nature a balancer”, the group leans towards social conservatism, is “a little to the left” on the economy and is “comfortable” with immigration, the report adds. In the last election, Stevenage Woman voted Conservative, but is now twice as likely to back Labour, the report predicts. “She’s not seeking radical or dramatic change, but she is worried about her life today, the state of public services, and life in her town.” The theory is that if Labour can win over this demographic group it could transform the electoral map. Stevenage is a bellwether constituency (it has backed the winner every time since its creation in 1983) . But what do its women think of this characterisation? “She’s the Stevenage woman!” said Helen O’Sullivan, 65, pointing to the fabric and haberdashery owner Pamela Waterman, 64, surrounded by rolls of fabric and boxes of buttons at Buttons and Bows in Stevenage Indoor Market. As a small business owner approaching pension age who describes her life as “pretty good”, in many ways Waterman diverges from the new voter archetype, but she said it might be accurate in others. “I probably didn’t vote in the last election to be truthful,” she said. “And I can see younger people being disinterested in politics per se. But I also think there’s a lot of positives here.” She does not usually follow politics, other than the issues that affect her business and family, but she will vote in the next election. “We’re in a huge mess at the moment. The country needs some direction.” But she hasn’t yet decided between Labour and Conservative, or made her mind up on Keir Starmer – although she does recall him visiting the market in 2020. Britain, she said, had become the “laughing stock of Europe and beyond” after the leadership of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. “Collectively we should be able to pull together and with some good leadership get back to some of what we had.” O’Sullivan, who is retired, plans to vote Labour as always. Iza Stuchlik, 40, a bakery owner, said the description of Stevenage Woman was inaccurate, offensive and patronising, with many women in the town earning higher salaries in London. “Stevenage is very varied. You can’t say ‘this is the type of woman that lives here’. That’s very unfair.” But when it comes to politics, she is apathetic. “I don’t feel I have the power,” she said. Report co-author Josh Simons, director of Labour Together, said the term Stevenage Woman was not intended to represent everyone in the town, but to “focus political attention on towns like Stevenage, which for too long have not got a proper hearing”. Tanjira Busbui, 45, a nail technician, had not heard of Starmer or the Labour party, but her colleague Kanya Buathong, 45, said he had a better reputation than Boris Johnson or the former health secretary Matt Hancock. “He [Starmer] came in here a couple of years ago in the market and he was quite nice.” Would she vote for him? “Yes.” Somewhat unfortunately, perhaps, the person Labour has charged with winning Stevenage, which has a population of about 90,000, is in fact a man. Conservative Stephen McPartland has held the seat since 2010 but has announced he will not stand again. Labour’s Kevin Bonavia, 45, moved to the town last year from south-east London, where he was previously a Lewisham councillor. But sitting in Stevenage town square, overlooked by a constructivist-style Grade II-listed clocktower, Karen Parker, 39, who is unemployed and a lifelong Conservative voter, said there was nothing Labour could say to win her vote. By her side, Hannah Ayles, also 39, would like to see a Johnson comeback. “He said it how it was.” More help was needed, she added, especially for those on benefits. “I’m signed off and trying to get from pay day to pay day. It doesn’t work.” Esther Ah Chin Kow, 72, a retired nurse, said she liked the town, but was worried about crime and said elderly people were afraid to go out at night. While Starmer lacked name recognition with many women the Observer spoke to, the sense of disillusionment referred to in the Labour Together report was rife. “I don’t really follow politics,” said Patience Marty, a clinical support worker who has lived in the town for 15 years. “I just buy my daily bread, go to work, go home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Why is the UK government backing nuclear power when onshore wind is so much better? | Alethea Warrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","fields":{"bodyText":"After Friday’s huge jump in energy costs, millions of people across the UK face a frightening future. Urgent measures are needed but, instead of taking action, the cabinet is absorbed in a pointless argument that wrongly pits the energy bill crisis against our climate commitments. In reality, the best way of bringing down bills is to get off gas for good. We can take immediate steps to stop using gas because the UK has clean energy sources that can get going quickly, and are cheap and popular – wind and solar in particular. But at a time when they should be powering up the UK with renewables, ministers have other ideas: suggesting deepening our reliance on fossils fuels by opening up more drilling in the UK; or labouring under the misapprehension that people would rather live near a nuclear power plant than a wind turbine. The government’s tug of war over onshore wind is particularly puzzling. Onshore wind is clean, cheap and extremely popular, with the government’s own polling showing support from four out of five people in the UK. Far from considering them an “eyesore” as some Tory MPs and ministers worry, a Survation poll last year found that people who live near existing windfarms are the most supportive of all. Yet a major cause of the past month’s delay in getting the energy strategy out appears to be the government’s utterly unfounded concern that people don’t like onshore wind, and their mistaken belief that removing the virtual ban on new wind projects in England would provoke huge resistance from Conservative voters. The government removed support for onshore wind in 2015 following pressure from a group of Conservative MPs, some of whom have since changed their minds, left parliament or moved on to other pet peeves. The dislike for visible renewable energy projects from a fraction of the Conservative backbenches has always been out of step with public opinion, which has been consistently behind renewable energy, including onshore wind. Even a decade ago, two-thirds of people supported onshore wind, with support steadily rising to the 80% at which it currently stands. The British public know that clean energy is the way out of this crisis but, as they watch their energy bills shoot up and face the dismal prospect of cold homes, all they can see is their government dithering and delaying on the clean energy sources that are the quickest and easiest solution. Instead of fixing this crisis with renewable energy, ministers are reportedly thinking of pursuing nuclear power. Ministers recently tried and failed to argue that onshore wind is too expensive, yet they seem quite happy to argue for bill payers to shoulder the cost of nuclear power, which is about twice as high per unit of electricity as onshore wind. Given the urgency with which we need to clean up our energy supply and cut energy bills, the sluggish timeframes for new nuclear power projects risk leaving people at the mercy of gas markets for far too long. Wind projects commissioned now can be up and running before the end of next year, while the most recent nuclear projects, announced in 2010, won’t produce any energy until 2026 at the earliest. It is hardly surprising that nuclear power is much less popular than onshore wind, with just a third of people thinking that nuclear power would be affordable and even fewer thinking it is safe. If the government believes that new nuclear plants will be an easier sell to people than onshore wind on cost or local impacts, they could be in for an unpleasant shock. Ministers who insist that the UK’s energy strategy must prioritise community consent are right. Now they must also recognise that any plan to rush forward with an unpopular, slow and expensive energy source, while keeping the brakes on clean, cheap and quick onshore wind, is unlikely to gain support. It is time for the government to start listening to what people actually want, which is appropriately placed renewable energy projects that support local people and the local environment and for communities to have a say on the infrastructure in their area. The energy strategy is a vital chance to make this a reality. If the government gets this wrong, we’ll be living in cold homes on a hot planet. If they get it right, this could be the last energy crisis we ever have.

Every weekday evening, tens of thousands of Filipinos, many living abroad, would tune in to listen to his news commentary and sharp humour. But on this evening, as Mabasa drove up to the entrance of his gated community where his studio is located in Las Piñas, Metro Manila, a motorbike began to trail him. Footage taken by a camera on the back of his car, and since released by police, shows two figures on the bike pulling up alongside him. Then gunshots can be heard. There’s a bang as Mabasa’s car slams into the vehicle in front. The motorbike turns and drives away. Mabasa was killed instantly. Mabasa, who was better known by his professional name, Percy Lapid, spent his 35-year career as a journalist highlighting corruption among the powerful. His killing has amplified calls for the authorities to finally act on the longstanding and deadly threats facing media workers in the Philippines. It also brought to light serious allegations of wrongdoing by some of the country’s most senior officials. The authorities say they have identified 160 persons of interest in relation to the killing, but they have focused on officials at the top of the country’s prison system. In November, investigators at the Philippine national police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) accused the bureau of corrections chief, Gerald Bantag, and his deputy security officer, Ricardo Zulueta of arranging the murder through prison inmates. Charges have not been filed in court. According to Eugene Javier, of the NBI, who announced the allegations at a press conference, investigators have uncovered “the unfortunate transformation of a pillar of justice, the correction pillar, into a deep, large-scale and systematic criminal organisation”. It was Mabasa’s “continued exposé of Bantag” that had driven the latter to organise the killing, Javier alleged. Killings of journalists are not uncommon in the Philippines, but justice for such attacks is. Of the 197 journalists killed since democracy was restored in 1986 after the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, close to 60 have led to convictions, said Jonathan de Santos, the chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines. “Often a prosecution in these cases is focused on the actual gunmen, the actual killers,” he said. It is highly unusual for the masterminds to be identified. Bantag, who was appointed by the former president Rodrigo Duterte, has denied any involvement, and has filed a motion for inhibition, claiming department of justice prosecutors lack impartiality and should not be involved in the case. He has accused the justice secretary, Jesus Crispin Remulla, of having political ambitions and trying to use the case to raise his own profile. Zulueta has, in comments given by his lawyer, also denied any wrongdoing. Remulla said the allegations against the pair were based on the “totality” of evidence gathered, including testimonies by the self-confessed gunman – who alleged a prison inmate was a middle man in the killing – prisoners, Facebook messages and bank records. In the aftermath of Mabasa’s killing, his family, including his six children and four grandchildren, have avoided going outside, fearing further attacks. His brother, Roy Mabasa, has stayed at a different location each night and travels in borrowed cars to avoid being followed. The family were offered police protection but declined. “At this moment, we don’t know yet who our real enemies are,” Roy said. Threats of violence Born in Manila in 1959, Percy Mabasa grew up under the rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and he was a teenager when the late dictator imposed martial law, one of the darkest periods in the country’s modern history, when thousands were tortured, killed or jailed. Newspapers, radio stations and TV stations were closed, causing huge numbers of journalists, including Mabasa’s father, a radio commentator, to lose their jobs. Mabasa’s father left the city to avoid the authorities, and the family survived on the mother’s income from selling food at a market. “It was probably those upbringings that made us aware of injustices and what is good for the country,” Roy said. Throughout Mabasa’s career, his belief in calling out wrongdoing never wavered, but it came at a cost. “In the span of 35 years, he was removed by radio stations nearly 100 times because of his brand of commentary,” said Roy. Each time Mabasa challenged a powerful person, that person would call the station and ask for him to be sacked. “Libel was like breakfast, lunch and dinner for Percy. I knew the agony looking at his face. He considered it as part of the job,” said Roy. There were also threats of violence – though over the past decade, he tended not to talk about these, perhaps fearing that his children would worry, added Roy. According to Remulla, Bantag may have been motivated by one of Mabasa’s recent reports – an exposé alleging that an official from the justice department was leading a luxurious lifestyle. “There are more damaging commentaries Percy made on other people,” said Roy. Many of his commentaries targeted Duterte, who was not included on the list of 160 people cited as being of interest to the police, said Roy. A broken system Since Mabasa’s death, calls for reform have grown. The killing has brought into focus the flaws in the Philippines’ penal system, including how a lack of resources and severe overcrowding can complicate relations between prison staff and inmates, creating the potential for exploitation. The president, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, while acknowledging that investigations were ongoing, accused Bantag of having established his “own fiefdom” inside New Bilibid prison. After Bantag’s suspension, weapons, alcohol, methamphetamine and mobile phones were discovered inside the prison. It emerged that a large pit had been dug close to his quarters, and a menagerie of horses, game fowl and snakes was being kept onsite. Bantag has told local media he was building a swimming pool to train prison staff in scuba diving so they could help with rescue efforts during bad weather. The horses were used to travel through the compound, while the snakes were used for pest control, he said. He maintains he has been unfairly targeted. His fight, he said recently, “is for the small and ordinary Filipino”, adding: “If they can do this to me, then [they can do] much more to the small folk.” Roy hopes that whoever was the real mastermind behind Mabasa’s killing will be brought to justice, and that his brother’s death will finally prompt broader action to protect journalists in the Philippines. The deaths of all other journalists killed since the fall of Marcos Sr should be investigated, he said. Libel laws that have been used repeatedly to harass journalists through the courts, including the Nobel prize winner Maria Ressa, who faces decades in prison for her journalism, should also be re-examined. “The death of Percy should be an eye-opener to all our politicians. There is no more time for us to put everything under the rug every time that a journalist is being killed,” said Roy. “Now is the time to act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T10:59:55Z","webTitle":"March of the unicorns: Israel’s tech sector rebels against Netanyahu ‘power grab’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","fields":{"bodyText":"About 20 years ago, the skyline of Tel Aviv began to change. The city’s collection of elegant white Bauhaus buildings has been joined by tower after tower, each one a salute to Israel’s rapid transformation into one of the world’s most important advanced technology centres. It is no accident that the rise of the “startup nation” has dovetailed with the career of its longest serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, as he is widely known, is a firm believer in the free market and has championed Israel’s vaunted hi-tech sector as his own personal achievement. At 15.3% of GDP, it is now Israel’s main engine of economic growth, employing 10% of the country’s salaried workforce, and generating about a quarter of income taxes. Which perhaps makes it all the more surprising that the tech sector is now rebelling against the prime minister over government proposals to neuter the Israeli judiciary. Spooked by predictions of the end of democracy and the rule of law, Israel’s entrepreneurial class, previously seemingly immune to the political weather, has joined the hundreds of thousands of people striking and marching as part of the country’s biggest ever protest movement. The protests on Thursday hit the arrival of US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as thousands of Israelis opposed to the government’s legal reform plans blocked roads in and around Ben Gurion airport, forcing an eleventh hour change of venue for Austin’s talks. There are increasing signs too the famously resilient tech sector is under pressure. A recent report by the Israeli business publication Calcalist suggested that 85bn shekels (£20bn) in capital has been taken out of Israel in the two months since the new government was sworn in and the shekel was the world’s third worst-performing currency in February, falling to a three-year low against the dollar. Economists globally have predicted a possible downgrade of Israel’s credit rating – unwelcome news for the hi-tech sector, which by some estimates is 90% funded by outside investors. A handful of industry leaders have been vocal about moving funding outside the country, while many more appear to have done so quietly. Eynat Guez, the CEO and co-founder of Papaya Global, a payroll software “unicorn” worth more than $1bn, was the first to publicly do so in January. “This is beyond left or right, it’s that the reforms are simply a power grab,” she said. “We live in a dangerous neighbourhood, and despite that we have built this industry and gained investor trust. “If this is the end of the tech industry in Israel – not because of the economy, because of politics – it will take a decade for anyone to forgive and forget that. It will destroy the economic future of the next generation.” Netanyahu returned to office in December at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history. Various elements of the coalition wish to annex the occupied West Bank, roll back pro-LGBTQ+ legislation, limit freedom of speech and give the Knesset the power to appoint supreme court judges and overturn the court’s decisions. Proponents say it is necessary to fix the balance of power across different branches of the state, and counter a perceived leftwing bias in the court’s rulings. Critics point out the changes would help the prime minister evade a conviction in his corruption trial, in which he denies all charges, and undermine democratic norms in a country with no formal constitution. Despite the protests, and polling that shows the vast majority of the public are against the judicial changes in their current form, the government appears to be rushing towards passing the legislation before the Knesset’s winter session ends for the Passover holiday in a few weeks’ time. Israeli media reported on Tuesday that the president, Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, had been pushing the government and the opposition towards a compromise that would “soften” the proposals, a plan expected to be made public in the next few days. For many of those opposed to the government’s plans, however, compromise is not a welcome prospect. “You can’t compromise on a coup,” Guez said. “Pilots are saying they won’t serve [in the military], doctors are striking. We love Israel and want to defend it. That doesn’t mean you just obey the people currently in charge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/26/proof-if-needed-where-political-power-goes-newspapers-soon-follow","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T09:31:16Z","webTitle":"Proof, if needed, that where political power goes, newspapers will soon follow | Torsten Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/proof-if-needed-where-political-power-goes-newspapers-soon-follow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/proof-if-needed-where-political-power-goes-newspapers-soon-follow","fields":{"bodyText":"What you consume media wise affects your politics – each Observer or Guardian article probably makes you that little bit more of a lefty liberal. But do political motives, determine how many, and which, newspapers are on offer in the first place? High-profile owners with clear agendas mean most of us suspect the answer is yes, but I’ve never seen rigorous evidence to prove it. That is until now, with a Warwick University study. It examines the case of India, the world’s largest democracy, which has a booming newspaper market of well over 100,000 publications. Back in the 00s, the electoral landscape for state legislature elections was redrawn to reflect the latest census, with some districts gaining and others losing representatives. Since that hadn’t been done since 1974, despite significant population shifts, it meant big changes to the relative electoral importance of some districts over others. The districts that were politically important changed almost overnight. What happened in areas that became more important? They saw more, and higher circulation of, papers in the following years as owners reacted to changes in the political landscape. The impact was greatest on local language journals, which are more likely to cover the ins and outs of local politics. Now obviously, political motives are far from everything when it comes to newspapers – profit plays its part. Yet the researchers estimate that 12-18% of newspaper circulation after the electoral changes was because of politics. So you can read this research to be convinced that those controlling our media aren’t exactly disinterested in controlling our politics. Or maybe you don’t need to. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. Read more at resolutionfoundation.org Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Closing the conference of 46 European leaders held at a castle 12 miles (19km) from the border with Ukraine, the country’s president spoke of the importance of overturning Russian’s supremacy in the air with a “sky shield” involving a combination of Patriot missiles and F-16s. He also won support from Rishi Sunak in his battle for accelerated membership of Nato. “Why Patriots? Because Patriots have shown the world they can take down any kind of Russian missiles. Our proposal is to build a sky shield over the European continent. It’s important to build it for the whole of Europe, starting with our territory,” he told reporters at the European political summit in Chișinău. After an 11-year-old and her mother and another woman were killed in overnight missile attacks on Kyiv, Zelenskiy said the “protection of our skies” was vital because it would first and foremost protect the people of Ukraine and “our children”. Several countries, including the UK, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium, have said they want to help procure F-16s for Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, endorsed training programmes last month for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s, but the training will take months to complete and western countries have not yet said they will supply the jets. Senior sources involved in the F-16 coalition said the jets could be operational in six months’ time and be useful during the war or as a stabilising factor in a postwar scenario. The Dutch and Polish prime ministers progressed the timeline for delivery of the planes during a roundtable discussion that also included their Danish, Belgian, Norwegian and Swedish counterparts. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the meeting had gone very well. “We agreed to train Ukrainian pilots. Of course the UK does not have F-16s, but you have fighter jets and Rishi Sunak agreed to participate in the training exercise for Ukrainian pilots, training also for the logistics around these F-16s, the maintenance, introducing them to the Ukrainian aircraft system. We all agreed the next steps.” Russia has said that providing Ukraine with F-16s would be a “colossal risk” for western nations. The Moldova conference gave Zelenskiy an opportunity to see most of his main allies in one afternoon after he drove to the summit from an overnight visit to Odesa. Sunak said: “I agree with the Nato secretary general that Ukraine’s rightful place is in Nato and what we are also talking to Ukraine about right now is making sure they have all the support they need for a successful counteroffensive.” The British prime minister said he was proud of the UK’s record in supporting Ukraine. “We want to make sure we put in place security arrangements for Ukraine for the long term, so we send a very strong signal to Vladimir Putin that we are not going anywhere, we are here to stay and we will continue backing Ukraine – not just now but for years into the future,” he said. Zelenskiy’s plea for security guarantees for his country and Moldova came 24 hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had called on the international community to make a “tangible and credible” offer. Such guarantees were in the rest of the continent’s interest, he said. “We have to build something between the security provided to Israel and full-fledged membership,” he said. Zelenskiy did not give details of the proposal but said he was in talks with “the US and other partners about the security guarantees compact”. “We do we need them because we are not in Nato. If we were, Russia would not attack us”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/22/morning-mail-exclusive-investigation-into-sydney-housing-spread-hive-of-spies-exposed-putins-nuclear-move","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T19:50:52Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: exclusive investigation into Sydney housing spread, ‘hive of spies’ exposed, Putin’s nuclear move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/22/morning-mail-exclusive-investigation-into-sydney-housing-spread-hive-of-spies-exposed-putins-nuclear-move","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/22/morning-mail-exclusive-investigation-into-sydney-housing-spread-hive-of-spies-exposed-putins-nuclear-move","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning, everyone.

António Guterres also said the impact of the conflict could cause a food supply crisis next year. “Simply put the world will run out of food,” he said. Guterres was speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, announcing a partial mobilisation and threatening the use of nuclear weapons “if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened”. Putin also approved referendums in four Ukrainian regions intended to pave the way for annexation, raising the prospect that he would then deem Ukrainian operations to recapture them as a threat to Russia’s “territorial integrity”. The US president, Joe Biden, rejected the nuclear threat as reckless, and Ukraine’s backers said they would not be deterred from providing military support. “The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate. This in itself is totally unacceptable,” Guterres said. “I’m also deeply concerned by reports of plans to organise so-called referenda in areas of Ukraine that are not currently under government control,” he said. “Any annexation of a state’s territory by another state resulting from a threat or use of force is a violation of the UN charter and of international law.” Russia was widely condemned at Thursday’s security council meeting chaired by the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, repeated Beijing’s line that the UN charter and territorial integrity must be supported, without directly criticising Russia, which is an ally. Wang did not, however, offer Moscow any rhetorical support in a carefully worded address. The council was briefed by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan, on the investigation of mass graves found in Ukrainian towns liberated from Russian occupation. Khan said the “echoes of Nuremberg should be heard today”, invoking the precedent set by the war crimes trials of the Nazis. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, did not address Guterres’s comment, repeating Moscow’s discredited claims that Ukraine was being run by “neo-Nazis” and the war had been caused by mistreatment of Russian speakers in the Donbas. He said Russia had no confidence in the ICC. Lavrov was not in the chamber for the ministers who spoke before him, and left as soon as he had delivered his own address. The expansion of Russian conscription, initially intended to draft 300,000 soldiers, has triggered protests around Russia and an exodus of military-age men. Putin’s escalation of the war in the face of territorial losses to Ukrainian forces has led to a new round of sanctions being considered. EU foreign ministers agreed in Brussels to prepare a new package expected to include broad economic and individual measures. Guterres also pointed to the success of the UN-brokered Black Sea grain initiative in exporting more than 4.3m tonnes of food, as a result of which he said food prices had dropped sharply. But he said a drop in Russian exports of fertiliser and ammonia was creating already causing shortages in West Africa and elsewhere. “If the fertiliser market is not stabilised next year it could bring the food supply crisis,” he said. In his speech on Wednesday Biden said that food and fertiliser were not subject to international sanctions. “Let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow – explicitly allow – Russia the ability to export food and fertiliser. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it,” he said. Speaking at Thursday’s security council session, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said similar and blamed Moscow for the crisis. “Let us be clear, we are not sanctioning food,” he said. “It is Russia’s actions that are preventing food and fertiliser getting to developing countries. It is Russia’s tactics and bombs that are to blame for destroying Ukraine’s farms infrastructure and delaying its exports.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T05:48:53Z","webTitle":"Jellyfish have a proud history of ruining nuclear power plants all over the world | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","fields":{"bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-16T10:14:08Z","webTitle":"Shetland residents still without power as engineers battle snow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","fields":{"bodyText":"Hundreds of homes on Shetland face being without power until early next week as engineers battle tough road and weather conditions, five days after last Monday’s widespread blackout. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, which has shipped in 125 emergency engineers, convoys of 4x4s and mobile generators to Shetland this week, said it could take until at least Monday to restore supplies to about 800 homes and businesses in West Mainland. Their warning came as a large part of west central Scotland and parts of the southern Highlands were placed under an amber severe weather warning for snow until midday on Friday, with forecasts that up to 20cm could fall on higher ground. The runway at Glasgow airport was closed for several hours this morning for a clear-up operation to remove ice and snow, causing significant disruption to flight schedules. After midday, the Met Office issued a new yellow warning for ice, covering the Dumfries, Galloway, Lothian and Borders, and Strathclyde weather areas and running through the night until 10.30am on Saturday. The amber alert was issued by the Met Office just before 5am and only an hour before it came into force, leaving many commuters and commercial drivers little time to prepare. Traffic agencies and police reported a series of collisions, numerous breakdowns and impassable roads before and during rush hour, including the closure of parts of the M8 east of Glasgow after an accident and reports of vehicles stuck in snow near Inveraray, Argyll. Police in mid Argyll and Kintyre, west of Loch Lomond, advised all motorists to stay clear of the A83 and A85 trunk roads due to the heavy snow and reports of vehicles getting stuck, including an HGV on the notorious Rest and Be Thankful stretch of the A83. SSEN said that by 10.45pm on Thursday, about 1,700 properties were still without power in parts of West Mainland, Voe and Brae. “Helicopter surveys and foot patrols have now provided engineers with a clear picture of the extent of the damage, enabling teams to segment the network and make progress in restoring customer supplies area by area,” the company said. “This work has been essential to the rebuilding of the ‘backbone’ of the network. “Subject to no unforeseen challenges, we expect sustained progress over the next 48 hours and are targeting the restoration of the large majority of supplies by Sunday. “Given the extent of damage and access issues in the West Mainland, particularly west of Bixter, it is now anticipated that some properties in this area will be reconnected by the early part of next week. We are continuing to make every effort to improve on this if we can.” Shetland Islands council, SSEN, the police and other agencies have set up 20 “warm hubs” to offer hot drinks, kitchen facilities, fuel, broadband connections and a heated space for those without power. Dr Susan Bowie, the GP at Hillswick surgery in north-west Mainland, told BBC Scotland they had no heating: “It’s really cold at the surgery. You can’t stay there too long because your hands get so cold, but there’s been a real community spirit about this situation. “The roads are terrible but the staff have come in, they have done their best. We are wearing coats, jumpers and fleeces just to stay warm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T15:30:51Z","webTitle":"Energy support for businesses to cost ‘tens of billions’, Rees-Mogg says; firms and schools fear cliff edge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time to recap…. Britain is facing tens of billions of pounds of extra borrowing to cover the cost of protecting businesses, public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals, and charities from the full force of the energy crisis. The UK government announced it will cap wholesale electricity and gas costs for non-domestic users at less than half the market rate expected this winter from the start of October. The plan, two weeks after outlining protection for households, could avert a winter catastrophe for businesses. The package will only initially last for six months – with further help potentially to be offered to vulnerable firms and organisations that need more support beyond March. Under the plan, wholesale prices for electricity are expected to be capped at 21.1p/kWh, while gas would be capped at 7.5p/kWh – for those on existing fixed price contracts. Those on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs, up to a maximum amount. Analysts at Cornwall Insight said the move would effectively reset the market back to last spring’s price levels, before the surge in wholesale energy prices this summer as Russia tightened the screw on Europe. They estimate it will cost £25bn. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan would “stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs and limit inflation,”. But the announcement, in a press release, meant MPs were not able to quiz ministers about the plan. Costing details could come in Friday’s mini-budget. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told broadcasters that the final cost of the scheme would “unquestionably” run into “tens of billions” of pounds, but couldn’t give a precise amount – as it all depends how high electricity and gas prices rise this winter. Investec estimate the plan could cost up to £48bn. Business groups broadly welcomed the plan, saying it would help firms keep running through the winter. But several groups warned that further help will be needed; Make UK, the manufacturers’ trade body, warned prices could “remain high for many months to come”. Labour warned that the plan came too late for some businesses, saying the delay in providing support was ‘farcical’. The package has also been criticised for not being better targeted. As Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee Chair Darren Jones put it: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” However, Resolution Foundation points out that companies on long-term contracts, paying less than the government’s new cap, won’t quality for savings – reducing the total cost. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said a six-month cap made it “impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence”. Hospitality firms, nurseries and breweries all warned that ministers are creating a cliff edge in March 2023, when the cap will end. Councils in England and Wales said they needed more help to get them though the cost of living crisis. Here’s the full story: And a detailed explainer: In other news… The UK borrowed almost twice as much as expected in August, at over £11.8bn, as soaring inflation pushed up the cost of index-linked debt. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, at just $1.1325. The foreign exchange markets were shaken by Vladimir Putin who has ordered Russia’s first military mobilisation since World War Two, and accused the West of nuclear blackmail. The government has been warned that cuts to stamp duty will hurt first-time buyers and stoke an inflationary bubble in the property market – following reports that Liz Truss is planning to lower the tax to encourage growth. Economists have called for a shake-up of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee…. … which is expected to announce another increase in UK interest rates tomorrow. Could we see the biggest rise since the late 1980s? The BoE is also been urged to condemn the government’s move to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses – given its previous calls for wage restraint. The GMB union argued that governor Andrew Bailey should speak out, asking; “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The energy crisis has forced Germany to nationalise its biggest gas importer, Uniper, to avert a crisis as it battles energy shortages resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer is increasing staff pay for the second time this year and providing 4,500 employees with a £250 shopping voucher as part of a £15m package to help with the rising cost of living. In a grim development, more than 5 million Britons have gone without food, according to new research that reveals people are skipping meals “just to keep the lights on”. Nearly 11 million people are now behind on their bills, the Money Advice Trust reported. Online gambling firm Betway has been fined more than £400,000 after its marketing material was found on the children’s section of the West Ham United website, including a page where young fans were invited to colour in a teddy bear. And French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone…which could herald a shake-up at the mobile giant. Over in New York, Liz Truss has told executives at a business roundtable in New York that boosting the City of London will help to level up the UK. Truss argued that promoting the financial sector (where the government controversially wants to lift the cap on bonuses) will actually help the rest of the country. She said: We want the City to be the most competitive place for financial services in the world, and we see that as a key part of the levelling up agenda, because when we unblock capital, that capital will be used across the UK to make every industry become more productive and competitive. Andy Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has all the details: Financial service group Investec have estimated that the non-domestic price cap could cost anywhere between £22bn and £48bn. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield explains: In the absence of official numbers, our utilities team tentatively suggest a range of £22bn-£48bn as a cost for the non-domestic energy support package over its initial six-month period. Adding this to what may be a price tag of close to £90bn for household energy bill support, as per our utilities analyst, it is clear that the government is prepared to commit substantial amounts of government funding to provide support with surging energy prices. To put these figures into context, furlough for employees and the self-employed cost £97bn, close to 4% of GDP. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, warns that the UK still faces a recession, despite the government’s energy support. Pugh agrees that non-domestic customers face a cliff edge next spring, which will deter firms from investing. Energy prices for businesses were only frozen for six months at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 MWh for natural gas. Given that electricity prices in April 2023 are currently around £360 per MWh, this could represent a cliff edge in spring after what will undoubtedly be an exceptionally tough winter. That risks productive investment being deferred or cancelled and otherwise viable firms going bust, making the economy permanently smaller. RSM estimates that the household energy bill freeze, announced a fortnight ago, means inflation will peak at 11% in October, not 15% in January as feared. That means a less severe recession: What’s more, the smaller impact on household incomes means that consumer spending will fall by less and the recession will be shallower. We’re now expecting a peak-to-trough drop of around 0.5% of GDP, down from 1.5%. Here’s a handy explanation about what today’s announcement means for business owners, and those running schools, hospitals and charities too: The plan to cap energy costs has also been welcomed by the steel industry, one of the energy-intensive sectors hit hard by soaring gas and electricity bills. Director General of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the cap will help industry get through the winter. “The Business Secretary’s announcement today demonstrates that this new Government understands the sheer scale of the issue and the need to deliver a significant solution swiftly. Setting a price cap for electricity at £211/MWh for six months gives foundation sectors, such as steel, the chance to get through the winter by giving us a competitive business landscape. The Government has clearly listened to sectors such as steel, estimated the enormity of the challenge that energy intensive sectors face, and today has delivered. The Resolution Foundation have given the energy package a fairly warm welcome – saying it’s well-targeted at tackling soaring bills. They argue it strikes the ‘right balance’ between tackling businesses’ soaring bills, while avoiding offering support for businesses who don’t need it [because their energy costs are still below the new price cap]. Emily Fry, Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Today’s welcome package of support for business strikes the right balance of preventing firms being hit with soaring bills this winter, while encouraging them to become more energy efficient, and avoiding giving support to firms on longer term energy contracts who frankly don’t need it. “Today’s package requires another large cheque from a government already grappling with higher borrowing. But, unlike with support for households, that cheque is not blank – reflecting limits on the size of the discount firms can receive. “Overall, the Government’s energy bills support package is welcome, but expensive, and could easily cost over £100 billion. The refusal to cover more of this cost with windfall and solidarity taxes will add pressure on the Bank of England to up the pace and scale of interest rate rises, which will start to be felt by mortgagors in the months ahead.” The Bank of England could hit borrowers with more financial pain tomorrow, when it announces its latest interest rate move (almost certainly a sharp rise). Trading in financial markets reflects an 80% probability of a 0.75 percentage point increase, which would mark the biggest single rate increase since 1989, when inflation was soaring during a consumer boom before the onset of the early 1990s recession. However, experts said the Bank pushing ahead with the biggest rate hike for more than three decades would mean an extra £3.1bn of interest payments for borrowers on standard variable rate and tracker mortgages. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “For anyone who is already struggling with runaway price rises, the extra cost of the mortgage could be the final straw.” Our economics correspondent Richard Partington has the full story: After some choppy sessions recently, stocks have opened higher in New York ahead of tonight’s US interest rate decision. The S&amp;P 500 – a broad index of US companies – is 0.4% higher, up 15 points at 3,871. Investors are expecting another hefty rise in US interest rates from the Federal Reserve – quite possibly the third 75bp rise (three quarters of a percent) in a row, or even a full percentage point rise. Local councils are welcoming the six month energy price guarantee – but warning that they, too, need further help to get through the cost of living crisis. Cllr Andrew Western, chair of the resources board at the Local Government Association, says capping gas and electricity costs (at around half the expected levels this winter) is a ‘positive step’. The LGA says councils have been hit by soaring prices – pushing up the cost of running and repairing street lighting, filling potholes and building new roads Western explains: “Alongside energy bills, councils are also facing massive increases in costs due to spiralling inflation and National Living Wage increases both this year and in future years. This is forcing councils to reset budgets leading to cuts to local services just to meet their legal duty to balance the books. “Further government support will be needed by councils and residents to cope with these ongoing pressures and to protect the services that our communities rely on every day and will be vital to help residents cope through the cost-of-living crisis.” UK brewers are also concerned by the looming ‘cliff edge’ at the end of next March. Roy Allkin Chairman of the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) says the sector has suffered from soaring energy bills: Many independent brewers have been hit hard by the recent spikes in energy prices and today’s bold step will give them six months of headroom. However given the uncertainty in the energy markets, there is a danger that a cliff edge will be created next year and serious questions remain about the criteria being used to identify the most vulnerable businesses that will be eligible for further support. The debate on banker bonuses is heating up ahead of Friday’s mini-budget, with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey now under pressure to denounce plans to scrap the cap on bumper payouts. Kalyeena Makortoff, our banking correspondent explains… You’ll remember that Bailey was repeatedly criticised for suggesting workers should hold back from asking for pay rises, amid fears that it could further fuel inflation. He originally said in February: ‘We do need to see restraint in pay bargaining otherwise it will get out of control.’ But GMB union general secretary Gary Smith says Bailey risks setting a double-standard unless he takes a stance against scrapping the cap - a move which is widely expected to be confirmed on Friday. The current cap was part of post-financial crisis reforms introduced by the EU in 2016, and meant bankers were limited to bonuses worth two times their salaries. (More here for context) In a letter to Bailey, Smith says: “The Prime Minister has stated she supports plans to scrap the cap on bankers’ bonuses. To my mind, this will rightly be seen as a gratuitous insult to workers who are being told by you and others to tighten their belts.” Smith goes on to ask whether Bailey will stand by his comments about restraints in pay bargaining, adding: “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The GMB boss also reiterates his offer for Bailey to shadow a low-paid care worker, saying that: “It would also be a good opportunity for you to explain directly, if this is your view, why the Bank of England thinks there should be one rule for bankers and another for care workers.” It remains to be seen whether Bailey chooses to take on the banker bonus battle, given he’s also facing a crisis of independence, with the government threatening to introduce powers that would allow politicians to intervene in regulatory matters. The Unite union has dubbed the energy support package a taxpayer funded ‘panic measure’. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The government plans are a short term taxpayer funded panic measure. Although they will give business some respite on soaring energy bills in the short term, employers are crying out for long-term solutions in order to be able to plan with confidence for the future. “Yet again the taxpayer is being required to pick up the tab, with no check or penalty being placed on the excessive profits being generated by the energy companies who will be laughing all the way to the bank.” Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Live blog is also covering the political reaction to today’s support package – including warnings that it comes too late for some companies: The chair of parliament’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, has criticised the government for not targetting its support at businesses and organisations who most needed the help. Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, says: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” British manufacturers expect the biggest drop in production since the start of last year over the next three months, as economic storm clouds darken. The Confederation of British Industry’s regular healthcheck on the sector shows that factory bosses are increasingly pessimistic about the outlook – showing the urgent need for today’s energy support package. The difference between manufacturers who expect a rise in output over the next three months, and those who expect a fall dropped to -17% in September, from -2 in August. That’s the lowest since during the Covid lockdowns of January 2021. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said the economic outlook has deteriorated: “It is clear that the downturn, which originated in consumer-facing services, has spread to manufacturing, with output falling for the second month running. When adding an uncertain demand environment to ongoing input and labour shortages, and a cost-of-doing-business crisis, the outlook looks increasingly challenging for the sector. “If the country is going to fulfil the government’s ambitious plans to supercharge economic growth, businesses need the confidence and the capital to invest. The announcement of support on energy bills is a good first step, and the CBI looks forward to working in lockstep with the Government going forward.” Meanwhile in the City….French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone, citing opportunities to accelerate a “streamlining” of the London-listed group’s business. Niel, who founded the telecoms company Iliad, has taken the stake through his investment vehicle Atlas Investissement. My colleague Mark Sweney has the full story: The big question is whether this marks the start of further stake building and what Niel plans to do with his increasing share of the company, explains Victoria Scholar of Interactive Investor: Niel is a veteran in the telecoms industry with vast experience through his majority shareholding in Iliad, which he took private last year. Vodafone shares are trading at depressed levels, down more than 20% since the February highs, providing an attractive entry point for Niel. Since 2015, investors have had a rough ride with the stock which is down by almost 60% from the peak and losses have accelerated over the last month. Vodafone has been struggling this year with the pressures from inflation, in particular with rising energy costs. There can be no starker contrast between how the two political parties are judged on economic policy than the way the past fortnight has played out for Liz Truss, our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot writes: The astonishing scale of state spending to relieve the energy crisis and enable tax cuts has been announced with total omertà thus far on how much the proposals will cost the British taxpayer. One Labour shadow cabinet minister observed this week that they had been irritated by an interview with Rishi Sunak earlier in the leadership contest on how he would fund his own energy crisis package – costing a mere £15bn – where he had admitted at least £10bn would come from borrowing. “We’d have been crucified for that,” the shadow cabinet minister observed. “But since then we’ve had the new PM announce hundreds of billions and refused to say anything at all.” The energy package for business announced on Wednesday also has no detail on the anticipated costs of discounting wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools…. Here’s the full analysis: The cost of living crisis has prompted Marks &amp; Spencer to raise its pay rates for the second time this year. M&amp;S will lift the hourly pay rate formore than 40,000 workers to a minimum of £10.20 from October 1st, as part of a £15m package. The additional autumn pay review, a first for M&amp;S, follows an initial pay increase in April to £10/hour, from £9.50. Combined, this represents an annual raise of 7.4% – while UK inflation was 9.9% in August. M&amp;S is also giving 4,500 salaried staff on pre-management levels a one-off £250 M&amp;S voucher, and offering a free meal per shift for staff at its Distribution Centre in Castle Donington. This month, M&amp;S also introduced free sanitary products to colleagues across all stores and sites. The government will set out the cost of capping energy prices for households and businesses in Friday’s mini-budget, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Liz Truss said. Reuters has the details: The government pledged on Wednesday to cap electricity and gas costs for businesses at less than half the market rate. The finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng plans to make a fiscal statement on Friday to explain his plans to support households and businesses through the coming winter. “Costs will be set out in the expected fiscal event on Friday,” Truss’s spokeswoman told reporters. The chancellor is expected to unveil tax cuts of £30bn to £50bn, according to some estimates, while the government’s intervention to freeze energy prices for consumers and businesses could cost more than £100bn. (although, as Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out earlier, the final bill depends on the energy market). Kwarteng has also refused to let the government’s fiscal watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts: Here’s a clip of Jacob Rees-Mogg announcing today’s six-month support package via video – rather than to MPs in the House of Commons, where he’d be questioned about the details (incuding the cost!). He explains how the package will help businesses, charities, and public sector organisations including schools, nurseries, hospitals and care homes. Rees-Mogg says the package will help keep high streets ‘humming this winter, and beyond’ – although, as we flagged earlier, there’s a boarded-up shop next to the business secretary, out of shot…. Businesses have been given an emergency package of government support including a cap significantly reducing the price paid for energy from 1 October to help them get through the winter, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson explains: The UK government has stepped in to discount wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools. Under the plan, they will be given support for six months to protect them from soaring bills. Further help will be offered to companies in vulnerable industries after that. The business department has announced a “supported wholesale price” expected to be £211 a megawatt hour for electricity and £75 a MWh for gas, which it said would be less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter. The cap means that electricity prices for business customers will still be about double what they were in October 2021, when the price per megawatt hour was £117, but more than half the forecast winter prices of about £540. The scheme limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas and electricity. Businesses will not need to take any action, as the discounts will be automatically applied to their bills. The changes will apply to new contracts from 1 October, and to fixed contracts taken out since 1 April. Here’s Alex’s full story: This chart shows how the government’s price cap will protect businesses, public sector groups such as schools, and charities from the surge in electricity bills this winter: Asked about the impact on government borrowing, Jacob Rees-Mogg says the support package will reduce the interest bill on index-linked UK debt. That’s because it will lower inflation, which is used to set the repayment cost on gilts linked to the RPI measure of rising prices, he explains. [we learned this morning that interest payments on the national debt hit a record in August, due to high inflation]. Rees-Mogg agreees there will be a cost to today’s package, but argues this burden should be borne collectively on the balance sheet that can bear it. Rees-Mogg adds that today’s business support package only last for six months due to the complexity of the non-domestic energy market. Today’s package will give people confidence through the winter, he argues. The package will be reviewed in three months time to check the government is giving support in the right places, and to ensure that continued support “if that’s necessary’ is directed where it is needed, the business secretary adds. That sounds like a hint that some of the groups covered by today’s announcement, such as schools, hospitals and care homes as well as the hospitality sector, could get more support beyond next March. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the energy support package will cost ‘tens of billions’ of pounds, but can’t give a precise estimate – as it will depend on the wholesale energy market. Rees-Mogg has told Sky News that the caps on gas and electricity announced today will be a ‘huge support’ for businesses, to ensure they can cope with the rise in energy prices caused by Putin’s war in Ukraine. He adds: The difficulty with giving you a cost figure is that this will depend on where the price of energy goes over the winter, and that’s very difficult to forecast. I can’t give you an absolute cost, but we are talking about many billions of pounds. It will be into the tens of billions, unquestionably. Some businesses are looking for more support from the government – warning that the cost of living crisis could also hit takings. Paul Cook, 50, a director at the Angry Parrot pub, told PA Media that the energy cap won’t make a difference if people can’t afford to visit pubs, clubs and hospitality venues. He added: “VAT is always a killer, if we could reduce that that would be more than welcome. It’s all about cash flow for us. Any scrapping of business rates for the remainder of the year, that would be more than welcome. “This support’s only for six months, and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but what’s going to happen after those six months? Will it be enough to turn it all around? We need to make sure the public has disposable income. Cook warned that business had already deteriorated: “Trade for us has already dropped off probably by about 40% in the past month. We’re looking towards the Christmas period and hoping this could help to kickstart things, but I don’t know.” The new cap applies to businesses on existing fixed price contracts signed since April 1st, and on any new fixed contracts taken out from 1st October. Firms on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs – but that will be capped, so they could end up paying more if wholesale prices rise above the current expected levels. The early years sector also warned of the perils of a cliff edge in six months’ time and called for additional future support for nurseries which are closing “at an alarming rate”. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said: “Although capping energy costs will help give certainty over what will be a very difficult winter, it cannot lead to a cliff edge in six months’ time. “Childcare businesses – which have been closing at an alarming rate - are absolutely fundamental both for children’s development and for parental employment. Due to their importance and the risks they face, they must be classed as vulnerable, so they get additional future support.” The UK Green Building Council is urging the government to produce a strategy to cut the vast costly energy waste from the sector’s poorly insulated buildings – including through tax incentives. Shifting from gas and oil heating to more efficient, low carbon options, will also help give firms energy security. UKGBC’s Head of Policy &amp; Public Affairs, Louise Hutchins, explains: Measures such as VAT and business rates cuts for businesses investing in decarbonising their buildings and requiring companies to measure and publish their energy performance will all be needed if we are to get off the hook of high and volatile gas bills year on year. Labour have criticised the government for failing to provide help to businesses and other non-domestic users sooner, given the energy crisis has been building for months. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy, says some firms have already collapsed while waiting for support: “It is farcical that the Tories have been unable to tell businesses at the sharp end of the energy crisis what they plan to do to help them until now. Labour has been calling for support since the start of the year. “Businesses have been crying out for detail on these plans and, even now, there are still questions about how much this will cost and who will pay for it. “We have known a crisis of this scale has been coming for months and Conservative dither and delay has forced too many businesses to close, with the future still looking bleak. “While the Tories prioritise the profits of oil and gas producers, Labour will always be on the side of business and the jobs they create.” Today’s business energy support package to help firms through the winter will cost up to £25bn, the consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates. Robert Buckley, Cornwall’s head of relationship development, explains that the new caps on gas and electricity costs will mean substantial savings for non-domestic users. Effectively it takes the market back to the prices in spring this year, Buckley says (when the Ukraine war has already pushed up wholesale energy prices). “The reduction in energy costs will be substantial. As a proxy and noting the challenge of calculating a homogenous discount across so many contract types, this represents a 45% discount to closing wholesale energy prices as at the end of last week. The support effectively reverts the market back to where it was price wise in the Spring of 2022. Buckley adds: “Structuring this as fixed discounts on wholesale energy costs caps the cost of the scheme for government at around £25bn. There will also be a strong incentive for businesses to move from out of contract to negotiated contract terms, which acts to maintain the integrity of the market. This will be very important for what emerges after these six months have elapsed. The ICAEW, which represents chartered accountants, also fears a cliff-edge in six months time when the cap on non-domestic electricity and gas charges end. Businesses will need to know soon what happens when this support ends, and what to expect if there are energy shortages, warns Iain Wright, ICAEW’s managing director for reputation and influence: “Our members are playing a key role in both running companies facing increases in costs of doing business, as well as helping firms up and down the country deal with the fallout from the energy crisis but continued uncertainly makes it extremely difficult to plan. We hope the government continues to respond flexibly to provide support where needed, otherwise firms will face a cliff edge in six months’ time which can only mean price increases and real threats of company failures - feeding inflation, harming the economy and hurting consumers. The long term solution to Britain’s energy crisis include using less, says Jess Ralston, senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. With taxpayer support only set to last for six months under the current plan, the question is what happens after that? “Experts have said time and time again that the government’s approach to the gas crisis is missing a key component – conserving energy. While billions will be spent on bailing out bills, much less is targeted at the root of the problem, that we waste huge amounts of our energy.” The CBI, which represents UK businesses, is also concerned about what will happen when the package ends in six months time. Matthew Fell, CBI Chief Policy Director, says the cap on gas and electricity costs for non-domestic users announced today is ‘a substantial short-term fix to a long-term problem’. “The package will ease worries about otherwise viable businesses shutting-up shop and smaller companies especially will benefit from the discounted rate. “Businesses will also want to know more about the exit strategy and what happens when the six-month cap runs out. Working closely with business will be key to successful implementation. “The long-run solution is to double-down on energy security and to incentivise firms to push ahead with ambitious energy efficiency programmes to lower demand.” School leaders have welcomed the government’s new energy bill relief scheme, but warned that limiting it to six months would make it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially at a time when already tight budgets are under additional strain from unfunded pay awards to teachers and support staff. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said without the cap schools and colleges were facing “absolutely massive hikes” in energy costs which would have caused an immediate financial meltdown in the sector, our energy correspondent Sally Weale writes. But, Barton added, “The glaring problem is the fact that the scheme is time-limited to six months”, meaning schools cannot plan for the future with any confidence. “The government says it will review the operation of the scheme in three months’ time to inform decisions on future support after March 2023. However, this uncertainty makes it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence because they could be knocked off course at a later date by steep rises to energy bills if government support drops off. School and college budgets are incredibly tight and any financial ill-wind is potentially devastating. We will be pressing the government for a firmer commitment to the sector. Barton went on: “The other issue is the fact that pay awards for teachers and support staff have been agreed at a national level but there is no additional government funding for schools and colleges to be able to afford the cost of these awards. The pay awards are fully deserved and needed – and in fact do not go far enough – but the government’s expectation that this will be paid for out of existing budgets that are already very tight is completely unrealistic and unsustainable.” Although the government says today’s cap sets gas and electricity costs at just half the expected winter levels, the actual savings will depend when a firm signed its energy contract. BEIS have supplied an example of how the wholesale energy price cap will work for a pub which fixed its energy bill last month – when prices were surging. A pub uses 4 MWh of electricity and 16 MWh of gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in August 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £7,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWh for electricity, and £75/MWh for gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme. The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £380/MWh for electricity and £100/MWh for gas, meaning they receive a discount of £3,100 per month, reducing their bill by over 40%. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, has warned that the government must avoid a ‘cliff edge’ when today’s six-month package of help finishes at the end of March 2023. Nicholls says: “This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that Government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure. The Government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the Government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.” Many pubs had warned that they faced collapse this winter without support through the energy crisis: The Government plans to publish a review its Energy Bill Relief Scheme in three months time. That will examine whether it could be extended beyond the end of March 2023, and further targeted – or replaced with other targeted support for these most vulnerable users. A parallel support package for non-domestic users will be established in Northern Ireland, the BEIS department says (Northern Ireland has a different energy market than the rest of the UK, and isn’t covered by Ofgem’s domestic price cap). The government will also provide equivalent support to non-domestic users who use heating oil or alternative fuels instead of gas, because they aren’t connected to either the gas or electricity grid (with details to follow….). Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the government’s plans will “increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter”. Rees-Mogg explains: “We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes. “The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the Government’s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support. Worryingly, gas prices are rising this morning after Putin announced the partial mobilisation of Russian forces. The wholesale month-ahead UK gas price has risen 6% to 335p per therm – twice as much as a year ago (but only half its August peak). Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says the package will prevent companies collapsing under the weight of soaring energy bills this winter: “We have stepped in to stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs, and limit inflation. “And with our plans to boost home-grown energy supply, we will bring security to the sector, growth to the economy and secure a better deal for consumers.” Liz Truss says the new scheme will provide certainty and peace of mind to businesses, charities and public sector organisations this winter, by keeping their energy bills down. The new package is ‘equivalent’ to the support for households announced almost two weeks ago, says BEIS (although it won’t last as long). It will cap gas and electricity prices at ‘less than half’ the wholesale prices expected this winter, the department explains: To administer support, the Government has set a Supported Wholesale Price – expected to be £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas, less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter – which is a discounted price per unit of gas and electricity. This is equivalent to the wholesale element of the Energy Price Guarantee for households. It includes the removal of green levies paid by non-domestic customers who receive support under the scheme. Breaking: Gas and electricity costs for UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are to be capped – the government has announced. The BEIS department says that electricity prices are expected to be capped at £211 per megawatt hour, while gas prices will be capped at £75 per MWh –- in line with what was reported overnight. [that’s 21.1p/kWh for electricity and 7.5p/kWh for gas] Suppliers are to apply the reduction automatically to all eligible non-domestic customers, BEIS adds, with the government compensating suppliers for the cost. The savings will apply to contracts signed since April 1st this year – and run from 1st October to 31st March 2023. More details to follow…. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged the Chancellor not to pass the cost of an energy cap on to struggling families. Scotland’s Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans and Conor Murphy, Northern Ireland’s finance minister, have called for an extended and targeted support package for those worst hit by the cost-of-living crisis. In a joint letter to Kwasi Kwarteng, they say the UK government should impose a windfall tax to ensure the energy sector pays the price, “rather than passing on the cost through higher borrowing”. They say: “We are deeply concerned at who will bear the brunt of these costs. “Support should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing the cost to households through higher borrowing. “Looking ahead to your forthcoming fiscal statement, we urge you to focus efforts on those most impacted, not just relying on blanket interventions which do not recognise the scale of hardship particular households are facing. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg was spotted yesterday being filmed in Westminster – perhaps for an online video to outline today’s energy support package? Sam Coates of The Times has the details: The UK’s energy support packages for households and businesses are “something of almost a panic reaction.” That’s the verdict from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this morning. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think something like this was inevitable. Some businesses were seeing their energy bills going up by five times - or certainly that was likely to happen from October. “Just as households were going to need some protection, so were businesses. Johnson adds that the government is right to be planning more targeted support for businesses in six months time. “I rather wish they had done the same for households because for households and for businesses this is something of almost a panic reaction. “You have got to do something and the only thing that they can do immediately is protect everybody, whereas in the medium term if this goes on we really want something that is more targeted.” The prospect of a cut in UK stamp duty has pushed up shares in UK housebuilders. Persimmon (+4.6%), Barratt (+3.6%), Taylor Wimpey (+3.3%) and Berkeley (+3%) are all among the top FTSE 100 risers, as traders anticipate changes to the property sales tax. Weapons manufacturer BAE Systems has jumped almost 4.5%, as defence stocks rally after the ‘partial mobilisation’ announced by Putin this morning. Today’s public finances report shows the UK government received £7.8bn of revenue from stamp duty so far this financial year, over a third more than in April-August 2021. VAT revenues are up 12% this financial year (to £73.1bn), while PAYE income tax receipts are 10.7% higher (at £81.8bn). According to The Times, the government will announce plans to cut stamp duty in the its mini-budget this week in an attempt to drive economic growth. Liz Truss, they explain, believes that cutting stamp duty will encourage economic growth by allowing more people to move and enabling first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. But cutting stamp duty could simply allow sellers to charge more for their properties (as stamp duty is paid by the buyer), pushing up prices… Over in Germany, the government has agreed to nationalize gas importer Uniper in a historic move to prevent its energy sector collapsing. Under today’s deal, Germany will take control of Uniper, buying the 78% owned by Fortum -- which is majority owned by the Finnish government -- for about €480m. The government in Berlin will also inject €8bn into Uniper, after the Dusseldorf-based utility ran up billions of euros of losses after Russia cut off supplies to Europe. That sent Uniper scambling to find alternative gas supplies, as prices soared as European countries tried to built up storage before winter. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, dropping below last week’s weakest point. Sterling dropped below $1.131, levels last seen in 1985, before recovering a little. It’s now down over 16% against the dollar this year. The euro also weakened, while safe-haven government bonds are rallying, after Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilisation of forces in Russia, in a national address. Putin also accused the west of planning to destroy Russia and use nuclear blackmail, and said Russia would use “all means available to us”. Our liveblog on the Ukraine war has more details: Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government is right to help families and businesses, after the UK borrowed £11.8bn last month. Kwarteng said in a statement: “I have pledged to get debt down in the medium term. However, in the face of a major economic shock, it is absolutely right that the government takes action now to help families and businesses,” “Our priority is to grow the economy and improve living standards for everyone - with strong economic growth and sustainable public finances going hand in hand.” The UK borrowed nearly twice as much in August as the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted back in May, points out Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK: “Public sector borrowing came in at £11.8 billion in August, down by £2.6 billion from last year but £5.8 billion above the OBR’s forecast. This overshoot was driven by higher than expected inflation which pushed up debt interest costs, and the rollout of the first instalment of the £650 cost-of-living payment for households on means-tested benefits which began in July. A return of large-scale borrowing under Liz Truss’s government will be “a test for the bond markets”, Stelmach warns: “Since the start of the year, UK 10-year government bond yields have already risen by over 230 basis points. The expected increase in borrowing to fund the Energy Price Guarantee, coupled with a fall in the Bank of England’s gilt holdings, will be a test of whether private investors can absorb an outsized bond issuance without a further punitive increase in debt servicing costs.” Britain borrowed more than expected in August, as soaring inflation pushed up the UK deficit. Public sector borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, came in at £11.82bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports this morning. This was £2.6bn less than in August 2021 but £6.5bn more than in August 2019, before the pandemic, when the UK borrowed £5.3bn to balance the books. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted the UK would borrow £8.45bn. The deficit was pushed up by the cost of repaying existing debt. The UK spent £8.2bn on interest payments on central government debt in August. That includes £4.7bn due to the impact of rising RPI inflation (which pushed up the cost of repaying index-linked government debt). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are finally going to learn what support they will receive to help them through the energy crisis – but will it be enough? The government is expected to announce a cap on wholesale gas and electricity costs for these groups today, in the second part of its energy price guarantee to cut soaring bills. The plan, to be announced by business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to cut the rate for electricity and gas for non-domestic users by about 50% and 25% respectively, compared with current contracts. It’s likely to cost tens of billions of pounds, depending how high wholesale energy prices remain. Two weeks ago, Liz Truss promised ‘equivalent support’ for businesses and public sector organisations over the coming winter, when she announced the government would cap domestic bills at an average £2,500 a year But while those domestic cap runs for two years, the business support may only last six months for many firms. The discounts are set to apply to contracts signed since April 1 this year, and would last for six months starting from October 1, Bloomberg reported last night. That would help companies get through the winter crunch, but provide less certainty about the future. Yesterday, pub chain Fuller’s revealed its energy bill was due to more than double this year, from £8m to £18m, without government support. And business groups have warned that the UK faces a “lost generation” of traders, adding that a cap would not affect high standing charges imposed by suppliers. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Alex Lawson explain: Suppliers would be able to impose their own charges on top and would be compensated for the wholesale price cap by the government. This would be about 21p per kilowatt-hour for electricity and 7.5p per kWh for gas. There would be a different cap for those paying variable rates. Government sources said this was the most likely model and scale of energy bill support for businesses, without saying how much the total package would cost the Treasury. Craig Beaumont, the chief of external affairs at the FSB, said: “If the government is going for a fixed wholesale price, tomorrow we need to understand how that will be applied to small businesses’ energy bills in practice. A small business will need to be told by their supplier, fast, what their new bill will be. “However, there may be no regulation of the other major element of small business energy bills – the standing charge. “While consumers will have their standing charge capped, small firms won’t, and that means energy providers could continue to hike standing charges, and so still mean small businesses seeing their energy bills spiral.” We’ll also be watching the financial markets today, where investors are bracing for another hefty rise in US interest rates tonight. Economists are predicting the US Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months.

The US has long maintained influence and a military presence in the Pacific region. Over the last decade, China has focused on strengthening its ties in Pacific through increased aid, development, diplomacy and security cooperation. In 2022, Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China, sparking international concern over the possibility of Beijing building its first military base in the region. At the same time, the US ramped up its Pacific diplomacy, hosting a landmark Pacific leaders summit and whirlwind tours by senior officials, including vice-president Kamala Harris, and pledged more aid. In February the US reopened an embassy in Solomons Islands after a 30 year absence. Australia, which had been accused of neglecting its own relationship with Pacific countries, has also conducted a diplomatic push amid fears of Chinese influence growing in the region. Australia has also overtaken China as the “leading source of bilateral loans to the Pacific,” according to 2022 data from the Lowy Institute. The amount of development finance China has provided to the region has been falling since 2016, according to the data, which the institute said “does not contradict recent perceptions that China has sought to ‘increase its engagement’ with Pacific Island countries.” Instead, China appears to be focusing on strengthening security cooperation, as with the Solomon Islands deal, and increasing commercial activities. Re-engagement by the US has continued, with encouragement from Pacific leaders. In early 2023, the presidents of Kiribati, Palau, Nauru, the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia said they expect US president Joe Biden would visit the Pacific in the “near future”, though the trip has not been confirmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/feb/24/los-angeles-2028-olympics-karen-bass-ioc","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-24T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Los Angeles has already ceded too much power to the Olympic machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/24/los-angeles-2028-olympics-karen-bass-ioc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/feb/24/los-angeles-2028-olympics-karen-bass-ioc","fields":{"bodyText":"When the International Olympic Committee handed the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles back in 2017, the Games floated fuzzily in a futuristic fairyland. Eric Garcetti, then mayor of LA, promised everything but free kittens and unicorns, vowing the Olympics “will lift up every community in Los Angeles”. Today, five years before the Games, the freshly elected mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, is sliding into the same well-worn grooves of Olympic myth-making. Now is the time for Bass and her administration to sharpen their focus, get up to speed on hard Olympic realities, and start asking tough questions of the IOC. It’s not too late. Bass arrives with progressive bona fides. Her election is meant to herald a more just city government that is less hostile to workers and the poor, particularly the legions of those who are unhoused. Yet when it comes to the 2028 Olympics, Bass has been more of the same, essentially cloning the missteps of her predecessor. She made this clear when she selected Christopher Thompson to be her chief of staff. Before being tapped, Thompson was the head of government relations for the LA28 Olympic organizing committee. Now this “head of government relations” is part of – and indistinguishable from – the government itself. The merging of corporate, Olympic and public power has caused enough consternation that questions immediately surfaced over what role Thompson will play in regards to Olympic organization and city contracts. The Bass administration issued a clipped response, asserting that Thompson “will not participate in matters regarding the Olympics for the first year of his service”. In truth, Bass had no choice. She was merely adhering to conflict of interest rules in the Ethics Handbook for City Officials. In an age of rampant corruption in LA city government, ethical guidelines may be refreshing, but how does starting his intervention into the city’s Olympic planning in 2024 any different than starting in 2023? Not only is it somewhat arbitrary, but it also beggars belief that the chief of staff for the mayor won’t have a say in what will be the largest expenditure of City Hall resources in years. In addition, Thompson comes to this job with zero LA city hall experience. His Olympic connections are a main selling point for the job. Even more worrying are the mayor’s public statements on Olympic financing. At one mayoral debate, Bass was asked whether she could assure taxpaying Angelenos that they would not be a backstop for Olympic cost overruns. She stated unequivocally, “Absolutely I would promise taxpayers that.” Thing is, the city and state have already agreed to cover cost overruns to the tune of $270m each. And let’s be clear: academic research finds that every single Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget. In fact, the cost of the 2028 Games has already leapfrogged from an estimated $5.3bn during the bid phase to $6.9bn only two years later. And that tally doesn’t include billions in security costs. In 2020, Donald Trump sat shoulder to shoulder with LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman and pledged that the security tab would largely be covered by the federal government – in other words, US taxpayers. Angelenos may consider Paris where organizers are ramping up preparations for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Back in 2017, the International Olympic Committee made a hail-mary move, simultaneously allocating the 2024 Games to Paris and 2028 to LA. Bidders in both Paris and LA vowed their Games would sidestep the entrenched downsides of the Games such as overspending, intensified policing, and gentrification. And yet, today in Paris, Olympic costs are escalating, public transport costs are skyrocketing, and the French parliament is on the verge of passing an invasive surveillance law. So much for doing things differently. Bass would also do well to reach out to Zev Yaroslavsky, the former LA council member who oversaw the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. In 2021, appearing on LA radio station KCRW, Yaroslavsky said of the host city contract that Los Angeles signed with the International Olympic Committee: “No private sector individual would ever have signed such a contract. And, in fact, when that contract was brought to the city, I took it … to three of the most able and competent lawyers in Los Angeles in this field and I asked them: ‘What do you think?’ And they said, ‘I would never allow my client to sign such a contract.’” He also noted, “You don’t sign a blank check to the International Olympic Committee if you are a steward of the taxpayers’ money. You just can’t do that.” Yaroslavsky is right. The IOC is not to be trusted. It is a cartel that disregards the well-founded concerns of everyday people in the host city while prioritizing its own profits. The Olympics tend to induce magical thinking in host-city public officials, and not in a good way. During one of the mayoral debates, Bass essentially pledged to eliminate homelessness by the time the LA Games rolled around, stating, “I do believe that when the Olympics comes in 2028 and I’m mayor, there won’t be encampments.” This parrots the line Garcetti took on late night television: “I’m confident that by the time the Olympics come, we can end homelessness on the streets of LA,” he said. Bass’s comments elicited guffaws from debate attendees, but there’s nothing funny about the humanitarian crisis in plain sight known as homelessness. Declaring a homelessness state of emergency was a positive first step, but hosting the Olympics will only divert precious City Hall resources away from this crucial task and into planning for an optional sports spectacle. Bass has her work cut out for her. The Olympics are already quietly affecting LA in other ways, whether it be the timetable for the gondola project in Chinatown, or the retirement plans of the city’s police chief, Michel Moore. In city after city, the Olympics rejigger urban space to the benefit of the well-connected at the expense of everyone else, and LA is no exception. At the recent unveiling of former Garcetti’s official portrait, the “LA28” logo was clearly visible in the top left corner. But Garcetti no longer runs the show. Any fallout from the LA 2028 Olympics will fall squarely on Bass’s shoulders. Under Garcetti, the Olympics brazenly short-circuited democracy. The city has already ceded too much power to the Olympic machine. Time for Mayor Bass to start yanking it back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/us-urged-to-hold-assad-to-account-as-power-shifts-in-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T18:01:17Z","webTitle":"US urged to hold Assad to account as power shifts in Middle East","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/us-urged-to-hold-assad-to-account-as-power-shifts-in-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/us-urged-to-hold-assad-to-account-as-power-shifts-in-middle-east","fields":{"bodyText":"Moves to re-engage Bashar al-Assad without him taking steps to stabilise Syria or commit to reforms should be met by more robust US leadership that holds the Syrian leader to account and addresses a litany of US policy failings, a group of prominent former officials say. In an unprecedented letter to Joe Biden and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the officials called for moves to stop a regional drift towards normalisation with Assad and impose a formalised ceasefire that facilitates a more impactful aid effort and helps ignite a political process. The appeal follows moves by the UAE to normalise relations with Assad, which are likely to be followed by other Arab states. Saudi Arabia on Friday flagged that it may follow suit, after a highly public state visit by the Syrian leader to Abu Dhabi earlier this month in which a 21-gun salute and a motorcade appeared to herald his official reappearance on an Arab stage, after being treated as an outcast for nearly 12 years. Signatories to the letter include a former CIA director, John McLaughlin, the most senior US official to work on Syria since 2011; James Jeffrey, a former US special envoy for Syria; retired Mne Corp General Anthony Zinni; and Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force – as well as civil society activists at the forefront of efforts to highlight crimes against humanity committed by the Assad regime. The regional moves to re-engage Assad have sparked alarm in parts of the Biden administration and in Europe, where steps are under way to prosecute low-level regime officials for war crimes. Investigators have been gathering material that could place more senior officials in the crosshairs of international prosecutors. Of particular concern is how to stabilise areas that remain outside the control of the central government, which are heavily dependent on aid, susceptible to local power bases and at the whim of neighbouring states. Assad has been unwilling to meaningfully reconcile with such areas, primarily in northern Syria. “None of the issues that caused the Syria conflict have been resolved, most notably Assad regime atrocities and inability or refusal to reform,” the letter says. “Many of the conflict’s symptoms are worsening, from human suffering, industrial-scale drug trafficking, refugee flows, terrorism, geopolitical conflict and ethnic and sectarian hostilities. “The Biden administration’s foreign policy priorities of great power competition, international and Middle East stability, human rights, humanitarianism, or combating food insecurity are insufficiently advanced through the current Syria policy. “Piecemeal normalisation efforts by some regional governments do not address US national security interests or human rights issues, and they erode the international community’s capacity to shape a political process aimed at meaningfully resolving the crisis.” The letter calls for a ceasefire to be formalised as a first step, and guaranteed by “external stakeholders”. Such a move would almost certainly require the input of a US administration that has disengaged from the Middle East and is focusing much of its foreign policy energies on Ukraine. Charles Lister, director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at the Middle East Institute, said: “For regional states re-engaging Assad’s regime, the calculus is driven by a simple fact: the US and allies are nowhere to be seen. Their Syria policy is impotent and indifferent, and with that, the regime is not only going nowhere, it’s being granted an unchallenged victory. “If we create a vacuum, someone’s going to step into it; if we show no serious interest in pushing determinedly for justice and accountability, why should regional states?” Meanwhile, regional moves to engage Assad are accelerating. “The logic behind it all has to do with the new realisation that the Syrian regime is here to stay,” said Prof Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent UAE scholar. “The UAE tried everything possible, militarily, diplomatically, economically, over the past 10 years to help the Syrians topple this regime. “Reality on the ground says we need to engage him. Short of dismantling him, real politics requires that you talk and re-engage. This is a fundamental departure from the past. We all know that he is not a good person, that he has killed many of his people, that he has committed war crimes and did so many outrageous things and probably still does. But morality is something and politics is something else.” He added: “This is also part of the policy of reaching out to adversaries over the last 10 years. Turkey, Iran, Qatar, Israel and Syria fall into that. They are asking him to be receptive to a few more possible outcomes. Caring for the nearly 12 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, for example. More Arab presence probably will transfer in to less Iranian presence. Not total Syrian disengagement to Iran, that’s not feasible. But more Arab presence in Damascus will likely translate into less Iranian presence. “I know we differ with our American and European friends on this. We have our own way of thinking. This is an Arab case. But I think they will eventually realise the realities on the ground. Bulldozers sometimes take the brunt and the criticism, but that’s the role the UAE is playing these days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T18:35:12Z","webTitle":"Nuclear fusion ‘holy grail’ is not the answer to our energy prayers | Letters ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","fields":{"bodyText":"You report on the alleged “breakthrough” on nuclear fusion, in which US researchers claim that break-even has been achieved (Breakthrough in nuclear fusion could mean ‘near-limitless energy’, 12 December).

Laser fusion, particularly as a component of a fission-fusion hybrid reactor, can produce neutrons that can be used to produce the nuclear explosives plutonium-239, uranium-235 and uranium-233. It could also produce tritium, a form of heavy hydrogen, which is used to boost the explosive power of a fission explosion, making fission bombs smaller and hence more suitable for use in missile warheads. This information is available in open research literature. The US National Ignition Facility, which did the research, is part of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has a history of involvement with nuclear weaponry. Dr Mark Diesendorf University of New South Wales • As someone who once wrote a critical report for the European parliament on fusion power back in the late 1980s, I hate to rain on Arthur Turrell’s splendid parade (The carbon-free energy of the future: this fusion breakthrough changes everything, 13 December). It is indeed good news that the US National Ignition Facility has got a “net energy gain” of 1.1 MJ from an inertial confinement fusion device using lasers. In this regard, what is really valuable is that the community can now concentrate on this type of reactor, rather than other designs like the tokamak. However, I am prepared to bet that a true fusion power station is unlikely to be running before my grandchildren turn 70. After all, it has taken 60-odd years and huge amounts of money to get this far. Dr Chris Cragg London • Arthur Turrell writes that achieving “net energy gain” has a psychological effect akin to a trumpet to the ear. Well, it might do to him but not to me. Yes, it’s a fantastic achievement for those scientists and engineers who have worked to achieve this proof on concept; well done them. But it will make not one jot of a positive difference to the challenges my children and grandchildren will face as a result of the climate crisis. We only have years to achieve the changes that are necessary to avoid social catastrophe due to what’s happening to the biosphere, and that’s assuming it’s not already too late. Even the optimists understand that it will be decades before fusion power can contribute to the grid, regardless of this achievement. Meanwhile the headlines that followed this result, Turrell’s psychological trumpet, simply serve to reassure and detract from the urgency of what needs to be done now. Dick Willis Bristol • It is great news that scientists have succeeded in getting more energy out of fusion than they put in. It brings to mind a quote from a past director of the Central Electricity Generating Board: “One day you may get more energy out of nuclear fusion than you put in, but you will never get more money out than you put in.” Martin O’Donovan Ashtead, Surrey • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Drax, the power generator that owns the eponymous plant in North Yorkshire, posted underlying profits of £731m for 2022, up from £398m a year earlier. The company also increased its dividend by 11.7% to 21p a share – an £84m payout to shareholders. Drax, which has faced criticism over its use of biomass, has benefited from soaring power prices over the past year. Electricity prices are linked to wholesale gas costs, which have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Will Gardiner, the chief executive, said: “Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.” Drax, which supplies up to 6% of the UK’s electricity, and is seen as a source of when weather conditions preclude significant wind and solar power generation. Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing, arguing its biomass operations, which burn wood pellets to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Most of the wood is imported from North America. The former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called its business model “not sustainable”. Drax was the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation over alleged forest destruction and has also been accused of “environmental racism”. The power company said it had earned £837m in subsidies in 2020 and £885m in 2021. The level of support fell to £617m in 2022 as electricity prices exceed an agreed “strike price” agreed to encourage renewable investment. This meant Drax paid out £33m to the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a government-owned firm, compared with receiving £231m under the same mechanism a year earlier. However, it still received £650m under an older renewable energy scheme. The thinktank Ember has estimated that, from 2012 until 2027, when the support runs out, Drax would have collected more than £11bn in subsidies. The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government pays significant sums in renewable energy subsidies to bioenergy companies making sizeable profits, despite it releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and harming forests’ ability to absorb carbon. “This directly costs bill payers and families through their energy bills. In the context of the cost of living crisis, the government should be looking into these subsidies and ensuring they are used for proven renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, rather than harming nature.” Sally-Ann Hart, a Conservative MP, said: “Burning imported wood pellets for electricity is not cheap for bill payers. Given the growing environmental concerns, ministers shouldn’t commit to new subsidies for this energy source. “We should prioritise investment in clean and cheap energy sources that keep the lights on and bills low while tackling climate change, not an industry which risks fuelling deforestation.” Research by the Cut Carbon Not Forests coalition found that 62% of 2,005 UK adults surveyed thought it was wrong for the government to hand the bioenergy generator large subsidies, particularly during a cost of living crisis. The SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: “It’s clear that the British public aren’t falling for the myth that biomass is carbon neutral, no matter how many greenwashing PR stunts companies like Drax pull to convince people otherwise.” Drax is the latest UK energy firm to report a sharp rise in profits, after BP, Shell and the British Gas owner, Centrica. Their gains led to renewed calls for tougher windfall taxes. Some of Drax’s operations are covered by the electricity generator levy introduced this year but the company said recognition in the construction of the tax that biomass costs were higher than those of windfarms meant the levy “should not have an adverse impact on biomass generation”. Separately, more than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, have begun a series of strikes that will run through February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal. The company also agreed to extend the life of two coal units through the winter after a government request, amid fears over power cuts. The units have not been called into action but Drax said on Thursday that they “delivered income during the final quarter of 2022”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T10:40:13Z","webTitle":"UK’s nuclear waste cleanup operation could cost £260bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","fields":{"bodyText":"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s 20th-century nuclear waste could rise to £260bn as the aged and degrading sites present growing challenges, according to analysis presented to an international group of experts. As the government pursues nuclear energy with the promise of a new generation of reactors, the cost of safely cleaning up waste from previous generations of power stations is soaring. Degrading nuclear facilities are presenting increasingly hazardous and challenging problems. Ageing equipment and electrical systems at Sellafield, which is storing much of the country’s nuclear waste and is one of the most hazardous sites in the world, are increasing the risk of fire, according to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. They require increasing maintenance and present growing risk. Last October a faulty light fitting started a blaze at a Sellafield facility which led to its closure for several weeks. Analysis by Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, estimates the total bill for decommissioning the UK’s nuclear waste mountain will grow to £260bn. Thomas told a conference of international experts the cost of decommissioning Sellafield had risen from to £110bn, according to freedom of information requests. Other sites that need decommissioning are the 11 Magnox power stations, built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built from the 1960s to the 1980s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Deterioration of one of the Magnox stations, Trawsfynydd, which shut down in 1991, is such that substantial work is needed to make it safe, according to the NDA. “Work that would then need to be undone to complete reactor dismantling,” the agency said. Thomas told the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group similar problems are expected at other Magnox sites. The timetable for decommissioning the old nuclear power stations has been abandoned, with no new timescale yet published. The Nuclear Waste Service has said deferring decommissioning for 85 years from shutdown, which was previous policy, is not suitable for all the reactors because of their different ages and physical conditions. Decommissioning of some Magnox stations will have to be brought forward, the NWS has said. Attempts to speed up the decommissioning would only add to the growing bill, Thomas said, which he estimated had increased to £34bn. In 2005, the cost for decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 70s and 90s was put at £51bn. Last year the NDA estimates rose to £131bn, and its latest annual report said £149bn was needed to pay for the clear up. But Thomas said rising costs meant the total bill was on track to reach £260bn. Part of the soaring increase is the cost of building a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 double decker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme. The mammoth engineering project was initially predicted to cost £11bn but the bill is now estimated to be up to £53bn because of uncertainty about where the site will be located, and the need to provide space for an unspecified amount of waste from the new generation of nuclear reactors which the government wants to build. Four areas of the country are being considered for the GDF but no decision on where it will be located has yet been made. “While we are clear about the current legacy of waste which already exists, a GDF would have to handle additional waste from new facilities being developed,” the NWService said. “The actual cost will … depend on the number of new nuclear projects that the UK develops in future and any additional waste from those stations.” The cleanup of past nuclear waste will take more than 100 years, the NDA has said. Highlighting the challenges of the degrading and hazardous facilities, the authority said in its annual report that robots and drones were increasingly being used to carry out site inspections. • This article was amended on 28 September 2022.

It fired 25 missiles of various kinds on Wednesday – including one that landed close to South Korea’s waters, in what President Yoon Suk-yeol said was effectively “a territorial invasion by a missile”. It was the first time since the 1945 division of the peninsula that North Korea weapons had landed so close to South Korea, 26km beyond the northern limit line. With the New York Times reporting that US intelligence had picked up Russian military chatter about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the talks to prevent Iran building a nuclear bomb at a total impasse, a third nuclear front just adds to the sense of a world on the brink. The possibility, now confirmed by Washington, that North Korea is also providing missiles to the depleted Russian forces in Ukraine only adds to the sense it will be hard to continue to park North Korea in the overflowing pending tray. North Korea insists there is a rational logic to its actions, saying it was responding to Washington and Seoul mounting Vigilant Storm, the largest joint military drills in its history. These exercises, designed to deter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, involve 240 warplanes – including advanced F-35 stealth fighters – conducting about 1,600 sorties. The large-scale drills began on Monday and will run until Friday. It now seems likely that North Korea will test a nuclear bomb for the first time since 2017, prompting some to argue that it is time for the US to recognise that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state. North Korea lives in fear of an invasion, and it is not as if Kim Jong-un has hidden how he plans to prevent one. Last year he set out a five-year plan, explaining all new weapons that North Korea planned to develop. This included smaller battlefield nuclear bombs and the short-range missiles to carry them. The recent round of tests and drills shows he is earnest in his intent, and there is nothing internal or external that is going to make him change his plans. Analysts of North Korea, one of the most opaque countries in the authoritarian world, often disagree whether the leadership’s nuclear ambitions are driven by internal or external factors. One argument is that Kim’s ultimate goal is to create a crisis he can offer to defuse in return for concessions on sanctions or trade deals. The other school says this underplays the extent to which North Korea’s leaders are driven by fear of domestic economic failure. The Peterson Institute of International Economics on 28 September reported that North Korea was locked in the worst crisis of food insecurity since the great famines of the mid-1990s and concluded that in the most recent harvest cycle, a mixture of inadequate water and Covid restrictions meant North Korea had “probably fallen below the level of minimum human needs”, partly due to rises in the price of grain. Whatever the motive, it leaves Yoon’s “audacious plan” unveiled on 15 August, setting out the benefits North Korea would receive in return for a denuclearisation programme, looks even more of a dead letter. There had been high hopes for the plan: to distinguish it from previous incarnations, the Yoon government had indicated that South Korea could offer food aid in the early stage if North Korea returned to the denuclearisation talks even before it took concrete steps. The immediate US backing for South Korea’s plan added another incentive, raising the hope that some kind of partial sanction relief could be possible for North Korea. But the plan was rejected by Pyongyang on the grounds that it was largely a recycling of previous offers that would have denuded the country of its security. No-one would trade away their destiny for corn cake, Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, decreed. So Washington is waiting to see if North Korea will revive its nuclear test programme, and has only limited options if it does. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said last week: “Everybody is holding its breath about this, because another nuclear test would be yet another confirmation of a programme which is moving full steam ahead, in a way that is incredibly, incredibly concerning, Further tests, of course, means that they are refining the preparations and the construction of their arsenal.” So the world now faces the prospect of one rogue state in Asia, and another theocratic state in the Middle East coming closer to possessing a nuclear bomb than ever before, and at the same time a cornered nuclear superpower actually threatening to puts its arsenal to use. It is not the best backdrop for Joe Biden’s run-in to the midterm elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-11T19:00:03Z","webTitle":"Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","fields":{"bodyText":"In my mid-20s, I undertook the quintessentially Australian rite of passage of moving to London for a few years. Months into my first English winter, I started having dreams about the Australian wilderness. The images were so vivid and specific that I jotted them down. I had a recurring dream about looking at the sea from a high vantage point, somewhere along the south-east Queensland coast that I had always taken for granted. There was “all manner of ocean life”, I noted: dolphins jumping in the shallows; two whales, a mother and calf, out in deeper water. “Got really excited about seeing my first wild platypus,” I wrote about another dream, still never having spotted one in real life. I had never considered myself a particularly outdoorsy person, but London’s occasional urban grimness had triggered a nostalgia for the natural environment of my childhood. When I returned home, it was with a newfound appreciation for the soft evening chirp of cicadas, the fine sand that sticks to everything and the mist of humpbacks on the horizon. As the pandemic has highlighted, I am not alone in desiring more time in nature when access to it is limited. The restorative effects of spending time in green spaces, it turns out, may be essential for our health and wellbeing. “Research shows that over time we’ve become more disconnected as humans from nature,” Prof Thomas Astell-Burt, a population health expert at the University of Wollongong, tells me. A 2017 study, for example, found that pop culture references to nature – in fiction, song lyrics and film storylines – have declined since the 1950s. “It might reflect that we as a society have become much more inward focused on our urban consumerist lifestyles,” Astell-Burt says. As early as the 1990s, researchers found that going for a walk in a natural environment as opposed to an urban landscape brought about improvements in people’s ability to concentrate, feelings of wellbeing and even in blood pressure, he says. Being in nature, studies tell us, has significant positive effects on our mental and physical health. Living close to green or blue spaces – rural or coastal environments – has been linked time and time again to reductions in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Access to green space has also been linked to a reduced risk of loneliness and some have even suggested that interacting with microbes in the environment may be beneficial for our immune systems. Overseas, the link between spending time in nature and wellbeing has led to the rise of nature-based prescription programs, sometimes described as “green prescriptions” or “blue prescriptions”. In 2020, the UK government announced £4m for a two-year green prescription pilot in four areas that had been hard hit by Covid. Since the beginning of 2022, doctors in several Canadian provinces have been able to prescribe time in nature to their patients, including a pass that gives access to the country’s national parks. In Japan, health practitioners have recommended shinrin-yoku – forest bathing, a practice that involves connecting with nature through the senses – since 1982. In Australia, nature prescribing is not yet commonplace, despite a growing body of research pointing to both potential benefits and local interest. Studies of nearly 47,000 Australians have found that in urban areas, a threshold of at least 30% green space or tree canopy is associated with health benefits, including lower odds of diabetes and psychological distress. “We really have enough local evidence to show that’s how much we need for Australia,” says Prof Xiaoqi Feng from the University of New South Wales school of population health. “In all our research papers we control for competing socioeconomic explanations like income and education and still find evidence that green space benefits mental and physical health.” In 2021, an eight-week nature prescription trial run by Green Adelaide found that participants who completed the program reported improved general wellbeing and connectedness to nature. The trial, however, only included six participants. A national survey Astell-Burt and Feng conducted during the pandemic found that 82% of Australian adults would be interested in receiving a nature prescription and that appetite was still high (76%) among those who were spending the least amount of time – less than two hours a week – in nature. “There is no national or even state nature prescription program to which health professionals could refer these individuals or any sort of consistent guidelines that health professionals could follow in Australia,” Astell-Burt says. “We need to run high-quality randomised trials which show definitively what types of nature prescriptions work where, when and for whom. We can’t assume there’ll be a one-size-fits-all solution.” Though research into the positive effects of blue spaces – time near oceans, lakes or rivers – is still emerging, Astell-Burt suggests their benefits would be broadly comparable. Dr Rowena Ivers, a general practitioner in Wollongong, has been recommending time in nature to some of her patients. “Most of it now is having a conversation with people. With people with chronic disease, we might write it into a chronic disease care plan.” Some of the recommendations might be paired with exercise, such as bushwalking or participating in parkruns, or with civic engagement, such as working in a community garden or on bush regeneration projects. “There’s a whole range of ways that it can be done depending on what the person enjoys,” Ivers says. “GPs have a growing awareness of social prescribing … but we know that beyond that, activities that are in nature have extra benefits.” Experts suggest that spending time in nature may not have the same barrier to uptake as exercise, which people might dread or avoid despite knowledge of its benefits. The upside of a nature prescription is not having to work up the motivation to, say, tackle a big run in the park, Feng says. “You could just relax there, listen to birdsong, be with your friends [or] even just have a small urban garden on your balcony.” While “it’s not a silver bullet”, Feng suggests that nature prescriptions could be integrated into the health system as part of routine care. “[It] could have multiple benefits for people’s mental, social and physical health and probably cost little to the individual and the health system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T14:09:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the partially occupied region of Zaporizhzhia, where he meet with UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency said they had “a rich exchange on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant”. In a message on Telegram, Ukraine’s president said “I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said. Zelenskiy posted to his official Telegram that“Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reported, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. Zelenskiy on Sunday urged all Ukrainians to remain engaged with developments in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. “Now, just as it was a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, real hostilities are taking place geographically far from many,” said the Ukrainian president in his nightly address. Heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said Sunday in a televised interview broadcast.

While that’s the headline, the count is not yet done. Here’s a summary of what we know just before midnight: Labor are on track to form a majority government, with results in a few key seats still unclear late on Saturday as counting ended for the night. Various vote counts have Labor hovering at the 47 seats needed for majority government. Dominic Perrottet will stand down as New South Wales Liberal leader, he announced in a concession speech in which he said he feels a “profound sense of gratitude” to have led the state. Former treasurer Matt Kean, when asked if he was interested in the leadership, said it was too early to say. Both Perrottet and Minns heaped praise on each other for waging a fair campaign. The Coalition have lost a slew of seats, including many once considered safe Liberal seats. Wakehurst, held by retiring health minister Brad Hazzard, has been won by independent Michael Regan. Liberal MP Stuart Ayres appears to have lost his seat of Penrith to Labor, as many other Liberal-held western Sydney seats fell to Labor. The outcome in several key seats is still unclear. Willoughby is on a knife-edge, with independent challenger Larissa Penn ever so slightly leading Liberal MP Tim James. Independent challenger in Wollondilly Judy Hannan is also the (slight) favourite over Liberal MP Nathaniel Smith. With that, we’ll wrap up our live election blog for the night. You can read more of our coverage from today here. Premier-elect Chris Minns’ victory speech: ‘Back and ready’: Chris Minns leads Labor to power after 12 years in opposition at historic 2023 NSW election Labor is on track to form majority government in New South Wales after 12 years in opposition, with the party leader, 43-year-old former firefighter and political staffer Chris Minns, declaring the party is “back and ready to govern in this great state”. As counting ended on Saturday night, Labor had picked up at least nine seats, enough to govern in majority and a better-than-expected result for the party after big swings in many previously safe Coalition seats. The result means Minns will become the first Labor leader to win government from opposition in NSW for almost three decades and sees the Coalition relegated to the opposition benches in every parliament on mainland Australia. Read more from Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose: Northern beaches seat of Wakehurst falls to independent, but Liberals hold on in Manly and Lane Cove The independent mayor of Northern Beaches council, Michael Regan, has romped to victory in the New South Wales state seat of Wakehurst, snatching the previously blue-ribbon Liberal seat held by the retiring health minister, Brad Hazzard, with a 27.5% swing. Regan won with a decisive 56% of the two-party preferred vote, ending decades of Liberal dominance in the region. The win means that independents now represent the northern beaches at federal, state and local level. The strong showing by independents on the northern beaches will raise questions for the Liberal party, which selected candidates late and chose men who had worked for the party. Read more on how independents fared this election: Victoria’s premier Daniel Andrews has congratulated Chris Minns on his victory. Labor’s victory in NSW means there is a Labor government in power across every mainland state and territory. (Tasmania’s government is Liberal) If he forms a majority, Minns will be just the third to achieve it from opposition since Bill McKell in 1941. Neville Wran and Bob Carr are the only others to have done it, in 1976 and 1995 respectively. Less certainty around close seats A number of seats that various TV networks were eager to call early now appear far less certain, as the count broadly progresses to 50%-60% of the vote. The ABC is now projecting Labor to win Holsworthy by just 0.6%. Labor is now projected to win Kiama by 1.8% – held by ex-Liberal turned independent Gareth Ward. In Wollondilly, the ABC is projecting independent Judy Hannan will win by a margin of 0.7%. Independent Larissa Penn’s projected lead in Willoughby has also shrunk. The ABC are projecting her as 0.2% ahead of Liberal Tim James. Watch Dominic Perrottet’s concession speech here: Minns says Labor win ‘a vote against privatisation’ Premier elect Chris Minns has said Labor’s victory in the New South Wales election was at least in part fought over privatisation. It’s undeniably the case that today’s election was also a decisive vote against privatisation. To retain Sydney Water and Essential Energy in New South Wales Government. In the final weeks of the campaign, Labor ramped up its messaging about the Coalition’s history of and plans for privatisation of state assets. Minns also thanks various Labor party figures and advisers, as well as the union movement – which drew a noticeable round of applause from the crowd of supporters. Minns ends by thanking his family. After 12 years in opposition, I want to say to the people who voted for Labor or voted for the Liberals and Nationals or voted for independents or minor party candidates today. We’ve been elected by the people of this state but we will govern for everyone in NSW. We know that the challenges are huge. We know the responsibilities are awesome, but NSW Labor is back and ready to govern in this great state. Thank you. “Friends after 12 years in opposition the people of New South Wales have voted for a fresh start,” he says, thanking the Labor party faithful in the crowd. Minns thanks volunteers who helped his campaign to retain his own seat of Kogarah, which was a concern going into the election. I thought it was going to be close but in the end we got there. Minns then thanks outgoing premier, Dominic Perrottet, for his service to NSW. I would like to say thank you to the premier for his service on behalf of the people of NSW. He echoes Perrottet’s reflection of the NSW campaign. It’s undeniably the case that this election campaign perhaps uniquely was a model of respect and civility and neither party took the low road. Neither political party took the low blow. And I think it can be a model for the way democracy is done right across this country. Now, I can’t say that every election campaign in the future will be conducted the same way. But from now on, no one will be able to say that it can’t be. Minns walks to stage amid cheers of ‘Labor! Labor!’ Premier-elect Chris Minns, walking with his wife and three sons, is making his way through a crowd of elated supporters at Labor’s election night function, as he takes to the stage to claim victory in the New South Wales election. Those in the crowd are chanting “Labor, Labor”. As he walks onto the stage, Anthony Albanese takes Minns’ hand and lifts it in the air. PM warms up the Labor crowd for premier-elect Anthony Albanese has taken the stage at Labor’s election night function to welcome on Chris Minns. The crowd applauded the prime minister as he walked onto the stage, but he said “tonight is someone else’s night”. “Friends tonight the people of New South Wales have come together to choose a better future.” “I have had the very good fortune of knowing Chris for many, many years And what I know, without doubt, is that he embodies all that is best about the Australian Labor party.” Just unpacking a bit more of Dominic Perrottet’s speech: He said Liberal MP Stuart Ayres “can hold his head very high”, as the Penrith MP stares down a loss to Labor. The ABC is projecting he will lose the seat, but when speaking to Sky News earlier, Ayres was yet to concede. During Perrottet’s concession speech a few minutes ago, the outgoing premier said: It doesn’t appear that Stuart (Ayres) will have the result that he wanted, or that I wanted this evening in Penrith. But Stuart can hold his head very high. He’s served his community of Penrith incredibly well and he served our state with distinction. Immediately after Dominic Perrottet finishes speaking, the ABC panel asks Matt Kean if he will run for Liberal leadership. Kean again says it is too early to say. Dominic Perrottet has announced he will step down as Liberal leader, claiming the party needs a “fresh start”. As Perrottet announced this during his concession speech, the crowd at Liberal gathering jeered. “To everyone in the Liberal party, I’d say this next period of time will not be easy, but it will be necessary. It is a time to reflect. It is a time to rethink and ultimately to renew. To renew as leader of the parliamentary Liberal party, I take full responsibility for the loss this evening. And as a result, I will be standing down as the parliamentary leader (jeers) of the Liberal party. It’s very clear we need a fresh start for the Liberal party.” Dominic Perrottet feels a “profound sense of gratitude” to have led New South Wales Now friends, it goes without saying. I think we all wanted to have a different result this evening. But we as a party, we as a government should be very proud of what we have achieved together. I feel a profound sense of gratitude to have been able to serve the people of New South Wales. Make no mistake, we’ve made history of being in government for the longest time since our party was formed. And our government has achieved so much in so many ways. We’ve kept NSW strong, free and fair. Perrottet said NSW is a “much better place today than it was 12 years ago” and that the Coalition’s legacy will be one “of infrastructure, of investment and of imagination”. He names the metro projects in Sydney, as well as more controversial motorways, museums and stadiums, as important elements of the Coalition’s legacy in government. Outgoing premier asks for support for incoming opponent Outgoing premier Dominic Perrottet has asked New South Wales residents, regardless of political leaning, to “get behind” Chris Minns as premier. I truly believe and have no doubt that he will make a fine 47th premier of New South Wales because I believe that he will lead with the same decency and the same integrity that he has led with so far. Ultimately I ask everybody across NSW, whatever your political persuasion, to get behind him, to get behind him, because where NSW goes well, our country goes well, and that is something that is something tonight, I believe, we can all unite behind. The Liberal leader has arrived at the Liberal’s election night function and is delivering his concession piece. “A short while ago, I called Chris Minns to congratulate him and the Labor party on their election victory,” he said to a mixed reception form the Liberal faithful. “The great people of New South Wales tonight have decided to elect a Labor government in the state. And that is a decision that we respect. I particularly tonight want to acknowledge the leader of the opposition. Elections can get ugly, but I believe this election truly was a race to the top. “A genuine battle of ideas. And that’s when politics is at its best.” The former PM is now at the Liberal’s election night party in Sydney’s CBD – where the mood is grim. Howard arrived at the Liberal event at 9.40pm and walked into the ballroom with his wife Janette and Liberal minister Alister Henskens as Thunderstruck by AC/DC was played. Howard praised Dominic Perrottet’s policies and campaign. “He put forward ideas. He was bold. I particularly admired his stance on poker machines. They are a social evil in this country and I think his stance on that was admirable.” Asked if Perrottet stayed true to conservative values, Howard said: “I think Dom, he got the balance right.” Howard also had some pleasant words for both Perrottet and Labor leader Chris Minns: “The other thing I want to say is I pay tribute to the civil the campaign was conducted by both leaders.” Ayres not conceding Penrith Liberal MP Stuart Ayres is on Sky News now and is not conceding his seat just yet, despite projections Labor has won the seat. Labor MPs dividing up ministries At least one Labor MP is already talking about her colleagues’ portfolios with the party set to form government in NSW. As cheers erupted at ALP headquarters in Sydney on Saturday night, Penny Sharpe confirmed she would be environment minister, Daniel Mookhey would be treasurer and transport would go to Jo Haylen, reports AAP’s Luke Costin. No surprises here – these are the shadow portfolios each of them has held in opposition so they’ll be well versed on their new ministries. Outgoing premier on his way to Liberal party event Dominic Perrottet has just left his home in Sydney’s Hills district and is headed toward the Liberal party’s election night function in the CBD. TV cameras captured Perrottet being driven out of his home a few moments ago. It is a 25 minute drive to the Liberal party function. Terrigal is going down as a Labor gain The Central Coast seat was held by the Liberals’s Adam Crouch on a margin of 12.3%. Crouch has held the seat for three terms. It was considered a Liberal stronghold. Tonight, Labor’s Sam Boughton is projected to win the seat with a 1.5% margin, according to the ABC. No MPs at Liberal function There were still no Liberal MPs present at the party’s major function at the Sydney Hilton at 9PM. The TVs were cut and music turned on shortly after the election was called for a Labor majority. About 100 people were at the event at 9PM after the Liberals had planned to host about 300 of the party faithful. My colleague Michael McGowan, who is at Labor HQ tonight, tells me Dominic Perrottet has called Labor leader Chris Minns to concede. Willoughby appears to be inching towards independent Larissa Penn The ABC is projecting Penn to be ahead of Liberal member Tim James by 1.1%, with about 50% of the vote counted. The ABC is projecting that Penn is “likely” to win the seat, but it’s still one of the seats it considers in doubt. Willoughby had been a safe Liberal seat, held by former premier Gladys Berejiklian. The seat became marginal at the 2022 byelection after her resignation, with James scraping through with a margin of 3.3% over Penn. Prue Car says Labor ‘executed a really good campaign’ Labor’s deputy leader, Prue Car, and now also the incoming New South Wales deputy premier, has told media at the party’s increasingly raucous event in Brighton-Le-Sand that the result tonight proves the party “executed a really good campaign about the issues people are concerned about”. Labor has faced some criticism for running a small-target campaign based on key issues such as privatisation and cost-of-living, but Car said the result “shows that we were listening to people and campaigning on the issues concerning them”. She said: There is a reason that at the Sky News people’s forum [in Penrith] most of the questions to both the premier and Chris Minns were about issues we were talking about.” It feels like it’s a really hopeful night for us and that we’re seeing some really great results. A lot of seats that we needed to win. But we don’t take anything for granted and we still have a lot of seats that are close where there is a lot more to count. It’s clear that the people of NSW have voted for change.” Car, the MP in Londonderry in Sydney’s outer west, said that she was particularly interested in the result in Penrith, where Labor is ahead of Liberal MP Stuart Ayres. I cannot overstate how many resources we’ve thrown at the Liberal Party and Stuart Ayres in Penrith. Wollondilly independent ‘pretty sure’ of victory Independent candidate Judy Hannan is confident she will win Wollondilly and has begun celebrating at the Picton Bowling Club with supporters. She told Guardian Australia there were 40 volunteers already there and more would join soon. She said: We’ve had a look at all the numbers and it’s looking pretty sure. This is huge. It’s a huge swing [and] it’s because nothing got done and it was taken for granted as a safe seat.” The seat was won by Liberal Nathaniel Smith in 2019 with a 5.5% margin after Hannan cut it from 17.3%. Premier-elect Chris Minns on way to ALP function Labor leader Chris Minns has just left his house in southern Sydney and is on his way to Labor’s election night function. Minns didn’t answer questions from journalists as he walked with advisers from his house into a waiting car. Channel Seven is pursuing Minns’ car and broadcasting live vision. The ABC election analyst says he is now “confident” the ALP will be able to form government in their own right. Outgoing minister laments loss of ‘broad church’ Liberal party Over on channel Seven retiring Liberal MP David Elliott is still reminiscing about the John Howard era of his party. Elliott is saying the Liberal party will now need to work out if it wants to be “a western Sydney party” or a “north shore party”, lamenting it had strayed from being the “broad church” it had been in the Howard era. Liberal heavyweight Stuart Ayres is on track to lose his seat of Penrith. Labor’s Karen McKeown is projected to win that. Ayres has held the seat since 2010. Willoughby on knife-edge The seat of Willoughby on Sydney’s lower north shore too close to call. Willoughby had been a safe Liberal party seat, held by former premier Gladys Berejiklian. The seat became marginal at the byelection after her resignation, with Liberal Tim James scraping through with a margin of 3.3% over independent Larissa Penn. Tonight, James and Penn are neck and neck. The ABC has Penn ahead by 0.8%, with about 30% of the vote counted. Postal votes will be significant this election (about 30% of people voted early this election), and postal votes tend to skew conservative. Here’s what we know so far from counting to 8:30PM, with more than 27% of the vote counted: Labor will form government but it’s not yet clear if that will be a majority or a minority government, according to the ABC’s Antony Green. As of 8:30PM, he said it’s looking more like it will be a Labor majority government. Independents have likely gained some seats off the Coalition. In Wakehurst, independent Michael Regan looks to have won the seat from the Liberals, which was held by retiring health minister Brad Hazzard. Wollondilly looks set to be taken by independent Judy Hannan. Labor appears to have gained Monaro from the Nationals and Penrith from the Liberals. Labor will also gain Holsworthy, East Hills, Ryde and South Coast. Update from Tamsin Rose at the Liberal party function: The sound was cut on the large TV screens shortly after the election was called for Labor. The Liberal party is claiming to have retained the teal targets of Vaucluse and North Shore. They have conceded South Coast and Parramatta. Wollondilly will be won by independent Judy Hannan, the ABC are projecting. The seat was held by the Liberals. ‘People picked out of nowhere’: David Elliott savages Liberals’ candidates Retiring Liberal frontbencher David Elliott, on channel Seven’s coverage, was asked what he thought about the prospect of Matt Kean taking over the Liberal leadership from Dominic Perrottet. Elliott said: “It’s no secret that I’ve got a different flavour of liberalism than Matt Kean.” Elliott said the party needed to understand if it had lost key seats by pursuing policies to appeal to potential teal voters. Instead, Elliott said the Liberal party should pursue “positions on issues on what the centre-right, conservative battlers” want. Elliott was also scathing of the quality of candidates preselected this election. “We have people picked out of nowhere for these election campaigns.” “The probity checks just aren’t there.” “That stuff wouldn’t have happened under John Howard.” Antony Green has now called Wakehurst for Michael Regan However, retiring Liberal MP Brad Hazzard all but conceded at 7.45pm saying he would have liked to hand over the seat (past tense). The mood at the Cromer Sports club is jubilant. Regan’s people wear Maroon, not teal, but many of the same environmental and development issues have played out. They are also sick of having road projects postponed, while the bus services seem to have gone downhill, in a region that has no other public transport options. Slew of seats fall to ALP from Coalition: Antony Green ABC election analyst Antony Green says Labor has won the seats of East Hills, Monaro, Penrith, Ryde and South Coast off the Coalition. Update from Tamsin Rose at the Liberal function Not an MP in sight. As at 8PM, with about 17% of the vote counted, the ABC has called: Labor: 39 Coalition: 27 Greens: 2 Others: 6 Labor needs 47 seats to form a majority government. ABC election analyst Antony Green has already said Labor will form government, but is not yet sure if that will be a majority or minority government. Huge swings point to a likely majority government for Labor While Antony Green isn’t ready to call a majority Labor government, we’re seeing the kind of swings that will lead there. The ABC calling the electorate of South Coast - which the Coalition held on a 10.6% margin - with a swing of 16.% so far, suggests as much. As does Parramatta (held on a 6.5% margin) and Monaro (11.6%). Those regional seats are particularly significant because they were held on margins well above the uniform swing Labor needs to govern in its own right. Meanwhile treasurer Matt Kean says on ABC that he would “be happy” for Dominic Perrottet to stay on as leader in opposition “if he wanted to”. Treasurer Matt Kean begins Coalition post mortem On the ABC’s election panel, having heard Antony Green’s prediction, Kean said: “It’s very hard to see a pathway to government for the Coalition.” “It looks headed towards a Labor majority based on those numbers that we’ve just seen. But let’s see what happens.” “There are a number of challenges that we needed to work through. “We really needed everything to go our way… it’s just not.” “We were defending ourselves rather than being on the attack.” Kean played down the impact of internal party dysfunction and Coalition scandals. He said the retirement of popular incumbent MPs such as Brad Hazzard and Victor Dominello were part of the problem. Kean also refused to buy into future Liberal leadership speculation, and whether he would challenge for it. “It’s too early for that.” Liberal party reception cools as seats fall The Liberal camp is feeling increasingly nervous about key seats in western Sydney and the south coast. They remain hopeful about the seats being challenged by teal independents. The vibe in the room has taken a significant dip as seats begin to fall to Labor. The national broadcaster’s election analyst, Antony Green, has said he can “confidently say Labor will form government”, but is not yet sure if it will be a majority or minority government. Channel Seven is projecting a Coalition loss this election. Sky News is saying no Coalition majority is possible. Wakehurst probably changing hands Northern Beaches mayor Michael Regan has likely snatched the once safe Liberal seat of Wakehurst, after the retirement of the health minister, Brad Hazzard. The seat, held by the Liberals with a 21.9% margin, was the first of eight seats being contested by so-called teal independents, to be called. Early country has a 25% swing against the Liberals’ Toby Williams. Scrutineers were reporting the very popular mayor won some of the booths on the coast outright, gaining more than 50% of the vote. The seat overlaps with Warringah, the federal seat that is held by Zali Steggall. Other so-called teal seats are still being counted with Willoughby a possibility to fall to the independent, Larissa Penn. Labor are on track to take Monaro off the Nationals. Labor candidate Steven Whan is set to win that seat from the Nationals Nichole Overall, according to the ABC. This is John Barilaro’s former seat, near the ACT border. Reports Gareth Ward will retain seat Sky News are projecting that Gareth Ward will retain his seat of Kiama. Ward was ousted from the Liberal party and is running as an independent. Federal frontbencher says voters angry at cost of living Federal Liberal MP Angus Taylor is talking to the ABC about his state counterparts’ performance in this election. Taylor said he believed the NSW Coalition were being blamed by voters for cost of living pressures. “People are looking for who to blame” Taylor said it was “tough for incumbent governments”. More on the contest in Wakehurst The health minister, Brad Hazzard, is retiring and so far independent candidate Michael Regan is “looking very strong” (according to Antony Green) to win the seat ahead of the Liberal candidate Toby Williams. That would be the first seat to change hands so far. Anne Davies filed this from Regan’s event earlier. Lake Macquarie independent MP has ‘lines of communication’ with major parties The ABC has spoken to independent MP Greg Piper, who has retained his seat of Lake Macquarie. Asked if he’s had any discussions with either of the major parties heading into tonight, Piper says: We have identified the lines of communication, let’s put it that way. So no discussions, no negotiations, no deals. But we do know, if it comes down to a minority government situation, who it is who’s been delegated from those parties to have those discussions with. Based on the early count, Labor is calling Chris Minns’ seat of Kogarah as a retain. The leader holds one of the most marginal seats in the state on 0.1% after a redistribution, but early counts suggest a strong swing back to Labor in the seat. Labor is also predicting it will retain the seats of Lismore, Coogee, Bega and Strathfield. As of 7:30PM, just over 5% of the vote has been counted It’s still early in the night but some networks have already called a handful of seats and likely results based on these early results. The ABC’s election analyst Antony Green says there is a 6.7% swing towards Labor as it currently stands. He has called the following number of seats for each party, and some of those seats are named below: Coalition: 11 -Cronulla -Davidson -Upper Hunter Labor: 8 -Lismore -Maitland -Charlestown -Bega (likely) -Goulburn (Labor ahead) -Heathcote (Labor ahead) -Ryde (Labor ahead) Independents: 2 -Lake Macquarie (Greg Piper to retain his seat) -Orange (Philip Donato to retain his seat) Wakehurst independent candidate begins afterparty Lots of excitement at the Cromer sports ground’s Far Post. The campaign team seem pretty confident and candidate Michael Regan, the Northern Beaches mayor, has just arrived. Regan is probably the best chance out of the independents who are challenging in safe Liberal seats. Labor’s Janelle Saffin appears to have turned her seat of Lismore into a safe seat for the party. Early counting suggests a swing of about 16% towards Saffin in the seat. Saffin has been vocal for her community in the aftermath of repeated flood disasters in recent years. ‘A genuine contest’ is a win, says Simon Holmes à Court Simon Holmes à Court is playing down the chances of teal candidates as counting ramps up. Holmes à Court, whose fundraising group Climate 200 is supporting a number of candidates particularly in seats on Sydney’s north shore and northern beaches, told channel Seven he’ll be happy even if the efforts of some teal candidates only turns some safe Coalition seats marginal. “Bringing a genuine contest in these seats…that’s a win before we start,” he said. A few seats already called by broadcasters As of 7:15PM, just over 2.1% of votes have been counted. It’s still early days but some networks have already called a handful of seats based on these early results. These are fairly safe seats and don’t say much about the overall direction of the election tonight, but so far the ABC have called four seats for the Coalition and two for Labor. First guests arrive at the near-empty Liberal event The couple walked in holding glasses of champagne and were overheard asking “are we in the wrong place?”. A Liberal staffer reassured them that they were in the right spot. Matt Kean says a Coalition reelection would be ‘an historic victory’ The treasurer, Matt Kean, is on ABC’s election coverage tonight, and has said earlier said “the deck is stacked against” the Coalition tonight. “It would be an historic victory because it hasn’t been done before, four terms, so fighting the tide of history is like fighting gravity. The deck is stacked against us here. It is going to be Mount Everest to climb,” he said. “The challenge for us was to present ourselves as a new government, not the reiteration of a 12-year-old government,” Kean said. Kean also said that in the face of a wave of a “teal onslaught” of challengers in seats on Sydney’s north shore, the Liberal’s “strategy was to take a lot of those issues off the table before the election whether it was climate (or) energy”. “We were focusing on the core equity of the Liberal National brand which is the economy, so from January up to election day it was all about the economy.” David Elliott says ‘not good news’ for Liberal party so far Outgoing Liberal minister David Elliott says early results trickling through suggest poor performances for his party in key western Sydney seats. “Not good news for the Liberal party unfortunately,” he said on channel Seven’s coverage. Elliott said he was hearing of “significant swings in western and northwestern Sydney” and even in Castle Hill “that would suggest to me it could be an early night for a few people in western Sydney”. However Elliott said it was still early in the evening. Important to note that a large number of people have voted early this election. Results for some seats could take a while to become clear. Liberal team will be gathering at the Hilton Party organisers are expecting a few hundred guests including the premier, Dominic Perrottet, later in the evening and hoping other high-profile Liberals including former prime minister, John Howard, pop in. Party faithful are expected to arrive from 7.30. Train service outages hit Sydney In a very Sydney thing to happen on election day – there’s another train outage. Trains are not running on the T1 (western line), T2 (inner west and Leppington line) and T9 (northern line) due to urgent signal repairs at Homebush. There are flow-on effects throughout the network – screens have gone blank at Milsons Point station, for example. In a statement, Transport for NSW has said services on the North Shore, Bankstown, Cumberland, Airport &amp; South, and Central Coast and Newcastle lines are also affected. It has prompted Transport for NSW to issue a warning that anyone travelling to an NRL game at Olympic Park tonight should avoid taking the train. Train outages across the Sydney network have plagued the Coalition in recent weeks. It remains to be seen if they will be punished for the outages at the ballot box. ‘Gina’s an old family friend’ Liberal MP Anthony Roberts has confirmed that Gina Rinehart visited a polling booth in his electorate of Lane Cove today and handed out food. A volunteer who was handing out at Putney Primary told Guardian Australia a white SUV pulled up around 4pm and Rinehart got out to hand Liberal volunteers meat pies. Crossing live to Sky News just now from an election night function in his seat – where he is facing down a tough test from Climate 200-backed independent Victoria Davidson – Roberts confirmed Rinehart’s visit. “Well Gina’s an old family friend,” he said. Roberts said she handed out sandwiches and pies to volunteers of all candidates, not just Liberal volunteers. “In the rain she was out there delivering to all booth workers,” Roberts said. Key seats to watch tonight Here are some of the key seats to keep an eye on as results start coming in: Penrith - held by former deputy Liberal leader Stuart Ayres on a wafer-thin 0.6% margin. Is seen as key for Labor’s chances to win government East Hills - held by Labor on a 0.1% margin. Murray - held by former former Shooters party MP turned independent Helen Dalton on a 2.8% margin. Dalton, her former party and Nationals make this a potential three-cornered contest. Balmain - Held by retiring Greens MP Jamie Parker on a 10% margin. Lane Cove - Held by Liberal frontbencher Anthony Roberts on a 14.7% margin. Being targeted by Climate 200-backed independent Victoria Davidson. Wollondilly - Held by the Liberals on a 6% margin. Also being targeted by a Climate 200-backed independent. Kogarah - Held by Labor leader Chris Minns on a 0.1% margin. Heathcote - Held by the Liberals. But notionally Labor has a 1.7% margin. Leppington - New seat. Notionally a Labor seat with a 1.5% margin. Parramatta - Held by the Liberals on a 6.5% margin. Goulburn - Held by the Liberals on a 3.1% margin. Read more about the key seats to watch TV networks’ live coverage We’ll keep you updated on the results as they come in, but here’s a quick guide for those of you wishing to tune in to the televised coverage at the same time! The ABC’s coverage is being helmed by Sarah Ferguson, with David Speers and - of course - Antony Green leading the panel. Treasurer Matt Kean and senior Labor MP Penny Shape will join the panel. Nine’s coverage is being led by Peter Overton and will feature two former premiers - Labor’s Morris Iemma and Liberal Mike Baird - as well as NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell. Seven will have outgoing Liberal minister David Elliott, Labor frontbencher Jo Haylen and One Nation’s Mark Latham featuring in its coverage, which is being hosted by Amelia Brace and Michael Usher. Kieran Gilbert is helming Sky News’ coverage, which will feature Peta Credlin, Graham Richardson, Joel Fitzgibbon, Barnaby Joyce and NSW metropolitan roads minister Natalie Ward. Latest from Labor HQ Polls have closed across New South Wales and a few staffers are starting to file into the Labor party function at Brighton-Le-Sands in Chris Minns’ seat of Kogarah. The party is favourite to form government - either in minority of majority - ending 12 years in opposition. The final Newspoll of the election has raised hopes within Labor that majority government could be in reach. But the expectation management game is already underway with party figures stressing that with a minimum nine seats required to form majority government and only four Coalition seats with a margin under 5%, it remains a narrow path to victory. One of those seats, Goulburn in the state’s south, has not been held by Labor since 1965. NSW Labor has only formed government twice from opposition, in 1976 and in 1995. On the ABC, Coalition treasurer, Matt Kean, is also talking down the government’s chances of hanging on, saying the “deck is stacked against us” and that the party has “Mount Everest to climb”. Want to know a bit more about who could be the premier after the votes are counted? My colleague Michael McGowan has sat down with both leaders ahead of today’s poll. Read about why Dominic Perrottet has put his career on the line by poking the ClubsNSW beast and how Chris Minns has traded his charming firebrand persona for pragmatic centrism while we wait for the first results from today’s election. Volunteers for Lane Cove ‘teal’ candidate, Victoria Davidson, have told Guardian Australia that booths in Liberal Anthony Roberts‘s leafy north shore seat were visited by mining magnate Gina Rinehart this afternoon. A volunteer called David who was handing out at Putney Primary told Guardian Australia a white SUV pulled up around 4pm and Rinehart got out to hand Liberal volunteers meat pies. David said: She was handing pies to the Liberal volunteers and she was saying what a great job they were doing. She was probably there for 10 minutes or so. Apparently, they were warm, delicious pies. A photo from another booth in the electorate appeared to show Rinehart beside a large white car with Australian flags attached to the top. Guardian Australia has not confirmed with Rinehart herself. The Daily Telegraph reported Rinehart sent Roberts meat pies while he was in Covid isolation in 2021. Will we see a hung parliament? It’ll be about half an hour before we start to see the first results. Labor have been considered favourites heading into today, but polling has been tight. There’s a chance that a winner won’t be clear tonight. A hung parliament is also a strong possibility. The magic number of seats needed to form government is 47. Polls have closed! (for most of the state) Polling stations are about to close for most of the state as we approach 6PM (those in the far west of the state still have an extra half hour before the clock hits six in their time zone). We should see early results start to trickle in from 6:30PM, and we’ll of course bring you that news as it happens. Good evening, it’s Elias Visontay here from the Guardian’s election HQ in Sydney We’ll be bringing you live updates throughout the night as polls close and the counting begins. Our reporters will be at the various parties’ election functions throughout the night and you can read everything they have to say here. If you spot anything – whether at a voting centre or at an election night function – blogworthy, get in touch! You can send through tidbits to me at: elias.visontay@theguardian.com. Brace yourselves for a long night. Giddy up! And with that, I will leave the blog in the hands of Elias Visontay, thanks for reading. Teals in city’s north eyeing a long-game strategy A little way up the north shore, in the seat of Lane Cove there’s also plenty of teal T shirts around, with a little over 200 volunteers across 28 polling places. Lane Cove will be a harder seat for the teals to win, because it stretches west to Gladesville and North Ryde, where the issues of cost of living might overshadow issues of climate change, integrity and the environment. Independent candidate Victoria Davidson said: We are giving it our best shot. Everyone stands on the shoulders of the person before. If we don’t do it this time, we will do it next time. Teals a strong presence at polling booths The teal independents face an uphill battle to win the seats they are contesting thanks to optional preferential voting but they have put on a very strong ground game. Teal T-shirts are in big numbers in the seat of North Shore and at some booths seem to outnumber the Liberal royal blue T-shirts. Independent, Helen Conway, said she has 180 volunteers out staffing 27 booths in the seat of North Shore and had crowdsourced close to the fundraising cap of $193,000 As well as the mainstay teal issues of integrity and action on climate change, Conway says development pressures facing the North Shore have helped her campaign as well. In particular, the Warringah Freeway expansion, which has been causing havoc for commuters over the last couple of months, is a daily reminder. Conway says that for residents in the seat of North Shore – which is at the start of the new expanded freeway- the result could be more traffic not less. Then there is the ongoing unhappiness about the Northern Beaches link, which has resulted in clearing of trees in Cammeray. “The message to the Liberal party is people don’t want to be taken for granted. The problem with Felicity Wilson is she is a post-box not an advocate. She’s missing in action, she’s passive,” Conway said. “This is an aspirational community. They want someone to advocate for them.” she said. The Liberals have had NSW treasurer, Matt Kean co-ordinating, their fightback against the teals. It gives Kean a chance to gather intel on the teal movement, if he chooses to make the move to federal politics, most likely with a run in the overlapping federal seat of North Sydney, currently held by Kylea Tink. Parties still vying for last-minute voters Good afternoon. Polls are still open across New South Wales, and as rain begins to fall across Sydney both parties are doing whatever they can to hoover up the remaining undecided voters. Former prime minister Scott Morrison has been handing out on polling booths in the Sutherland Shire with Cronulla MP Mark Speakman and Miranda MP Eleni Petinos, both safe Liberal seats. Earlier the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was on the hustings in the seat of Balmain, which Labor is hopeful of winning back from the Greens. But election day has not been without incident. In the seat of Port Stephens in the Hunter the local MP, Kate Washington, was filmed in a heated exchange with the One Nation candidate Mark Watson. Footage of the incident taken at a polling booth at Wirreanda Public school, shows the Labor MP exchanging angry words with Watson, accusing him of “calling me a liar”. “What a load of garbage,” she can be heard saying to Watson. Washington declined to comment, but while the full context of the exchange is unclear the Guardian understands the Labor MP has been furious about some of the campaigning tactics used by some of the minor right-wing parties in her seat during the election. Port Stephens is held by Labor on a 5.8% margin. Elsewhere, in the must-win marginal seat of Heathcote covering Sydney’s southern suburbs to the north of the Illawarra, a Labor volunteer appeared to say he would “wait for you” after being told to “fuck off” by a voter. Heathcote is held by Liberal Lee Evans but became notionally Labor’s on a 1.7% margin after a redistribution. It’s a must-win for both parties. The Guardian’s Abhranil Hazra and Jessica Hromas are in the NSW electorate of Epping, currently held by Dominic Perrottet, and they spoke to voters who said they would mostly be sticking with the Liberals. Michaela said she would be sticking with the Liberals, saying she liked their consistency: I don’t think I’ll change my opinion once I get in the booth, I’ll go with the Liberals. This the second time after we got our citizenships we’ll be voting but I think they were fairly consistent with their plans for what I’ve been watching and that’s an aspect that I like, their consistency. Rares told our reporters the work the Coalition did through the pandemic earned them another term: The same, yes, they took the country through covid so its enough. Talking to the voters themselves … At an Epping polling booth, The Guardian’s Abhranil Hazra and Jessica Hromas spoke to voters who said local issues were their main concerns, with many seemingly leaning to voting Liberal. The seat is held by the Liberal premier, Dominic Perrottet, and has never been lost by the Liberal party. Heather O’Sullivan told Guardian Australia that she voted for the Labor candidate, Alan Mascarenhas, as she was opposed to privatisation and felt it was time for “a change”. Hassan, Mona and Muhammad told us they liked Perrottet’s economic policies. Dominic and his policy, from what I’ve seen, I don’t know if I’ll vote for him or not, but at least they’re bringing money into the big projects. The majority of people in the area work 9-5 jobs so, of course, it brings jobs, so he’s supporting big projects whereas Labor is cutting all of those projects, this is difference I can see. Because this Epping area is financially strong, people have more money in their pockets in comparison to other areas in Sydney, they’re educated people, they can find jobs, they can do businesses, and I’m not sure if Alan is the person for us. Angus Taylor defends Peter Dutton’s level of involvement in NSW election The opposition Treasury spokesman says the Coalition leader has been “doing what we’ve got to do at a federal level”. Speaking from the regional seat of Goulburn, Taylor told Sky News that there had been plenty of support for premier Dominic Perrottet from his federal counterparts: Peter is out and about, he is doing what we’ve got to do at the federal level, but there has been no shortage of federal representatives out there over the last couple of weeks and today out on the booths. There’s no doubt it’s going to be tough, an incumbent government with cost of living pressures like we’re seeing at the moment. The Liberal party has a broad church and we have a range of members representing their areas. Scott Morrison on NSW campaign trail Former prime minister Scott Morrison has made a rare appearance today, supporting NSW attorney general Mark Speakman and Liberal MP Eleni Petinos on the campaign trail. Morrison posted a selfie on Instagram with both MPs, cheering his Shire colleagues on: Pleased to be out supporting our local Liberal Shire team today with Mark Speakman and Eleni Petinos MP #keepnswmovingforward. Labor’s Penny Sharpe: ‘a lot of seats that we need to win’ in NSW election Leader of the opposition in the upper house, Penny Sharpe was at Stanmore public school earlier today, where she told reporters she was cautious about the vote, even though polls showed Labor slightly ahead of the Coalition. She also said that key seats Labor needs to win – including Holsworthy, Leppington and East Hills – all featured candidates that were “strong local people”. There are a lot of seats that we need to win or that are on very big margins. So a lot of different contests, which has always been the issue with this campaign. So many different contests, how are they going to fall? Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, bringing you all the latest as polls begin winding down in NSW. That’s it for me today. Mostafa Rachwani will be bringing you the afternoon’s news and the latest from the NSW election, with a few hours left of voting. Sydney to install more statues of women after its public art labelled a ‘sausage party’ A councillor has described Sydney’s public art as “sausage party” amid a campaign to balance gender representation among the city’s public statues. There are just six public statues of women in the city of Sydney, including two of Queen Victoria and one of saint Mary MacKillop. The trend extends across all Australian states. Six out of 33 statues in the city of Adelaide are of women – making it the state with the highest proportion of statues of women. In Melbourne and Brisbane, women make up only 15% of statues. Labor councillor Linda Scott moved a motion for the city of Sydney to set up a public art advisory panel to guide the process of delivering at least three new artworks “celebrating, commemorating or depicting women”. The motion was passed by majority of councillors on 13 March, but there is not yet a timeline of when the artworks will be commissioned. Here’s Scott: When it comes to Sydney statues, it’s unfortunately a bit of a sausage party. There are about five times as many statues of birds in the city of Sydney than there are of women. Analysis – Judgment day arrives for NSW Labor after 12 years in the political wilderness On Friday, as Labor’s election bus took a final, weary lap through a clutch of key seats in Sydney’s west, the upper house MP and unofficial campaign DJ Rose Jackson began blasting One Day More, from the musical Les Misérables. “Tomorrow is the judgment day.” Heavy-handed? Possibly. But after three months of campaigning you can forgive them the obvious metaphor. After 12 long years, Saturday can’t come quick enough for New South Wales Labor. Though polls have tightened in recent weeks, this is an election Labor expects to win. Facing a 12-year-old government beset by scandals, high-profile retirements and on to its fourth premier, anything less would be a disaster. The path to victory is not easy, however. Read the full analysis here: More than 1.5m early votes registered Early voting is becoming increasingly common, as we’ve seen in recent federal and state elections. This has changed the way leaders campaign as they need to convince voters well before polling day. According to the New South Wales Electoral Commission, more than 1.5 million people had already voted in the state election before today. Perrottet sells Coalition’s economic credentials Pink cupcakes, blue shirts and plenty of sausages greeted Premier Dominic Perrottet as he cast his vote in his bid to lead the Coalition to a historic fourth term in power in NSW. Accompanied by his wife Helen and the couple’s youngest daughter, Celeste, the premier said “it’s a very important day for the future of our state – there’s a lot at stake”. Our party has been a team for over 12 years that has transformed NSW ... We’ve turned the economy around, built the schools and hospitals, the trains and motorways that’s transformed people’s lives. He also lauded the Coalition’s economic credentials as getting families through rampant inflation. You can’t support households if you don’t have a strong budget. It is strong economic and financial management that ensures downward pressure on household budgets ... and we’ve done that. - AAP Vote, sausage, swim Is this the most scenic polling booth in Sydney? Labor got in early to take the best real estate at Clovelly surf club. But the mood was upbeat from all sides as they fired up the barbecue and the process of democracy. Voting in your bathers is perfectly acceptable. Just circling back to the prime minister’s press conference earlier today. Anthony Albanese clearly made the case for a change of state government, but his criticism of Dominic Perrottet himself was muted in comparison to his attack on the NSW Liberals. I think New South Wales needs a change of government. You see a government when it’s at the end of its life, when it’s too busy fighting each other. And Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both very good people. I like both of them. I’ve worked closely with Dominic Perrottet, he’s been constructive in his relationships as the New South Wales premier. But the government he leads is a complete shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other and fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting other Nationals, to actually fight for the people of NSW. They’re distracted from the business of delivering better education and health services, and they’re obsessed with privatising essential assets. We can’t afford any more privatisation in NSW. Dutton notably absent on NSW election day The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been missing from the Coalition’s campaign throughout the lead-up to the NSW poll. Premier Dominic Perrottet batted away questions about Dutton’s absence on Saturday, telling Seven’s Sunrise program that he didn’t need a “wingman” for his election pitch: This is an election on NSW issues, it’s a NSW election. Of course, Dutton’s seat of Dickson is in Queensland, which explains why he hasn’t been voting this morning. NSW treasurer Matt Kean has refused to get involved in the consequences of a potential Coalition loss today, saying he won’t comment on whether he would make a leadership tilt. Speaking to Sky News, Kean said premier Dominic Perrottet would remain, “whatever happens tonight”: I’m sure that he’ll continue to keep fighting whatever happens tonight. I intend to ensure that we win government. The key things is that we ensure we hold our heartland seats ... History is against us ... We don’t intend to lose tonight. What I want to do is to make sure we continue to build a strong economy, ... and that’s what I’m going to keep fighting for. Analysis – Peter Dutton risks cementing his reputation as a wrecker Chief political correspondent Paul Karp’s column today is about Peter Dutton and where he finds himself on the voice issue. It’s not clear which way he will swing, but Labor are apparently convinced that he will end up on the no side and therefore increasing their chances of inflicting a damaging defeat on the Albanese government. The leader of the opposition has been engaged in a three-month shadow campaign on the surface demanding details about the voice but in substance raising doubts that drive down support for it. That campaign is now likely to be extended because Albanese opted against proposals to limit the voice’s powers by giving it input into decisions of parliament but not the executive government. The risks of that path are that he dooms the party to cycle of very negative positions which could backfire. The danger for the Liberals is that without proper deliberation they will be locked into opposition for its own sake on big calls that could damage their leader and their brand. Labor has framed the voice as a chance for national leadership from both sides, and urged Dutton not to repeat the mistake of boycotting the apology to the Stolen Generations (for which he apologised). Here’s the full piece again: Australia’s aquaculture industry looks beyond fishmeal to improve sustainability Australia’s growing aquaculture industry is trying to end its reliance on fishmeal in order to become more sustainable. Fish farms have traditionally been reliant on fishmeal, a feed made from small fish such as anchovies which is often fished unsustainably in developing countries. The practice has jeopardised the industry’s environmental credentials, says Ian Urbania, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and founder of non-profit journalism organisation The Outlaw Ocean Project: The whole reason for aquaculture was to slow down ocean depletion. And then they got hooked on feeding and fattening the fish faster. A lot of these fisheries use bottom trawlers with a lot of bycatch, and often smaller species and baby fish, which depletes the ocean more than the wild-catch fishing it was intended to replace. In Australia, where fish farms are steadily overtaking wild-caught fish as the predominant form of seafood production, the industry has worked to move away from the controversial feed product. Co-owners of troubled Queensland coal plant in voluntary administration Plans to bring central Queensland’s troubled Callide C coal-fired power station back online are slated to go ahead despite its co-owners sliding into voluntary administration. The power station near Biloela has been plagued with issues, having catastrophically failed after an explosion in its turbine hall in May 2021. The resulting outage hit more than 470,000 homes and businesses between the NSW border and Cape York. Part of a cooling tower collapsed at the power station in October last year, 16 months after the explosion. Both its C3 and C4 generating units remain offline after the incidents. Deloitte turnaround and restructuring partners Grant Sparks and Richard Hughes were on Friday announced as voluntary administrators over four IG Energy Group entities: IG Power, IG Energy Holdings, IG Power Holdings and IG Power Marketing. - AAP PM avoids the traditional sausage eating snap: ‘It’s not going to happen’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has gone to some length to ensure photographers don’t get a shot of him eating a democracy sausage. He tried shielding the snack with a paper plate before turning around and saying: They’re going to try and get the sausage shot. It’s not going to happen. Perhaps Albanese is eager to avoid the mistake made by former Labor leader Bill Shorten, who inexplicably attacked the sausage from the middle while campaigning. Labor heavyweights join campaign The prime minister and environment minister are out campaigning this morning. Tanya Plibersek is voting in her own electorate of Sydney and is joined by NSW Labor senator Tony Sheldon. Will we get a result on election night? Given the likelihood of a hung NSW parliament, it’s definitely possible we won’t get a final result on election night. According to the NSW Electoral Commission, counting will cease on election night at 10:30pm. Any other vote counting not completed on election night will continue on Monday with no counts taking place on Sunday. More on this here: Why bosses should think twice before those after-hours emails Stepping away from the NSW election for just a moment. Some new research suggests managers should let up on their constant barrage of out-of-hours contact with workers or risk their staff burning out. Researchers from Australia, the US and Europe have found unnecessary and non-urgent contact after workers are supposed to have clocked off is causing elevated stress levels and depressive moods among employees. The Covid-19 pandemic forced people to embrace working from home, bringing the undeniable perks of flexibility and reclaimed commuting time. But the ease of contact in a digitalised workplace is a double-edged sword, with the promise of work-from-home freedom in fact delivering the opposite outcome, according to RMIT researcher Mayowa Babalola: Borderless workplaces are giving managers 24/7 access to employees where constant connectivity with managers is an expectation rather than an option. We found many are realising that the constant ping of (Microsoft) Teams and late-night emails are bringing work stress and depressive symptoms into their personal lives. The collaborative international study, which involved Melbourne’s RMIT among other institutions, surveyed nearly 900 Americans in blue- and white-collar jobs, finding the results were relevant across industries from administration and finance to construction and plumbing. Minns ‘will make a great premier’, Albanese says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has made a few remarks after voting in the electorate of Ryde in Sydney’s north-west. He’s been asked what a Labor victory would mean federally: I’ve worked very closely with Chris [Minns] and we have similar values. I campaigned strongly yesterday, I was in Penrith and Riverstone, the day before I was in Monaro. Today I am in Ryde and Drummoyne and Summer Hill and Balmain. I’ll be out and about because I think he will make a great premier of New South Wales and I hope he is successful. This is a Coalition-held seat. This isn’t my first visit to this seat. I have been here before for two reasons: for the cause of Labor but secondly, Lyndal [Howison] is, I think, just outstanding. I really want to see Lyndal be the member of Ryde because I know the capacity that she will bring to the job. South Australia has recorded its first case of measles in a resident since 2019 after a three-year-old boy was infected. The boy, from regional South Australia, was infected while travelling overseas. SA Health warned anyone who wasn’t fully vaccinated against the measles to keep watch for symptoms over the next few weeks, particularly if they visited certain areas during specific times. The warning areas included Murray Bridge Swimming Centre on Friday, March 17 between 4pm and 6pm, and the Murray Bridge hospital emergency department waiting area on Wednesday, March 22 between 9.30am and 1pm. The boy also visited the waiting area on Thursday, March 23 between 9am and 9.45am. There were two additional warning areas for Thursday: the Bridge Clinic at Murray Bridge between 9.30am and 11.15am, and the Women’s and Children’s hospital emergency department waiting area between noon and 12.45pm. Symptoms start with fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, which were followed by a blotchy rash, SA Health said. The rash usually began on the head and then spread down the body. - AAP Albanese votes with local candidate in Sydney’s north-west The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is voting this morning at the West Ryde Public School with the Labor candidate, Lyndal Howison, and the federal member for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale. We may hear from Albanese after he votes, but likely only a few short remarks if anything. Minns in ultra-marginal East Hills: ‘the voters decide what is a safe seat’ Labor leader Chris Minns is holding a press conference on election day. He has spent the morning so far campaigning in the seat of East Hills, the most marginal electorate in the state held by the Liberals. Here’s a taste of what he said: It’s hard for me to know how many people go to the booth undecided, but they will be met by Labor candidates across New South Wales who are energetic, excited about the future, and I am always amazed when I go to really safe conservative electorates and you have got a bright, bouncy Labor candidate who has put their heart and soul into our message in an electorate that is very, very tough for them to win. Voters have got a funny way of determining what is a safe seat and a marginal seat and as soon as a political party on both sides believes that electorate is in the bag, more often than not the voters rise up and say, we will decide that, not you guys. What is Antony Green looking for? The ABC’s election analyst, Anthony Green, is already in front of the touch screen breaking down the key seats and trends. He’s told the ABC he’ll be looking at some regional electorates to start: I’ll be looking for trends in the country because there are a couple of seats up in the north Tweed and the Murray. The Nationals think they might be able to gain that. If it is close at the end of all that, we’ll be looking at the city. There are some seats in the northern suburbs where there are independents running against the Liberal party. We have a band of seats in Winston Hills, in Parramatta, Penrith, which are all at risk, and a lot in the south. We will be watching all of those seats because the more seats that fall, the more likely you get a majority Labor government. Or will it be a hung parliament? If we will not know the result on the night there could be a negotiation for weeks ahead. Labor posters focus on leader Economics correspondent Peter Hannam has noticed Labor campaign material is highlighting the leader Chris Minns and his leadership team, at least at this polling station in Balmain. Australians don’t want ‘American style’ campaigns with personal attacks, Minns says Earlier we heard from NSW premier Dominic Perrottet, who revealed he exchanged texts with Labor leader Chris Minns last night. The pair wished each other good luck ahead of today’s poll. The text messages are being interpreted by some, including Weekend Today hosts, as a sign of a more civilised election campaign, especially when compared with what we’ve seen at federal elections in recent years. Here’s the exchange: HOST: “It’s been a pretty civilised election campaign Chris. Why do you think that has been the way? Why hasn’t it got personal like it has in other states and federally, do you think? MINNS: Yeah, I think probably because the premier and myself like each other and I think that there’s a common respect there. We’ve managed to keep that for the entire election campaign and I’m hoping it becomes a feature of, if not NSW politics, then Australian politics. You don’t have to take the low road and you don’t always have to, I guess, land a low blow. We can have an argument, if you like, about policies and who has got the better ideas for the future of NSW. So I think it has been a good feature of this election campaign that neither Dom or myself have launched personal attacks. You don’t need to run politics like that. I don’t think we want to go down that American-style democracy where it’s just a fight to the bitter end and there’s no decency among the people who are running against each other. Minns: NSW needs ‘new ideas and new perspectives’ Labor leader Chris Minns spoke to Weekend Today earlier this morning about that Newspoll in the Australian, which projects him to win today’s New South Wales election with a majority of seats. Minns said his team is not taking anything for granted: Polls don’t always get it right. Not everybody’s voted. In fact, most people still haven’t voted yet. No one has been elected. So I can promise everybody who is watching at home today, we are taking absolutely nothing for granted. We know it’s the people of NSW that decide elections and basically polls, at this point, aren’t worth anything because people actually have to get out and vote. So we’re hopeful. We’re going into this election with a hungry but humble philosophy, if you like, but it’s up to the people of NSW and we’re fighting for every vote. Minns was also asked if he and his team were ready to govern the state. It’s been 12 years since Labor were in government in New South Wales. Here’s his response: Absolutely. I’ve got a team that’s committed, united and very disciplined. It’s run an election campaign that has been hopeful and optimistic about what’s possible in NSW. I think what’s required and needed in NSW today is new ideas and new perspectives. Because if we have same policies that we’ve had for the last four years, we will have the same results for the next four years and what people in NSW need at the moment is change. Minns: ‘Feeling good, feeling optimistic’ Labor leader Chris Minns has also addressed reporters while campaigning. Minns was asked about today’s Newspoll, published in the Australian, which found he was “poised to lead the ALP into government after 12 years in the wilderness”. Newspoll’s two-party-preferred result of 54.5-45.5 would represent a 6.5% swing against the Coalition since 2019. He’s what Minns told reporters: Feeling good, feeling optimistic. Now over to the people of New South Wales. REPORTER: Good poll today? There’s only one poll that counts. No, look people have to have their say and with a couple of hours to go, we are urging people to get out and cast a positive vote for change. REPORTER: How many hours sleep? A full night’s sleep. Absolutely. Thanks, guys. REPORTER: Are you going at it until the dying stage? Yeah, absolutely. Dominic Perrottet has given some more expansive comments after voting a short time ago in his seat of Epping. He and Labor leader Chris Minns spoke last night, exchanging text messages and wishing each other good luck. Here’s some more from the premier: It’s a real honour to serve the people of New South Wales. There’s a lot at stake in this election. I will be working hard all day. REPORTER: What would it mean for the Coalition to be delivered a historic fourth term? It’s not about the Liberal or National party. Ultimately, elections are about our people. My team has the plan to deal with the challenges of today, but we’re all wanting to set up the state for the children. REPORTER: The polling suggests that you have done a great job, you are popular. Do you think your baggage, in a way, is actually the Liberal party? That you’re popular but people are reluctant to bring in the Liberal party again? Our party has been here for 12 years, it’s transformed New South Wales. We were the worst performing economy, the state had stalled. We’ve turned that around. We’ve built schools and hospitals, the motorways have transformed people’s lives. But it’s all about the future and where we go from here. I believe my team has the plan, the experience, energy and ideas to take the state forward. Perrottet: ‘It’s a very important day’ Dominic Perrottet has made a few very brief remarks before voting in his seat of Epping in north-west Sydney. Here’s what he said: I love election day. It’s a great day. Ultimately, it’s a very important day for people in New South Wales. It’s a privilege to be the premier of the best state in this country and my team’s got the plan to deal with the challenges of today, obviously New South Wales moving forward and setting it up for our children. Reporter: Did the kids have a message for you this morning? Good luck. Need a quick catch-up on the NSW election? My colleagues Mostafa Rachwani and Abhranil Hazra have compiled a very handy, easy to read, explainer for you. It’s got lots of information about how and where to vote, but also looks at possible outcomes such as: Could the election result in a hung parliament? With a larger number of independents running and hoping to hurt the incumbent government’s chances, there is a high likelihood the election will result in a hung parliament, with neither party able to form majority government. Both Labor and the Coalition require 47 seats to win government, with the Coalition currently sitting on 45 seats, and Labor on 38. It is highly likely the Greens will back Labor to form government, but it could still fall short. If both parties fall short, they will both need to enter negotiations with the crossbench. The Coalition has technically been in minority government since 2021, when MPs John Sidoti and Gareth Ward moved to the crossbench, while Andrew Constance resigned and Labor picked up his seat in a byelection. You can read the full story here: Find your closest polling booth The NSW Electoral Commission is here to help: Australian banks predict another interest rate rise Australia’s big four banks are forecasting future interest rate rises, ignoring bets in financial markets that the cash rate has reached its peak. ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac believe the RBA will lift its key interest rate by at least another 25 basis points, based on economic data already released. Earlier this month, the RBA hiked the rate for a record 10th consecutive time to 3.6%. Investors responded to turmoil in financial markets over the past fortnight by slashing expectations about RBA rate moves, predicting the next move would be lower, after US authorities rescued Silicon Valley Bank and two others and the Swiss government helped UBS take over the ailing financial services company Credit Suisse. However, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and even the Swiss National Bank each lifted official interest rates this week, viewing the fight against inflation higher priority than easing the squeeze on their respective economies. Australia’s main commercial banks think the RBA have at least as much reason to stay on its inflation-beating course given the relative stability of the country’s financial system. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, this week said he was receiving twice-daily briefings and that “our banks are well-regulated, well-capitalised and highly liquid and are in a better position than most to deal with these disruptions”. The democracy sausages are sizzling If you’re out voting in NSW this morning, let us know what’s going on. Voting under way in NSW Voting is under way in NSW, with more than 4 million people across the state set to decide who will form government for the next four years. By Friday close to a quarter of the state’s 5.5 million voters had cast their ballots, AAP reported, with nearly 1.2 million people pre-polling and 92,000 lodging postal votes. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the Labor leader, Chris Minns, have campaigned hard in key seats in western Sydney, where one in 10 Australians live and could well decide the election result. Perrottet is expected to vote in his seat of Epping, in Sydney’s north-west while Minns will cast his vote in the seat of Kogarah, in the city’s south, which he holds by a 0.1 per cent margin. The premier is seeking a fourth consecutive four-year term for his Liberal-National coalition on a platform of responsible financial management he says would fund life-changing infrastructure. It would be the first time the party has managed the feat since 1973. Western Sydney ‘a tight contest’ Western Sydney could be key to the NSW election result today. As Andy Marks from Western Sydney University explains, there are a number of seats in play. Here’s what Marks told ABC News a short time ago: Election time is our time to shine in western Sydney, it seems. It’s always a tight contest. This time round, it’s no different. There’s roughly about seven seats that are in play. So its common place to see politicians on every corner. You’ll notice that a lot of the big announcements have been made in western Sydney, both major parties camped out there for a few weeks. Marks said it was difficult to call who would win the majority of seats in western Sydney. Polling has taken a battering as well, since the Morrison victory against the odds. It’s very difficult to gauge whether or not the polling is accurate. And also, this is different because it’s a bit of a street by street contest. Neighbourhood issues that are bubbling up as opposed to the big ticket stuff. Share market falls for seventh straight week The local share market has endured its seventh consecutive losing week as interest rate hikes and fears about the stability of the global banking system weighed on sentiment. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished the trading week yesterday afternoon down 13.4 points, or 0.19%, to 6,955.2, after having been down as much as 0.65% in the first 15 minutes of trading, Australian Associated Press reports. For the week the ASX200 lost 39.6 points, or 0.57%. Its seven-week losing streak is its longest such stretch since nine consecutive weeks of losses during the global financial crisis in mid-2008. Recent weeks have seen the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and the Swiss investment bank, Credit Suisse. On Friday shares in Deutsche Bank, another European investment bank that has struggled since the GFC, fell 14%. Overnight the Bank of England raised rates by 25 basis points, a widely anticipated move after official data released Wednesday showed higher than expected inflation, with consumer prices rising 10.4 per cent in the year to February. While some economists have suggested that the global banking chaos might prompt the Reserve Bank to pause its rate hike campaign at its next meeting a week from Tuesday, Tadgell said he thought it was “highly probable” that Australia’s central bank would again hike rates. The ASX’s 11 official sectors were mixed on Friday, with five gaining ground and six losing it. On Friday, NAB was the biggest loser among the Big Four banks, falling 1.6% to $27.18. CBA dropped 1.2% to $95.84, ANZ retreated 1.1% to $22.52 and Westpac subtracted 0.6% to $21.20. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage on a day that will be dominated by the state election in New South Wales. The election promises to be the closest for 16 years following a run of fairly comfortable Coalition wins. Labor, under the leadership of Chris Minns, believes it will end its 12-year stint in the wilderness but the Coalition is pinning its hopes on premier Dominic Perrottet’s disciplined campaign. The final Newspoll of the election pointed to a Labor win by 54.5% to 45.5%, a 6.5% swing since the 2019 election and enough to secure 10 seats. Can they do it? Here’s everything you need to know about the big day. A constitutional expert has described the proposed the proposed Indigenous voice as a “safe and sensible” legal option, dismissing concerns that the advisory body would be too powerful. George Williams, professor of law at the University of New South Wales, says the change is “strikingly modest” and “should remove doubts that parliament is fettered or limited”. Our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, writes today that opposition leader Peter Dutton faces a dilemma about whether to support the reform. Go with yes and he risks being sidelined. Back a no vote and he will cement his reputation as a wrecker. The Australian stock market could be in for another sticky day on Monday after shares fell sharply again in Europe overnight amid continued fears about the banking system. In Friday’s session in Sydney, the ASX fell for the seventh week running and it was down by 0.19% on the day. Futures point to the index opening down 1% on Monday morning. It comes as Australian banks think the RBA will raise rates again a week on Tuesday despite the market turmoil which some have speculated might bring an end to the record 10 successive months of hikes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/08/strikes-at-drax-power-plant-may-cause-power-cuts-in-uk-says-union","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-08T13:31:42Z","webTitle":"Drax power plant workers to strike nine times in three months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/08/strikes-at-drax-power-plant-may-cause-power-cuts-in-uk-says-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/08/strikes-at-drax-power-plant-may-cause-power-cuts-in-uk-says-union","fields":{"bodyText":"Workers at one of Britain’s biggest power plants are preparing to go on strike nine times over the next three months in a dispute over pay. More than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, plan to strike in February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal. Unite union has accused Drax of “classic corporate greed”, citing an increase in its profits, which jumped to £200m in the first half of its financial year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, helped by high electricity prices. Unite said it had rejected an 8% pay rise and noted that the retail prices index (RPI) inflation rate was 13.4% in December. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a classic case of greed by a company which is already generating eye-watering profits. Drax is cynically seeking to boost its bonanza profits further by forcing workers to take a real-terms pay cut. “Unite is now totally focused on the jobs, pay and conditions of its members and the workers at Drax will be receiving the union’s complete support.” Unite claimed strike action would shut down Drax – which supplies about 6% of Great Britain’s power at times – and cause power cuts. The company refuted this claim and said it had “robust plans in place to ensure the power station continues to safely generate renewable electricity for millions of homes and businesses” in the event of industrial action. A Drax spokesperson said: “We are deeply disappointed that Unite is planning to go forward with this unnecessary action which will see colleagues lose money instead of securing a significant pay rise. Drax remains open to dialogue with Unite to avoid industrial action. “There are three trade unions representing colleagues at Drax power station and this offer has been accepted by Prospect, while GMB has stated it will not be taking industrial action.” Drax, which has faced criticism over its use of biomass, said it had offered employees £2,000 each in recognition of their work extending the life of two coal units until March 2023. The units have been kept on standby at the request of National Grid. The strikes at Drax are due to take place on 20 and 27 February; 6, 13, 20 and 27 March; and 4, 10 and 17 April. The dispute echoes a standoff at UK Power Networks (UKPN), which supplies power to London and the south-east of England. Unite said on Monday said that 1,300 workers at the company would be balloted for strike action as they were unhappy with a pay rise of 7% for the current financial year. Unite has previously accused UKPN and other networks of “rampant profiteering”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/the-power-to-rabbit-hole-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-24T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"The Power to Rabbit Hole: the seven best shows to stream this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/the-power-to-rabbit-hole-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/the-power-to-rabbit-hole-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week","fields":{"bodyText":"Pick of the week The Power Imagine a world in which men are physically afraid of women? It might be an understandable revenge fantasy but this sci-fi – based on Naomi Alderman’s 2016 Margaret Atwood-endorsed novel and starring Toni Collette – suggests what such a world might look like. The power in question is electricity: teenage girls discover they have the ability to unleash deadly bolts from their hands. There are tentative explorations (starting fires, turning on lightbulbs) then escalations – two girls shut down a city’s energy grid. But where will this end? After all, power corrupts. The show initially struggles to establish a tone, but the premise is interesting enough to make it worth sticking with. Prime Video, from Friday 31 March *** Rabbit Hole Kiefer Sutherland rolls back the years in this new thriller, playing John Weir, a similarly hyper-efficient, high stakes operative to 24’s Jack Bauer, and working in the comparably perilous world of corporate espionage sabotage. As we join Weir, he’s smugly decimating the fortune of a passing tech investor before engaging in no-strings sex with a woman he meets in a bar. But though he’s cagey, unattached and enigmatic, he’s leaving trails: soon he’s in the crosshairs of a mysterious operation intent on destroying his livelihood and framing him for murder. It’s slick, slightly generic and enjoyably nasty. Paramount+, from Monday 27 March *** The Big Door Prize Would you live your life differently if you fully understood your true potential? When a mysterious machine appears in the convenience store of a small US town promising to reveal every individual’s capabilities, the locals are seduced. They’re soon buying themselves the motorbike they’ve always fancied, learning judo and taking up artistic hobbies. At the heart of the action is Chris O’Dowd’s gently bumbling teacher Dusty, who is worried about the machine’s potential to unbalance previously tranquil lives. A slow burn but the intrigue ramps up. Apple TV+, from Wednesday 29 March *** Kindred Explorations of US racial faultlines via the medium of fantasy has become a mini-genre in recent years (think 2020’s Lovecraft Country). This feels like a slightly baggy addition to that canon. Adapted from Octavia E Butler’s 1979 novel, Kindred tells the story of writer Dana (Mallori Johnson) whose nightmares about living during the era of slavery start to become so horribly real they resemble time travel. When her white boyfriend Kevin finds himself in this parallel universe too, the potential for troubling allegory is rich. Disney+, from Wednesday 29 March *** Wellmania Adapted from Brigid Delaney’s 2017 novel, this comedy-drama stars Celeste Barber as Liv Healy, a deeply unhealthy Australian food blogger who is denied a US green card on the grounds of unfitness. Via a mixture of gross-out comedy and snarky scepticism, it tracks her journey through various wellness fads as she attempts to reclaim her career. However, in an awkward – albeit predictable – tonal shift towards earnest, feelgood redemption, it turns out her problems aren’t just physical; she’s going to have to address difficult emotional issues, too. Netflix, from Wednesday 29 March *** Unseen A simple premise for this intriguing South African crime thriller: Zenzi Mwale (Gail Mabalane) is a timid cleaner whose husband is being released from prison. When she arrives to pick him up, she is told that he’s already gone. But where? And, more importantly, why? Initially, Zenzi struggles to be taken seriously by either the authorities – to whom she first turns – or the criminal underworld where her focus inevitably shifts. But just because she’s quiet, that doesn’t mean she’s going to give up. Eventually, her quest takes her into dangerous realms.

Nelson Mandela had been released from Robben Island after almost three decades, exiles were beginning to return, and political negotiations had begun to determine how decades of white minority rule would be ended without a massive loss of life. Those negotiations were tense and difficult, continually undermined by rightwingers who were hellbent on holding on to apartheid. Each time there was progress, the Conservative party and a range of white supremacist groups would question the authority and the legitimacy of FW de Klerk, the then president of the country. They caricatured him as an elitist, arguing that “ordinary” white people – those working on farms and far away from the big cities – had not been consulted on these changes. They insisted that De Klerk was acting on his personal beliefs, but had no mandate to negotiate away white minority rule. In order to address these charges, De Klerk decided to hold a referendum, in which he would ask white South Africans whether they gave his government permission to continue on the path of ending apartheid. The question white voters had to decide on was: “Do you support the continuation of the reform process that the state president started on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?” The stakes were high. De Klerk needed the space to negotiate with the African National Congress (ANC) and other liberation forces in good faith. If he won, and the country voted “yes,” De Klerk would neutralise his rightwing opponents and be free to sit at the table and work out the details of a new constitution. On the other hand, if he lost on the basis of the “no” campaign winning, De Klerk promised he would resign as president and new elections would be called. The ANC was in a difficult position. A whites-only vote flew in the face of the principles it had fought for since it was founded in 1912. Asking white people to vote to determine the future of a Black population that did not have the right to vote felt counterintuitive and morally questionable. And yet, as Mandela and others argued, a “no” vote would reverse the entire negotiation process and plunge the country into chaos. If Black and white could not sit at a table and craft a new future together, they would be forced to do battle in the streets. The time had come for change, and the choices were stark. Even racists recognised that white minority rule was no longer tenable. And so, a broad coalition of future-minded realists began the task of campaigning hard for a “yes” vote. Big business, including companies like Standard Bank, Anglo American and others, formed an alliance and supported the yes campaign. They took out ads in the papers arguing that after years of international condemnation, since Mandela’s release in February 1991, capital was finally flowing back into the country and sanctions were being lifted. A “No” vote would threaten these gains. Their arguments were reinforced by the international community, which made it clear that if white South Africans voted “yes,” the remaining economic and sporting sanctions would fall away almost immediately. If they wanted to turn back the clock and cling to their ways, the world would respond accordingly. In March 1992, the results of the referendum were made public. White people had voted yes, giving De Klerk the mandate to go back to the negotiating table with Mandela. A mere two years later, South Africans of all races voted in a historic set of elections. That jubilant day would not have been possible without that yes campaign. White South Africans who voted “yes” did so for many reasons. Some did it out of a sense of human connection, others for more pragmatic reasons – a South Africa shackled to its past would never address the massive problems of Black unemployment and poverty. Regardless of their reasons, the outcomes were undeniably positive. A single sentence allowed the country to move on to address much bigger systemic problems. South Africa is not a perfect country, but its story of transition offers many lessons. And yes, there are many differences, but the similarities between my home country and the one in which I now live, are too obvious to dismiss. In October this year, a largely non-Indigenous electorate will vote on an amendment to the Australian constitution that has profound implications for the relationship Indigenous people have with the state. This is precisely what was at stake – in dramatic form – in South Africa. Thirty years ago, as a young woman, I raged against the notion that white people held my future in their hands. I found the idea appalling. Over time, I have come to realise how wrong I was. The power to change South Africa was never in white hands. The power to shift the conversation lay in the hands of all those who understood the necessity of change. The power to change South Africa lay with Black South Africans and their allies, who were the architects of the soaring constitution that remains an inspiration to so many today. Voting Yes affirms this country’s willingness to recognise – permanently and irrevocably – that what was done to Aboriginal people cannot be addressed in piecemeal and ad hoc ways that are subject to the whims of politicians. At the moment there is much attention focused on those who scream “no” when all around them others are quietly saying yes. Voting “yes” offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove that the voices of the naysayers may be loud, but their numbers are smaller than we might imagine.

Some time in the early 2030s, Australia will take possession of its first nuclear-powered submarines. Then, around a decade later, we hope to deliver the very first nuclear-powered sub built on home soil. It’s being described as a “new dawn” for defence policy and the journey is under way as Anthony Albanese meets Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak in San Diego. We’ve got full coverage of the announcement, and the reaction to this huge, expensive and globally consequential deal. Back home, Indigenous leaders have voiced some sharp criticisms of opponents of the voice to parliament. And bank shares could come under pressure as the fallout from the biggest financial collapse since 2008 continues. Australia ‘White saviours’ | Conservatives raising doubts about the voice to parliament have been accused of deliberately finding flaws with the proposal “just to stay in the spotlight”, according to a member of the government’s advisory group (pictured). Another group member, Prof Marcia Langton, called it a “relentless scare campaign”. Aukus pact | Australian taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars as the prime minister prepares to announce the new Aukus submarine deal with the US and UK in San Diego this morning. It will mean a “substantial” spending commitment over decades – Peter Dutton thinks it should come from NDIS cuts – and will also involve more “rotational” visits to Australia by US and UK submarines. The UK is itself getting Aukus subs, which should hit the water by the end of the 2030s. Here’s an explainer on all you need to know. Emissions push | Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. Plastic plan | Thousands of tonnes of soft plastic that was collected and dropped off by supermarket customers and has been stockpiled since the collapse of a domestic recycling program could be be shipped to the US for processing. ‘It’s over’ | Conservationists are confident that a five-year hunt for the remaining feral fox in the Pilliga Scrub area of New South Wales – nicknamed Rambo – has ended in its death, paving the way for the greater bilby to flourish again. World China ‘irreversible’ | Xi Jinping has placed the issue of Taiwan at the centre of his third term in office and appeared to be asserting China’s “irreversible” role on the global stage in a speech in Beijing. Ukraine struggle | Amid reports that Xi will start cementing that role with a visit to Russia as early as next week, Kremlin forces are still locked in a brutal struggle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Paper problem | All toilet paper from across the globe checked for toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” contained the compounds, with the waste probably creating a significant source of water pollution, according to research. Attenborough warning | Sir David Attenborough has warned that “nature is in crisis” and is being destroyed at a “terrifying rate”, but said the world had the solutions to solve the problem. ‘Surreal few days’ | Football fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief after the BBC and Gary Lineker agreed that the star presenter would return to present Match of the Day following his suspension for an anti-government tweet. But the row could still see Tory-supporting BBC chair Richard Sharp forced to quit. Full Story Israel, the West Bank and a week of rampage Escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is happening amid unprecedented anti-government protests. It’s no coincidence, reports Bethan McKernan. In-depth Australian banking shares are likely to come under pressure today as financial stocks in the US and Europe fell sharply again in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has now been bought by HSBC for £1. Interest rates could stop rising sooner than thought because of the crisis, economists have said, with the US Fed already believed to be considering moderating its next expected hike to protect the markets. Here’s an explainer to help understand what’s going on, while our US columnist Robert Reich thinks deregulation is to blame.

As Jonathan Horn observes wryly, with two days before the season’s first bounce, the suave McLachlan probably didn’t have “undertaking decolonisation” on his final to-do list. The world of sport Cricket | Australia have lost four Test series in a row against India after the fourth Test in Ahmedabad was drawn. They have an early chance for revenge in the world championship final in England in June, and their tenacity in India might prove decisive. Baseball | Australia have made history by reaching the World Baseball Classic quarter-finals for the first time after beating the Czech Republic in Tokyo. Ashes | David Saker, the renowned fast bowling coach, has agreed to work for England in this year’s Ashes series. Media roundup Leading children’s authors, Andy Griffiths and Jackie French, have condemned the “sensitivity” rewrites of Enid Blyton’s books, the Australian reports. Radio equipment that caused a meltdown on Sydney trains last week has been obsolete for a year, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, while in Victoria the Basketball League is set to allow a transgender player to compete in the women’s competition, the Herald Sun says. Brisbane has seen a medical “miracle”, the Courier Mail says, after the state’s first ever birth via a partial ovarian transplant.

Two units at Drax in Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Nottinghamshire were asked to fire up just before midnight on Wednesday. The West Burton unit was stood down at 5.13am, and the Drax units were later also informed they would not be called into action. It was the third time in a week that the National Grid’s Electricity Supply Operator (ESO) had asked coal-fired stations to warm up in case they were necessary. The units have been placed on standby as a contingency plan amid fears over blackouts this winter. National Grid has been active in balancing the UK’s energy supplies in recent days as it copes with colder, less windy weather, which pushes up energy use and causes power generation from wind to drop. However, the ESO said the latest warm-up instruction was not a response to the recent UK cold snap. Instead it came after the French grid operator RTE said assistance may be required after it was informed of strike action affecting electricity generation on Thursday that “could place their network in an alert status”. It was later decided they were no longer needed “following analysis of network margins”. Britain’s electricity supplies are connected to France through subsea interconnector cables, which allow power to flow between the countries when there is demand. The ESO said the coal plants would have been available to help generate power for France only if they were not needed to prevent power cuts in Great Britain. National Grid has also been running its demand flexibility service for the first time this month outside trials. The service involves energy suppliers paying some households with smart meters for energy reductions, helping to reduce peak demand, which means it has less need to draw on more polluting energy sources when energy use rises in the evenings. Some businesses were already paid to reduce energy use. In total, National Grid is expected to pay just over £3m to suppliers for the service on two days this week, with about £850,000 on Monday and £2.1m for the longer session on Tuesday. In the future, the service is likely to be much more widespread and electric cars and home batteries will play an increasing role in balancing the grid. Drax, the owner of the Yorkshire units, and West Burton, which is owned by France’s EDF, agreed in the summer to extend the lives of their coal-fired generation units through the winter in exchange for fees as the UK government looked to shore up energy supplies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The two plants had been due to close their coal operations in the autumn to reduce use of the more polluting fuel, but Drax and EDF agreed to keep them open until at least March if needed by National Grid. An ESO spokesperson said: “In support of mutual co-operation between Great Britain and its neighbouring electricity networks the ESO answered France’s request for additional GB generation to be able to provide assistance today if required by warming the contingency coal units. “The ESO was able to take this action to support the French network in avoiding consumer disconnections, as the GB network is currently operating as normal and this action would not have placed GB consumers at risk. Following further assessment of network margins in both countries the ESO has now stood down these coal units.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/02/britains-bunkers-offer-little-chance-of-survival-after-a-nuclear-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T17:09:06Z","webTitle":"Britain’s bunkers offer little chance of survival after a nuclear attack | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/02/britains-bunkers-offer-little-chance-of-survival-after-a-nuclear-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/02/britains-bunkers-offer-little-chance-of-survival-after-a-nuclear-attack","fields":{"bodyText":"The owner of the Kelvedon Hatch bunker suggests that those selected for his shelter might survive for 10 to 20 years in it while avoiding nuclear fallout (‘When you hear the four-minute warning’ … Whatever happened to Britain’s nuclear bunkers?, 24 November). This is, sadly, an unrealistic expectation if one simply looks at the likely impact on infrastructure of even a limited nuclear attack on the UK, based on exercises and analysis conducted during the cold war. It was accepted 50 years ago that nobody above ground is likely to be left fit or alive to generate power or supply clean water. Food cannot be grown in a radioactive environment and, in the period preceding any outbreak of war, there will be diminished food stocks due to panic buying or rationing. The scenarios modelled by civil defence analysts even during the 1980s Pershing and cruise missile deployment suggested that survival in Britain’s local government bunkers would be short lived. There was never any provision in the UK for sheltering the civilian population in the event of a nuclear conflict and Britain’s civil defence posture was abandoned as a posture after the 1960s. While in neutral Sweden and Switzerland housebuilding rules made provision to protect the civil population, in Britain the idea of being able to survive to the same extent as in, say, the blitz in the second world war is merely a pious hope.

The party is also considering allowing universal credit claimants to undertake far more comprehensive programmes of study and training opportunities while continuing to claim benefits. The policy is likely to be adopted based on two key reports by Gordon Brown and David Blunkett, which will the building blocks for Labour’s manifesto offer. Alison McGovern, the shadow employment minister, said there was very little engagement from the Department for Work and Pensions about how jobcentres could match the local skills needed, and that local authorities were best placed to overhaul what employment support was on offer. “To grow our economy, every place needs an economic plan. We want to grow the economy across the country and make sure everybody feels the benefit. You cannot do that without local places being in the lead,” McGovern said. “At the moment, too much of DWP’s policy is made in a high-handed way from Whitehall, whereas we want to learn the lesson from the places that do it best and make sure every place has a really good plan for jobs for all its people.” Brown’s Commission on the UK’s Future said the devolution of Jobcentre Plus should mean they become a hub for local employers – open to those looking to upskill, re-enter the workplace later in life or after childcare responsibilities, or start businesses and resources for civil society, trade union and private sector support. It said that health services should have closer connections to job support and they should be data hubs for local market information. Blunkett’s learning and skills report also recommends funding people to study with agreed providers and that the DWP “should allow people to study full or part-time, whilst on benefits for an agreed course”. Under the current system, there are limits on the ability of people to train and study and continue to receive universal credit. Many experts have cited the requirement for people to spend a minimum amount of time each week looking for work, which limits the ability for full-time skills training or study. A study by the Work Foundation this year found many universal credit claimants voicing frustration that they were not being signposted to adequate training to allow them to build long-term careers in sectors. In cases where people were able to undertake part-time training, most of those cited in the study said they were still having to spend between 16 and 35 hours each week looking for work so they could keep receiving benefits. McGovern, the MP for Wirral South, said that it was self-evidently wrong that people were being penalised for wanted to improve their skills. She said that top-down scripts delivered to work coaches from Whitehall would never be flexible enough to match local skills gaps or help people into long-term skilled jobs. “My frustration is that DWP doesn’t engage in the conversations at all about the big initiatives that are happening between councils, skills centres or big developers. All their policies are set by Whitehall. The conversations people have with work coaches are all driven by Westminster,” she said. McGovern, a former Southwark councillor, said councils were often already building their own initiatives to try to bridge the gap locally. “It’s not the jobcentre sitting with skills centres or employers working out who might fit where. Southwark council have created a whole new body – Southwark Works – to backfill what DWP should be doing. “We should empower local authorities to look at what the opportunities are – every sector has labour shortages – and let towns and cities work it out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"US ranking on abuse of power index hurt by inequality and violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","fields":{"bodyText":"The US scores surprisingly badly in a new ranking system charting abuses of power by nation states, launched by a group co-chaired by former UK foreign secretary David Miliband. The US comes close to the median of 163 countries ranked in the Index of Impunity, reflecting a poor record on discrimination, inequality and access to democracy. The country’s arms exports and record of violence are an even bigger negative factor. The US ranks worse on impunity than Hungary and Singapore, one a poster child for democratic backsliding and the other an illiberal democracy. The UK performs creditably at 147, only 26 rankings away from the most accountable state. Its score is brought down by its protection of offshore tax havens that facilitate tax abuse in other countries. Former colonies, many affected by the slave trade, fare poorly in the index, suggesting the experience of imperialist subjection has caused a continuing damaging legacy. Nearly all of the top 20 ranked in the index in terms of impunity are former colonies or touched by colonialism. The findings are likely to stimulate the already fraught questioning of the presumed superiority of the west, an issue that bedevils debate at the UN and has come to dampen some of the expected support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. But the index will provide little ammunition for Russia, which ranks 28 out of 160 states, the highest level of impunity in its region, and the result of poor scores for conflict and violence, environmental degradation, abuse of human rights and unaccountable governance. China also performs poorly, at number 48. The work, launched ahead of the Munich Security Conference, has been prepared by an international group co-chaired by Miliband, the former British foreign secretary, and Prof Mónica Pinto of the University of Buenos Aires in collaboration between the Eurasia Group and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. The authors say the concept of impunity is the exercise of power without accountability, which becomes, in starkest form, the commission of crimes without punishment. The report says: “There are good grounds to fear we are entering a global ‘age of impunity’, in which ‘the rules are for suckers and civilians pay the price’.” It argues that “while the impunity of invading a neighbour or bombing a hospital, contrary to international law, is not yet normalized, the abuse of power is increasingly evident: climate change on the march; autocrats on the rise; and the rules-based-order in retreat. The documentation of the scale of that abuse, in each country in the world, is the purpose of this index.” The authors argue their chosen analytical frame could be a better way of understanding and measuring what is happening in the world today than democracy v autocracy, left v right, or east v west. The authors say it aims to capture the multidimensional nature of global challenges ranged across five main dimensions - governance and human rights, economic inequality, environmental damage, adherence to norms in times of conflict, and the linkages between a country’s domestic politics and its impact abroad. For each of the five dimensions, the authors examined up to 17 different independent credible datasets to measure impunity across each dimension, so making it possible to produce an overall score and ranking for each country in the world. Among the most powerful countries in the international system, Germany and Japan perform the best, benefiting from their lack of direct involvement in the types of conflicts that hurt the scores of more militarised powers, including the US and Russia. Broadly, high income liberal democracies perform well with Nordic countries Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway scoring the best rankings in the index. Environmental degradation is where impunity continues to thrive, even among otherwise accountable societies. For instance Canada, which is one of the best performing countries overall on the index at 22, is in the top quartile of countries for environmental degradation. The study implicitly challenges the framework of democracy versus autocracy set by the US president, Joe Biden, through his democracy summit last year. It argues: “Emphasizing the centrality of democracy alienates the many societies that do not operate under the principles of democratic governance and yet still care about constraining power. It also misses the internal debates over accountability that can happen within both democratic and non-democratic societies.” The index shows, for instance, that countries such as India, Israel, Malaysia, or the US are self-evidently democratic, but do not score well on human rights. Miliband said: “Impunity means the decision to launch a missile attack on a hospital in north-west Syria. It means the decision to prevent the transfer of critical aid into Yemen or within Ethiopia. It means the daily rocket attacks against civilian housing in Ukraine. “Impunity is not just the commission of crimes – which in conflict zones means war crimes – without punishment. It is the exercise of power without checks and balances on the abuse of power. And while the abuse of power in war zones is most extreme, it is not the exception. When I say we are living in an age of impunity, I mean we are living at a time when critical checks and balances on the abuse of power – by governments, by business, by private citizens – are in retreat.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/06/electric-vehicles-rise-uk-car-sales-smmt-inflation-interest-rates","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-06T11:35:28Z","webTitle":"Electric vehicles power rise in UK car sales despite weak outlook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/06/electric-vehicles-rise-uk-car-sales-smmt-inflation-interest-rates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/06/electric-vehicles-rise-uk-car-sales-smmt-inflation-interest-rates","fields":{"bodyText":"Sales of electric vehicles fuelled the strongest start to the year for the UK car market since before the coronavirus pandemic, although the forecast for annual sales has been cut as increasingly cash-strapped consumers delay big-ticket purchases. Almost 132,000 new cars were sold in the UK in January, up 14% year on year and a sixth consecutive month of growth. The figures mark the best start to the year since 149,279 new cars were sold in January 2020. However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has reduced its forecast of annual UK new car sales to 1.79m, a 0.8% reduction from its prediction in October, citing a weak economic outlook for this year. Total new UK car sales this year are expected to be up by 11% compared with 2022 – which at 1.6m fell to the lowest level since 1992 – and a further recovery to 1.96m is expected for 2024. The SMMT said the expected growth in UK car sales “bucks the national trend” as businesses and consumers cope with soaring inflation and a run of interest rate rises fuelling a cost of living crisis. “The industry and market are in transition but [is] fragile due to a challenging economic outlook, rising living costs and consumer anxiety over new technology,” the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said. The latest SMMT snapshot shows that electric vehicle sales continue to underpin overall growth. Sales of hybrid vehicles rose by 40.6% year on year in January, with sales of battery models climbing by a fifth, accounting for 14.4% and 13.1% of all sales respectively. Sales of petrol vehicles rose 14.6% year on year, accounting for 44.7% of all new cars sold in January, while diesel declined by 12%. The 4.3% year on year drop in sales to private buyers shows the increasing economic pressure on household budgets. “Welcome though it is, the surge in sales is partly a case of the market playing catch-up, as manufacturers work through the backlog of orders that were placed, but not fulfilled, last year as supply chain disruption held back the supply of new cars,” the director of AA Cars, Mark Oakley, said. “Looking ahead, the key question for buyer demand will be the extent to which the rising cost of living impacts people’s willingness to commit to big-ticket purchases like a brand new car.” Last month, the SMMT released data that showed total UK vehicle production slumped to a 66-year low in 2022, down almost 10% on 2021 and 40.5% compared with before the pandemic in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:15:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear powers are on a deadly path to more conflict | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","fields":{"bodyText":"Truly, the human race has a death wish.

Data from the electricity system’s administrator, Elexon, showed the Coryton power station in Essex had bids accepted to produce power at £1,950 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Tuesday evening. The sums are well above average prices of between £200 and £400 per megawatt hour, although they remain below those paid on 12 December, when National Grid paid £27m in a single day to get power stations to crank up supply. In December, Rye House power station in Hertfordshire received a record £6,000 a MWh. In total, the cost of balancing the system on Tuesday this week was estimated at between £5m and £10m. One industry source said the price of sourcing power from gas peaking plants had “raised eyebrows”. The cold, still weather reduced wind power and pushed up demand this week, while strikes at EDF’s nuclear plants in France also put a strain on the grid. To counter this, National Grid called on coal plants that were put on standby for the winter into action for the first time, as well as sourcing power from Dinorwig, a vast, pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales nicknamed “Electric Mountain”, which is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Industry sources said Coryton, owned by InterGen, could have earned as much as £2m on Tuesday but failed to deliver all of the power originally offered up. InterGen was bought by Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group in January. National Grid relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Generators bid to provide power at a specified price. The next highest accepted offers after Coryton were Uniper’s Connah’s Quay power station in north Wales – which received £999 per MWh and Rocksavage Power Station in near Liverpool, also owned by InterGen, which received £750 per MWh. Rye House – owned by VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol – is understood to have bid £5,750 per MWh but its offer was not accepted. The profits of gas-fired peaking plants – so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform – have been in the spotlight over the winter. Their rates have jumped since the invasion of Ukraine, leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Despite increasing amounts of renewable electricity generation, Britain remains reliant on gas. Ofgem is expected to soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from receiving “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Peaking plant owners argue they provide a rapid source of electricity supplies, and only produce profits sporadically while detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. National Grid warned last October that Britain could suffer rolling blackouts this winter as Russian gas supplies were turned down after the war in Ukraine. However, mild weather and strong gas storage in Europe have eased those fears. The Grid expects to pay between £220m and £420m to keep five coal units on standby this winter. A spokesperson for InterGen said: “InterGen’s plants provide a crucial function in the energy system by keeping the lights on when demand is high and renewable generation is low. “This flexibility reduces the need for many power stations to run continuously, reducing the overall cost and carbon intensity of the grid.” National Grid and Uniper declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-19T07:45:33Z","webTitle":"‘We have money and power’: older Americans to blockade banks in climate protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","fields":{"bodyText":"Climate activists across the US will on Tuesday blockade branches of banks that finance fossil fuels, cutting up their credit cards in protest and holding rallies featuring everything from flash mobs to papier-mache orca whales. Unusually for such a spectacle, the protests won’t be led by young activists but those of a grayer hue. The protests, across more than 90 locations, including Washington DC, are billed as the first set of mass climate demonstrations by older Americans, who have until now been far less visible than younger activists, such as the school strike movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg. In a nod to the more seasoned age of participants, older people in painted rocking chairs will block the entrances to some of the US’s largest banks to highlight their funding of oil and gas extraction. “So far the kids have had to do all of the work and they’ve done an amazing job but it’s not fair to ask 18-year-olds to solve this problem,” said Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner who co-founded the Third Act group last year, which is designated for people aged over 60. The group has gathered momentum, attracting more than 50,000 members and recently holding a test-run protest in New York City, where participants marched under a banner reading “fossils against fossil fuels”. “Older people have got money and structural power coming out of our ears,” said McKibben, who is 62. “We have to show young people we have their back. I’m going to be dead before the climate crisis is at its absolute worst, but being nearer the exit than the entrance concentrates one’s mind to notions of legacy and we are the first generation to leave the world in a worse place than we found it. “I understand why people say ‘OK boomer’ – it’s not like we have done an amazing job in protecting the world.” While polling has shown that fears over global heating are most prevalent among younger people, to the extent that some question the wisdom of having children themselves, McKibben said he has found “huge concern” among older people about the climate emergency. “There is a sense people get more conservative as they age but I’m not sure if that’s true of this group of older people,” said McKibben, who pointed out that people in their 70s and 80s now were young people during the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. “The people sitting on rocking chairs on Tuesday were marching on the first Earth Day in 1970,” he said. “We probably all believed that the government would address these concerns – we may have gotten a little complacent.” McKibben said he hoped the protests would highlight the link between “cash in the bank and carbon in the air”. Third Act is encouraging people to sign a pledge to quit Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America if they don’t stop funding fossil fuels. The “big four” are the world’s leading banking financiers of oil and gas projects, despite variously committing to helping address the climate crisis, with a recent report finding they have collectively provided $1.1tn in financing to fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The protests, despite their months of planning, appear to be prescient, coming in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a leading funder of renewable energy projects, and a growing backlash against investor environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations by rightwing groups and leading Republicans, many themselves funded by fossil fuel interests. The previously bone-dry world of ESG, which is the effort to reduce investor risk to outside threats such as the climate crisis, has found itself thrust firmly into the US culture wars, with the governors of 18 Republican-led states, including the Florida governor and presumed presidential contender Ron DeSantis, last week jointly condemning the “proliferation of ESG throughout America” that is “putting investment decisions in the hands of the woke mob”. DeSantis has, without evidence, blamed the fall of Silicon Valley Bank on its diversity initiatives “and politics and all kinds of stuff”, leading a concerted Republican effort to paint financial institutions as being in thrall to progressive priorities in the form of ESG. Marlo Oaks, the Republican state treasurer of Utah, said last week that ESG was part of “Satan’s plan”. Joe Biden’s first presidential veto is expected to be over the issue of ESG, following a successful attempt by Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would have overturned an administration rule on sustainable investing. Biden’s rule had lifted a ban placed by Donald Trump upon money managers considering ESG and the climate crisis in investment decisions, such as assets that could be damaged by extreme weather, or become unviable in a decarbonized world. The furore over ESG has seen several Republican-led states draft legislation to ban consideration of the climate crisis in investments, despite the party’s previous support for free market economics. The attacks on ESG have been “politically motivated”, according to Amelia Miazad, a law professor and ESG market expert at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. “ESG is about risk management and generating sustainable value but its critics have made it about values, which is easy to attack,” she said. “The anti-ESG movement has just repeated a simple, inaccurate message over and over again. It’s quite remarkable market meddling by so-called free market advocates, telling investors and banks what they can and can’t invest in.” Miazad said that investors were now being “very careful” about mentioning ESG because it had become so politicized, instead favoring terms such as “sustainability”. “There has been a chilling of corporate speech because of this ESG backlash,” she said. “If they are worried about saying the C-word – climate – we are in a far worse place in terms of business norms, public discourse and democracy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T15:00:42Z","webTitle":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 230 residents in Stoke-on-Trent are to launch a class action lawsuit against the city council after they claim they were “mis-sold” 25-year solar power contracts which have left some with faulty panels and unexpected bills. Council house tenants in the city said they feel “lied to” after being signed up to the contracts without realising, and facing years of what they believe is poor quality customer service and installation. Community Energy Scheme (CES) was launched in 2018 by the city council in conjunction with Solarplicity Energy, which sent staff door to door to encourage residents to sign up to the solar panel scheme. It now has 4,800 customers in the city. Tenants signed up to contracts on the spot with a signature on an iPad, but many residents said they thought they were only agreeing to have their home assessed for its suitability for solar panel installation. Cassandra Burton, 50, has lived in her three-bedroom semi-detached council property for 15 years, and was alone at home when someone from CES came. “I thought it was for them to do a survey on the property, check the roof basically. I signed the iPad and that was it, I never heard anything else from them,” she said. “I had no idea I’d signed up to a 25-year contract until we read a story in the newspaper about them.” She later found out her digital signature had been copied on to three separate documents. “I’m autistic, I was by myself, I didn’t have my partner with me, I just thought it was a council thing. I feel like they took advantage,” said Burton, adding that her solar panels were never hooked up to her electricity supply but she still received bills. “It’s a constant stress. Every single day I’m on the CES community group on Facebook to check what’s happening, what the latest advice is. I won’t let anybody in my house now,” she said. “Who doesn’t want more renewable energy? Who doesn’t want to help the Earth be a better place? But it makes me really angry.” Bibby Thomas, 58, said she specifically asked the salesperson to explain what she was signing when he came to her door in 2019. “He gave me this iPad, and I said: ‘I’m dyslexic, so I can’t read the whole lot. I’m not signing anything that shouldn’t be signing, am I?’ He said no, everything was fine, so I did a squiggle on it.” She claims no one mentioned a 25-year contract. A number of residents are to launch a class action lawsuit against the council and CES over how the scheme was sold to them. In response to concern expressed by customers, CES said they were given the option to keep their existing contract, swap to an updated contract with more user-friendly language and terms, or exit the agreement and switch back to receiving all of their electricity from the grid. The company insists the fact the agreements were for 25 years was stated on the CES website, literature, contracts and by sales teams, and that all tenants received a letter from the council explaining the scheme before being signed up. It also said the majority of tenants received a verification call to check they had been given the information. The Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent city council gave Solarplicity Energy exclusive rights to install the panels on its housing stock, initially handing over the details of more than 1,000 homes it thought would be suitable, in return for £100 for each installation. Solar panels were also installed on empty council house properties, meaning prospective tenants had to sign up to the solar energy scheme as a condition of tenancy. The Stoke-on-Trent Labour councillor Desiree Elliott said the scheme had been “a failure and a scandal from the beginning”. She said: “The company involved has demonstrated time and again that it is not up to delivering a project of this size with any semblance of professionalism.” Residents said they were promised the solar panels would come with batteries, allowing them to store surplus solar energy to use in the evenings and on darker days, but these have only recently started being rolled out. CES said 200 tenant properties have had batteries installed since 2020. In 2019 Solarplicity Energy ceased trading after criticism from Ofgem and the Energy Ombudsman, who received 3,324 complaints about the company, and tenants have been switched to a different supplier, while still remaining part of the 25-year CES contracts. A Stoke-on-Trent city council spokesperson said the scheme was designed to support tenants “in lowering their energy bills and reducing carbon emissions”. “Supporting households to generate more sustainable, cheaper and greener energy is even more significant given the considerable rises in energy prices this winter. It is clearly not appropriate to comment any further on a matter that is subject to legal proceedings.” A spokesperson for CES said: “We have worked hard to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. We’ve listened to concerns raised about the accessibility of language used in our contracts, and we’ve offered tenants the opportunity to make their own choice about how the solar energy being generated on their home is used. “We remain committed to making access to solar as easy and beneficial as possible, and tenants are welcome to contact us if we can provide them with any support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/aukus-submarines-liberal-mp-rowan-ramsey-nuclear-waste-storage-site-south-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"Liberal MP says search for Aukus submarine nuclear waste dump site in his electorate is premature","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/aukus-submarines-liberal-mp-rowan-ramsey-nuclear-waste-storage-site-south-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/aukus-submarines-liberal-mp-rowan-ramsey-nuclear-waste-storage-site-south-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP who faces the prospect of a nuclear waste dump in his South Australian electorate, has said he is “amazed” the government will begin the search in just 12 months for a facility that won’t be required for decades. The comments come as green groups rally against a key component of the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition: that Australia is required to dispose of the waste generated by its Virginia-class submarines and the new SSN-Aukus submarine. On Tuesday the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, announced that Australia would need a new facility, remote from the population, to dispose of nuclear waste on defence land, whether current or future. “Now to be clear, the first of the naval reactors that we will be disposing of will not happen until the 2050s,” Marles told reporters in Canberra. “But within the year, we will announce a process by which this facility will be identified.” According to defence department documents, the department will work with the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency to undertake a review in 2023 to identify locations “that could be suitable to store and dispose of intermediate-level waste and high-level waste, including spent fuel”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ramsey, whose electorate of Grey covers 908,595 sq km – the majority of South Australia – said he was “amazed” given the 33-year life of the Virginia-class submarine that a waste facility is required as soon as the 2050s. Australia has struggled with the question of where to store its slowly accumulating intermediate nuclear waste for decades. The Morrison government chose a site near the town of Kimba, in Grey, but the local Barngarla people united against the plan. The Albanese government has continued to pursue using the Kimba site. Ramsey said there is “no way” the Kimba site “could, should or would be a repository for high level waste”. “You need 400 metres of solid, dry granite. There are no assessments like that around Kimba, it’s a completely different facility to the one proposed.” Ramsey said defence land near the remote village of Woomera, also in his electorate, “may well be suitable, but so may a lot of other sites” around Australia. “Geographically and geologically Woomera would be fine.” The Australian Conservation Foundation has raised the alarm about Australia housing nuclear waste, with its analyst Dave Sweeney pointing to its “scant real world experience”. “Successive federal governments have searched, without success, for a site for low and intermediate-level waste for more than three decades,” Sweeney said. “This waste remains poisonous and carcinogenic for tens of thousands of years. “Aukus presents by far the biggest threat yet that Australia will become a dumping ground for the world’s worst nuclear waste. “If defence applies its standard, highly secretive approach to the management of this high-level nuclear waste, hundreds of generations of Australians will live with the consequences.” On Tuesday the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, called for a “sensible, mature debate” about nuclear energy, waste and its disposal, urging critics to “grow up”. “We dispose of nuclear waste now in our country … we dispose of it safely,” Dutton told reporters in Canberra. “We’ve got … an incredibly stable environment to store nuclear waste.” Dutton said the Coalition “won’t be playing politics … we will support the government in its decision to deal with the waste”. Asked about housing others’ waste, Marles told ABC TV that managing the nuclear material and reactors powering Australian submarines “is an important part of Australia’s nuclear stewardship and that is all we’re focused on”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T11:48:39Z","webTitle":"Republicans criticize Biden’s Ukraine trip as Putin pulls out of nuclear arms treaty | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Fiona Hill, who was a Russian specialist at the White House national security council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”.

The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has said Moscow’s military chiefs are refusing to supply the group with munitions and are seeking to destroy it, accusing them of “treason”, in an escalation of the war of words between senior Russian officials and the private army boss. Biden unveils Trump-style plan to deter asylum seekers at Mexico border The US could bar tens of thousands of people arriving at the US-Mexico border from claiming asylum under a proposal announced yesterday, in what would be the most wide-ranging attempt yet by the Biden administration to deter unauthorized crossings. Under the new rules, the US would generally deny asylum to people who show up at the US southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through, mirroring an attempt by the Trump administration that never took effect because it was blocked in court. The measure, while stopping short of a total ban, imposes severe limitations on asylum for people of any nationality except Mexicans, who do not have to travel through a third country to reach the US. The proposed rule establishes “a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility” for anyone who passes through another country to reach the US border with Mexico without first seeking protection there, according to a notice in the Federal Register. Exceptions will be made for people with an “acute medical emergency”, “imminent and extreme threat” of violent crimes such as murder, rape or kidnapping, being a victim of human trafficking or “other extremely compelling circumstances”. Children traveling alone will also be exempt, according to the rule. What do campaigners plan to do? The measure is almost certain to face legal challenges; Donald Trump pursued a similar ban in 2019 but a federal appeals court prevented it from taking effect. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) vowed to fight the Biden rule in court, likening it to the Trump restriction, which was described as a “transit ban” by activists.

Stat of the day: 6,542 guns seized from people about to board planes at 262 airports in 2022 Two decades after 9/11, thousands of passengers who are otherwise conditioned to remove their shoes, bag their liquids and all too often surrender their dignity at security screenings somehow manage to forget they are carrying an object that is the very reason they are being searched in the first place. Last year, the US Transport Security Administration (TSA) seized 6,542 guns from people about to board planes at 262 airports – a sixfold increase since 2010. Almost nine in 10 of the weapons were loaded. While most people claimed to forget they even had a gun, others thought that because they had been issued a permit to carry a gun they could carry it anywhere, anytime, Jeffrey Price, an aviation security expert said. Don’t miss this: the sudden dawn of the de-influencer – can online superstars stop us shopping? Social media is now what markets and shopping centres once were – the place people go to spend their cash – full of “must-haves” such as heated eyelash curlers and “miracle” pink cleaning pastes. And when something goes viral online, it sells in real life. Influencers reportedly sold $3.6bnof goods in 2022, with the $700 Dyson Airwrap hair styler among the top sellers. But a backlash against overconsumption is spreading fast. If influencing is trying to convince people on social media to buy certain products, then de-influencing is, very broadly, the opposite. Is this the beginning of the end for our rampant, destructive consumer culture – or just influencing by another name? Climate check: Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending Georgia, a state once known for its peaches and peanuts, is rapidly becoming a crucible of clean energy technology in the US, leading a pack of Republican-led states enjoying a boom in renewables investment that has been accelerated by Biden’s climate agenda. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August, billions of dollars of clean energy investment has been announced for solar, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing in Georgia, pushing it to the forefront of a swath of southern states that are becoming a so-called battery belt in the economic transition away from fossil fuels. Republican-led states have claimed the lion’s share of renewable energy and electric vehicle activity, even though they did not vote for the climate spending. Last Thing: spy balloon, UFO or Dragon Ball? Japan baffled by iron sphere washed up on beach Police and residents in a Japanese coastal town have been left baffled by a large iron ball that has washed up on a local beach, with authorities admitting they have no idea what it is – only that it is not about to explode. The sphere, measuring about 1.5 metres in diameter, has been at the centre of fevered speculation since it washed up on Enshu Beach in the city of Hamamatsu on the country’s Pacific coast, according to local media reports. Fears that it could be a stray mine were dismissed after experts used X-ray technology to examine the object’s interior and found that it was hollow. Police began inspecting the ball, which is orangey-brown with what appear to be darker patches of rust, after a local woman spotted it metres from the shore, Asahi TV reported.

Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Maliar, went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured after the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres.

On Tuesday, America’s largest utility was set to go on trial in an effort to hold it accountable for sparking a wildfire that claimed the lives of four people. Family members of the victims of the 2020 Zogg fire planned to face PG&amp;E executives as the company stood trial in a northern California courtroom on manslaughter charges. Instead, Judge Daniel Flynn on Wednesday dismissed the charges and like it has done in so many cases before, PG&amp;E agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. The outcome largely marks the end of a chaotic chapter for the company, a behemoth in the energy industry that serves about one of every 20 Americans and nearly half of all Californians. In recent years, PG&amp;E has been defined by the devastating fires linked to its power equipment that have killed dozens across the state, resulting in mass payouts and the threat of criminal consequences, but arguably little reform. The utility did not have to admit wrongdoing as part of the Shasta county deal, a preferable outcome for PG&amp;E, said Steven Weissman, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and former judge at the California public utilities commission. “This has been the modus operandi for all these years to never have to face judgment or face as few judgments as you possibly can,” he said. “This really has been a very successful strategy.” As part of a settlement to avoid a trial, PG&amp;E has agreed to pay $45m to fire prevention and rebuilding efforts in the rural area and a $5m civil penalty, a significant sum in a small, under-resourced county. But no one seems particularly thrilled with the resolution, not family members of the deceased nor the district attorney, Stephanie Bridgett, who hoped to hold PG&amp;E accountable and force change. “This resolution does not make me happy,” said Bridgett, when announcing the settlement. “Taking PG&amp;E to trial and holding them criminally responsible was always our goal – but the tentative ruling changed our position and I am unwilling to gamble with the safety of Shasta county.” For survivors like Wayne King, whose 79-year-old wife, Karin, died as she tried to escape the flames, the settlement was a welcome but unsatisfying outcome. “All the money that PG&amp;E has, all the contributions – that won’t make up for my loss,” said King. ••• PG&amp;E, has faced years of reckoning over its role in California’s wildfire crisis. Between 2017 and 2022, the company set off at least 31 wildfires that wiped away entire towns, burned nearly 1.5m acres and 24,000 structures, and killed 113 people. The company has been accused of repeatedly prioritizing profits over safety, enriching shareholders rather than removing trees that pose a danger to its power lines. More radical efforts to reform PG&amp;E, either by splitting it into multiple companies or a takeover by the state government, have not materialized. PG&amp;E has paid billions of dollars to settle claims from fire victims and pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in the 2018 Camp fire – sparked when a crumbling piece of equipment, overdue for replacement by decades, cast sparks into the dry Sierra Nevada foothills, creating a fire that killed dozens of people, destroyed about 14,000 homes and leveled the town of Paradise. In the aftermath, it filed for bankruptcy, replaced its CEO several times over and pledged to run a safer company that can supply gas and electricity to millions of Californians without injuring or killing its customers. The company was still dealing with the fallout from the Camp fire when it sparked a new blaze in Shasta and Tehama counties that became known as the Zogg fire. The 2020 disaster started during a windstorm when an ailing gray pine, marked for removal because of its defects, fell on power lines in the rugged mountainous terrain east of Redding. Fueled by fire-friendly conditions, the blaze raced through the tiny towns of Igo and Ono and scattered homes in the foothills, consuming more than 56,000 acres (23,000 hectares), taking out hundreds of homes and forcing people to immediately evacuate. The fire quickly traveled the half mile to the home of animal rights activists Karin King and her husband, Wayne. By the time they got in their vehicles with their dogs, fire was burning on both sides of the only route to safety. Smoke made it so the road was hardly visible at all and Karin, who was driving separately, kept falling behind, Wayne King said in an interview with the Guardian. Wayne would stop and honk and wait for her to catch up and turned around to find her more than once, but as they wound down the last stretch of the winding two-lane road, he was alone. “Karin didn’t come,” he said. Later he’d learn she made it only half a mile past the last spot he saw her. “She ran off into a gully with the car and it burned up and she burned up and the dog burned up and all of our records and all that [was] in the fire resistant safe burned up,” he said. “She was a good woman and I miss her terribly.” Three other people died trying to escape the fire: Alaina Mcleod, 46, and her eight-year-old daughter, Feyla, and Kenneth Vossen, 52, who was badly burned as he sought refuge at a pond on his rural property and later died at a hospital. PG&amp;E was eventually fined $150m by California’s public utility regulator, which alleged that “the tree that caused the fire was not removed in time because of PG&amp;E’s poor recordkeeping”. Bridgett, the district attorney, opted to charge the company, putting an investigator and multiple attorneys on the case. She geared up for a fight against a corporation with substantial resources in order to get justice for the victims and to ensure that PG&amp;E doesn’t “continue the practices that led to the fire in the first place”. From the outset, she says, the imbalance was palpable. “They have a virtually unlimited budget when it comes to their defense,” she said. “They have multiple attorneys present at every court appearance. They have significant resources that a small county DA’s office doesn’t necessarily have.” Still, the case moved forward with a judge finding PG&amp;E should be criminally prosecuted for its role in the fire, and setting the date for a trial in June. The company challenged that ruling and another judge determined the tree falling on company infrastructure did not necessarily mean PG&amp;E had been negligent, a ruling that led to the charges being dropped and the settlement reached. Under the agreement, PG&amp;E will fund fuel mitigation efforts, a scholarship program to increase the number of local firefighters, a large animal evacuation center and memorials to honor those killed in the fire. PG&amp;E must also move some of its infrastructure underground, install new weather monitoring stations and meet regularly with the district attorney’s office to ensure it is complying. “The agreement reflects our continuing commitment to making it right and making it safe. We stand behind our thousands of trained and experienced coworkers and contractors working every day to keep Californians safe,” Patti Poppe, the company’s CEO, said in a statement. Bridgett wanted to see the case go to court, with all the evidence against PG&amp;E made public, but said she’s hopeful about what the agreement means for the county. “We worked hard with them to try to come up with very measurable things they could do and we could have oversight with them. Ultimately, we want them to be in compliance with the law and so that none of their equipment is going to start a fire that kills another person.” ••• Last month at the Igo store, a one-stop shop and bar, residents shared memories of the blaze and how it forever altered life in the tiny woodsy settlements tucked in the foothills, now green and blooming with wildflowers after recent rains. “It was terrifying – plain and simple. We’d lived through a lot of fires up here but never seen anything like that,” said Damon Brazell, 82, a retired sheriff’s deputy who lost his home in the disaster. “It took out the heart of the community. There’s nothing here anymore.” Brazell ruminated over all the fire took as he sat at the bar surrounded by some of his remaining neighbors. Many people didn’t rebuild their homes, he said, and key community gathering places were destroyed. He lost treasured belongings and a property he built. He has a new home, but not one he made with his hands. “It broke my spirit. It gave me a big case of the blues – a sadness I don’t think I’ll get over,” he said. But Brazell, like others at the Igo store, were torn about what would constitute a proper punishment. “How do you hold a corporation accountable? I think it’s kind of fruitless myself.” The money promised in the settlement will help ensure the area’s safety in future fires, King said. The home he shared with Karin survived the fire and he still lives there. He runs into PG&amp;E workers, in the area to remove dead trees, as he goes about his errands – trips to the Igo store for lunch, church and the nearby cemetery where he visits Karin. “I get irritated every month when I get a PG&amp;E bill, but I pay it,” he said. Still, he says, revenge is the last thing he wants. “We were married for 62 years and we had a very good relationship all of our 62 years. I miss her but getting even with PG&amp;E is not in my book,” he said. “Hopefully, they have come to the conclusion they need to do a better job of protecting their lines.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-06T05:51:05Z","webTitle":"US senators urge Joe Biden not to sell ‘scarce’ nuclear submarines to Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"Two top US senators have urged president Joe Biden not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, warning it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. The intervention confirms the US is under pressure not to sell its submarines before Australia is able to build its own as part of the Aukus alliance – meaning it could be decades before Australia gains nuclear submarines. A spokesperson for the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, played down the leak, saying “the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is taking shape, and an announcement remains on track to be made in the first part of this year.” The Australian government is due to announce whether it plans to buy nuclear submarines from the US or UK by March. According to US news site Breaking Defense, the Democratic senator Jack Reed, chair of the US Senate armed services committee, and the then ranking Republican senator James Inhofe, now retired, sent Biden the letter in December. Reed and Inhofe wrote that “over the past year, we have grown more concerned about the state of the US submarine industrial base as well as its ability to support the desired Aukus SSN [nuclear submarine] end state.” “We believe current conditions require a sober assessment of the facts to avoid stressing the US submarine industrial base to the breaking point,” they reportedly wrote. “We are concerned that what was initially touted as a ‘do no harm’ opportunity to support Australia and the United Kingdom and build long-term competitive advantages for the US and its Pacific Allies, may be turning into a zero-sum game for scarce, highly advanced US [Virginia-class submarines].” “We urge you to adopt a ‘do no harm’ approach to Aukus negotiations and ensure that sovereign US national security capabilities will not be diminished as we work to build this strategic partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom over the coming decades.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US aims to build its own fleet of at least 60 nuclear-powered submarines but is struggling to meet its own needs. In December the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, recommitted the Biden administration “to ensuring that Australia acquires this capability [nuclear submarines] at the earliest possible date”. But the two senators reportedly noted “just 1.2 Virginia-class [nuclear submarines] have been delivered, on average, per year over the past five years”. Selling or transferring Virginia-class submarines prior to meeting the US navy’s requirements would make it “less capable of meeting sovereign wartime and peacetime requirements”, they wrote. “Make no mistake, we recognise the strategic value of having one of our closest allies operating a world-class nuclear navy could provide in managing long-term competition with an increasingly militaristic China. “However, such a goal will take decades to achieve, and we cannot simply ignore contemporary realities in the meantime.” Marles’s spokesperson said Aukus would “significantly transform Australia’s strategic posture and the work undertaken over the last 16 months speaks to a shared mission between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States”. Australia was “grateful” for the US and UK enabling Australia to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine capability and “that important capability is not lost on us”, the spokesperson said. In September 2021, Australia tore up a $90bn conventional submarine contract with France to instead acquire nuclear submarine technology from the US or the UK as part of the new Aukus alliance. The deal created a looming capability gap, requiring the Collins-class submarines to be upgraded and their life extended until the first nuclear-propelled submarines could be made in Australia by the late 2030s. In June, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader and former defence minister, revealed he “believed it possible to negotiate with the Americans to acquire, say, the first two submarines off the production line out of Connecticut”. “This wouldn’t mean waiting until 2038 for the first submarine to be built here in Australia,” he wrote. “We would have our first two subs this decade. I had formed a judgment the Americans would have facilitated exactly that.” The revelation prompted criticism from experts including Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said this had not been agreed by the US government and it would be a “pretty serious kind of breach or leak [to disclose it]” if it had. “No boats are available before 2030 unless the US gives up its own – that would be quite remarkable – the US has been clear there is no way they can build additional submarines,” Hellyer told Guardian Australia at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Mind the capability gap: what happens if Collins class submarines retire before nuclear boats are ready?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","fields":{"bodyText":"“Every galah in the pet shop is talking about a capability gap”, former defence secretary Dennis Richardson memorably said. Those “galahs” include defence experts, policymakers and industry, who are all fretting about whether Australia will be left vulnerable when the ageing Collins class submarines are retired. The federal government is considering the defence strategic review and advice from the submarine taskforce on acquiring a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, but there are concerns that they will not be in service in time for a seamless handover from the Collins class. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has been sounding increasingly positive that there will be no such gap. “I’m feeling confident about our ability to deal with this,” he told Guardian Australia in January, adding it would be part of “the optimal pathway” to be announced soon. Marles said the government had asked the taskforce to examine “to the extent any capability gap arose how we would meet the capability gap”. “The process has been very focused on that, and I’m confident I’ll have answers to it.” While much of the focus is on submarines, though, experts say a multi-pronged approach could work. Acquiring that fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines is the first “pillar” of the Aukus partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, but the second pillar, which includes hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence and underwater drones, will be needed in the short term. It will be at least a decade before even the first submarine is delivered and some estimates even push the timeline out to 2050. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to meet with both the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in the US in March, to announce the governments’ plans. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Marles has emphasised the “genuinely trilateral” nature of the Aukus agreement between the three countries, leading to speculation a new hybrid submarine to replace the ageing Colins class fleet will be built using elements of both the US and the UK’s boats. The life of the Collins fleet will be stretched out as much as possible with life-of-type extensions, but the boats are still set to be retired by the end of the next decade. Marles told the ABC late last year that the Labor government had “inherited” a situation where the first submarine would not be in the water until the 2040s. “We need to be looking at how we can get that sooner,” he said. When former prime minister Scott Morrison announced he was scrapping the deal with France to build 12 boats in favour of the Aukus deal to build “at least” eight submarines in South Australia in 2021, he also announced plans to acquire various missiles, including hypersonic and precision strike guided missiles over the next decade. On top of the missiles, there is a second pillar of Aukus that includes working with the UK and the UK on underwater drones, quantum technology, artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, advanced cyber capabilities, electronic warfare, and other innovations. Those technologies are expected to help Australia in the context of increasing aggression from China while it waits for the submarines. Earlier this year, US senators warned Biden not to sell Australia any submarines, arguing the US did not have the industrial capability to spare any, which dashed hopes of getting any of those submarines earlier. Foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, Tom Corben, said that “wouldn’t be news” to policymakers in the US or Australia. “When congressmen or senior leaders in the US say the shipbuilding base is maxed out, they’re not lying,” he said. “It’s been like that for a number of years now.” He said Marles had made it clear the project would be trilateral, which suggests Australia will not rely on the US and that instead the work would be split between nations. Corben said there could be “really creative solutions” found, but that it was important to remember the submarines are only one part of Aukus. “They’re pillar one of two pillars,” he said. While submarines are the “backbone” of the maritime force structure, Corben said he wouldn’t be surprised if the imminent announcement also contained more details on the second pillar. “Marles has emphasised that Australia is particularly interested in any capability through pillar two that would arrive in the next five years,” he said. “We’re in a bit of a dangerous window of time in terms of our collective ability to resist Chinese military incursion. The submarines won’t really help in that window, they’re more of a long-term [proposition]. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more detail on the other elements that are going to be required.” In a statement last year, the White House said the Aukus partners had made “strong progress” on the advanced capabilities. Trials of autonomous vehicles are set to begin this year, it said, and trials of quantum technologies for position, navigation and timing, would happen over the next three years. Work had already started on autonomous and artificial intelligence-enabled systems to improve the speed and precision of decision-making processes, while the three countries were also strengthening their defences against cyber-attacks, sharing information on electronic warfare, developing advanced hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, said there were other capabilities Australia could buy that could do “similar things” to submarines – such as sinking ships. “One area we’re already getting into is mine warfare,” he said. “But we’re also investing in anti-ship missiles that can be fired from the air and we’re even getting some land-based missile capability.” Other options that have been floated include building entirely new air warfare destroyers equipped with more than 100 missile launching cells, in order to bolster firepower, or building an interim conventional submarine. But Roggeveen warned that China’s anti-ship ballistic missiles made surface ships vulnerable. And Marles has appeared to dismiss the idea of interim submarines. “There are no plans for any conventional – conventionally powered interim submarine capability, as we move towards gaining the nuclear-powered submarine capability,” he said in January. In a statement to parliament on 9 Febuary, Marles emphasised the importance of the second pillar. “These capabilities will help us hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk, at a greater distance and increase the cost of aggression against Australia and its interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/mar/25/tim-dowling-the-power-is-off-no-doubt-the-fault-of-the-electricians-apprentice","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-25T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: the power is off – no doubt the fault of the electrician’s apprentice ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/25/tim-dowling-the-power-is-off-no-doubt-the-fault-of-the-electricians-apprentice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/25/tim-dowling-the-power-is-off-no-doubt-the-fault-of-the-electricians-apprentice","fields":{"bodyText":"I wake to hear my wife saying something about a power cut. “Where?” I say. “The radio just went off,” she says. “And there are no lights on anywhere.” I join her at the window. “They’ve got their hall light on,” I say, pointing to a house behind ours. “It’s probably just us.” It is just us. The circuit breakers have all tripped. I climb on a chair and flip them back one by one, trying to isolate the problem. “I’m gonna check my office,” I say. “If the electricity goes off, alert me.” I slip boots over my bare feet and run through the rain to my office shed. Looking back toward the kitchen, I see my wife and the middle one staring at me through the windows. I reach over and flip on a light switch. Nothing happens, but the kitchen darkens. My wife and the middle one raise their arms above their heads and wave them like signalmen. “I guess I’m working inside today,” I say, once power is restored downstairs. “Do I need to call Kitch?” my wife says, meaning the electrician. I turn on the coffee machine. All the lights go off. “Yes,” I say. I run a long extension lead from the sitting room so I can make coffee. Upstairs, I can hear my wife talking to Kitch. “You’ve got to come today,” she says. “I can’t have him working in the house.” I’ll get no work done if Kitch comes, I think, because he will require me for an apprentice. I put a slice of bread in the toaster. All the lights go off. Kitch turns up at about 2pm, tool bag in hand. “Have you isolated the source, like I taught you?” he says. “Kitchen sockets,” I say. “Which includes my office.” “That’s good,” he says. “Make me a coffee.” I show him where the wire for my office emerges from the house through a hole drilled through the brick. “Amateurs,” he says. “Full disclosure,” I say. “I rewired that garden light myself a couple of months ago.” “It won’t have anything to do with that,” he says. “Good,” I say. “The inside of it was so complicated I had to post a picture online and ask for help.” “You didn’t think to call your electrician?” he says. “I thought you’d be busy,” I say. “I’m always available,” he says, “to educate.” He tests the kitchen sockets one by one, treating me, as usual, as if I have an important electrician’s exam coming up. “Any others?” he says. “The ones for the washing machine? And the dryer?” He nods. “Good,” he says. “Show me.” The washer and tumble dryer are in a cupboard just off the kitchen, stacked on shelves one above the other. “Why are they raised up?” he says. “I don’t know. It was always like that,” I say, “but the tortoise lives under there in the winter, so …” Kitch reaches beneath the washing machine and pulls out a cobwebbed box full of brushes. “Been looking for your shoeshine kit?” he says. “Yes,” I say. “For six years.” He shines his torch on the pipe behind, which is shrouded in a delicate nimbus of black mould. “That’s overflowed,” he says. “The socket is damp.” “So my troubles are compounded,” I say. “Beyond all measure.” “Don’t panic, Tim,” he says. Kitch changes the socket for a new one, and tells me to put a bowl under the pipe to catch any leaks until he can bring someone round to look at it. “How much do I owe you?” I say. “Let’s see how things progress before we get into that,” he says. If he won’t let me pay him, I think, it means my apprenticeship has only just begun. Next morning I go out early, but as soon as I get home in the evening I go to check the pipe behind the washing machine. Then I immediately go and find my wife. “Has Kitch been here?” I say. “No,” she says. “Then who left the washing machine face down on the floor?” I lead her back to the cupboard. “Huh,” she says. “It must have shaken itself off its platform.” “Why would it do that?” I say. “Because I put a big duvet in it,” she says. I look at the machine, lying there in a puddle like a depressed robot, and I think: beyond all measure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/25/yachts-at-the-top-power-privacy-and-privilege-in-the-world-of-australian-superyachts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-24T22:33:04Z","webTitle":"‘Yachts at the top’: power, privacy and privilege in the world of Australian superyachts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/25/yachts-at-the-top-power-privacy-and-privilege-in-the-world-of-australian-superyachts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/25/yachts-at-the-top-power-privacy-and-privilege-in-the-world-of-australian-superyachts","fields":{"bodyText":"Visible from the footpath at the water’s edge, the superyachts berthed at Melbourne City Marina bob gently up and down, their sleek and shiny exteriors reflecting the placid waters below. For me, and most people on this planet, this is about as close as we are likely to get to a superyacht. In Australia, that’s a pleasurecraft longer than 24 metres. Internationally, the starting length is 30 metres. The City of Melbourne recently spent $1.97m upgrading Victoria Harbour, including its four superyacht berths, to fit vessels up to 67 metres long. But for the tiny portion of the world’s ultra wealthy for whom superyacht size is a matter of concern, 67 metres is fairly moderate. The longest privately owned superyacht in the world is the 180-metre Azzam, reportedly built for the former president of the United Arab Emirates, the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Superyachts are markers of power and extravagance. They are floating, transportable six-star hotels, capable of including everything from nail parlours to gyms, helipads and boardrooms, marble bathrooms and priceless art, as well as what the industry calls “toys” – from jet skis worth the equivalent of the average Australian worker’s salary to private submarines worth millions. In a recent memoir, the longtime Australian seafarer and superyacht captain Brendan O’Shannassy writes: “Until space travel becomes a commercial reality, [superyachts] are the greatest display of wealth on the planet.” For all their capacity to allow long-distance travel in extreme luxury, though, superyachts aren’t frequent visitors to Australian waters. The local industry has been lobbying to change that, and state and federal governments have made superyacht-friendly moves, hitching millions of dollars in public infrastructure upgrades and tax concessions to claims that these will bring millions in economic benefits to every port in which a vessel makes anchor. But despite public money going towards establishing and upgrading infrastructure that is only accessible to the very privileged few, there’s been little public scrutiny of this elite industry. *** Superyachts are not super common, although their numbers are growing. Sales company Edmiston recently estimated that the global fleet comprised a total of 5,892 vessels – representing an increase of 44% over the last decade. Most of those yachts are between 30 and 50 metres (4,957); 13% are between 50 and 80 metres (753) and 3% are over 80 metres (182). There are only about 120 superyachts owned by Australians, concentrated mostly around Sydney Harbour and south-east Queensland. About half of them are charter vessels. It’s likely all of them have, at some point, been through Captain Richard Morris’s hands. Fresh off the plane from the Dubai Boat Show, Morris tells Guardian Australia that he got his start in the merchant navy at 17, before landing a job as a deckhand two years later on the 86-metre superyacht Nabila, owned by the influential and extravagant Saudi arms dealer, fixer and liaison of presidents and tycoons Adnan Khashoggi. Nabila was Khashoggi’s third yacht and the height of ostentatious luxury when it launched in 1980. Its 100 rooms included Italian hand-carved onyx bathrooms, a patisserie, a movie theatre, a hair salon, a hospital with an operating theatre, and 320 metres of Italian leather upholstery. When Khashoggi’s empire began to decay in the late 80s, he sold Nabila to Donald Trump for $29m – considered a bargain – with the businessman who would later become US president renaming the yacht the Trump Princess. Morris, meanwhile, left Nabila after a year and began building his own career as a seafarer, becoming a captain at just 27 and a master mariner. He moved ashore in 1999 and was hired by NSW Maritime to build a new superyacht marina in Rozelle Bay. “That was the beginning of superyachting in Australia,” Morris says. “Prior to that, only a few people here had superyachts, because there was the tall poppy syndrome – high net wealth Australians were reluctant to show their extreme wealth.” The Sydney Olympics in 2000 changed that, Morris says. The marina development was partly to accommodate the super wealthy who were planning to bring their yachts down for the Games. Morris managed the marina for the next decade, before moving into local superyacht sales and charters. The Sydney experience is one that the industry is keen to replicate for the forthcoming Brisbane Olympics. The mining magnate Gina Rinehart may have been lampooned by the public in 2021 when she complained that she had nowhere to moor her yacht in Brisbane, but the Queensland Labor government appears to agree it should invest in more superyacht infrastructure. It’s had a multiyear superyacht strategy since 2018, and in May last year it was updated and extended to take the Olympics into account. Its listed achievements so far include $28m to upgrade the Cairns Marine Precinct, $2.87m for a 160-metre superyacht berth on the Gold Coast, and planning for 80-metre superyacht facilities and additional marinas in new developments on the Spit. Its stated goal is for Queensland to be “world recognised as the major superyacht hub in the Asia-Pacific region”. Economic modelling for industry lobby group Superyacht Australia argues the 2032 Games presents “an unparalleled opportunity to springboard the sector on to the global stage and demonstrate the prosperity the sector can support in Australia”. It hopes Australia will reach 8% of the global market – that’s 533 vessels – in the next three years, which it says will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in direct economic benefits. Until just prior to the pandemic, superyachts could not come to Australia without the owner paying a hefty tax on the vessel, with the visiting multimillion-dollar vessels treated as though they were being imported permanently into the country. That changed with the passage of the Special Recreational Vessels Act 2019. The act, which relieves the owner of having to pay import duties including GST, was hitched as a rider to various unrelated bills by the Coalition government until it was passed as a standalone just before Christmas in 2019. The legislation allows foreign vessels to be chartered while in Australian waters, with GST payable only on the charter itself. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The then member for the Queensland seat of Dawson, George Christensen, claimed it as a pet project. “I have been very, very pushy in getting this legislation to come forward,” Christensen said at the time. Christensen claimed the bill was “just about ensuring that local communities can get some of the coin that these people drop”. Labor passed the bill with minor amendments. Since then, six superyachts have applied for a temporary licence, with just four making the trip. ‘It’s your world’ The industry estimates that the local market for superyacht charter or purchase is 1% of the population. It sees it as a subset of the cruise market, which is estimated to capture about 5% of Australians. It’s hard to ignore the symbolism of that figure, the 1%. Morris’s anecdotes help to illustrate just how that plays out in practice. In 2011, the manager of U2 called him, he recalls, hoping to find a suitable superyacht for the band who were dissatisfied with the crowds at the Park Hyatt. (He was unable to find one that met the band’s specific desires.) That same year, Morris put up the actor Kevin Spacey in the 37-metre Tango during Spacey’s run as Richard III in Sam Mendes’s production that toured Sydney’s Lyric theatre. “Dinner was at 1am and [Spacey’s] guests would leave at 4am. Then the yacht would move to Rose Bay and he’d sleep till midday, and then come back and do it all again,” Morris says. “It’s an option for these very high-profile people. They’re anchored in the middle of the harbour. The level of security and discretion that a superyacht provides is much better than any hotel. They can control their world. And that’s the essence of yachting – it’s your world.” When Covid lockdowns hit, owners of superyachts raced to their vessels, escaping up to the Great Barrier Reef instead of staying at home, Morris says. The associated freedom saw a boom in superyacht sales in 2021. Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, however, superyachts have also become associated with sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Not without reason: they represented 30% of the global market. Documents recently revealed, for example, that the former Chelsea FC boss Roman Abramovich owned 16 superyachts, a full eight of which were support vessels for the 162.5-metre A$649.5m Eclipse he’d had built in 2010. Morris says there were Russians who had planned to come to Australia prior to the war – one of whom was going to contract him to manage his yacht. It would have put millions through his business. The sanctions, though, have “put the fear of God through the industry”, he says. “If I was managing a Russian yacht I would have gotten rid of it. It’s so lucrative, though, that a lot of people didn’t. I’m glad that the Russian client didn’t come. Sure, I missed out on huge revenue, but that’s not the point.” *** The 2032 Olympics aren’t the local industry’s only goal. Another is to bring more vessels to Australia to make use of the shipyards – mainly in Queensland and Western Australia – for maintenance, retrofitting and building. Another still is to increase the number of Australians joining the superyacht workforce. On Facebook groups like Superyacht Crew, keen industry up-and-comers post pictures of themselves – snorkelling, in uniform, sipping a glass of wine in a party dress – alongside their formal qualifications and experience. The semi-casual CV comes with added notes about the seafarer’s personality, including whether or not they have tattoos (being tattoo-free appears to be a selling point). Employment standards, however, can vary. Commercially registered yachts available for charter, which usually have permanent captain and crew despite the rotating guest list, are bound by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, which lays out minimum standards of employment, including legally enforceable contracts, maximum working hours per week, shore leave and annual leave entitlements, and the right to return to your country of residence for free. Enforcement of those standards is the responsibility of the country under whose flag the ship sails, and yachts chartering out of Australia need to be registered here. Private yachts are a different story. They are not automatically covered by the Maritime Labour Convention, and employment contracts are often managed by owners’ personal office staff. Non-disclosure agreements are common, and rumours abound that upsetting the wrong people on board can see you unceremoniously dumped at the nearest port. Superyacht crew in Australia are not covered by any union-based collective bargaining agreements. The Maritime Union of Australia national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, tells Guardian Australia that the MUA doesn’t have a real presence among the superyacht labour force, but alleges exploitation and harassment are rife. Morris vehemently rejects this, saying the working conditions on superyachts are “exceptional”, better than cruising or commercial shipping, higher paid, and far exceeding the minimums set by the Maritime Labour Convention. Guardian Australia was unable to speak to any junior superyacht crew directly, despite attempts, but a survey of 402 superyacht crew members conducted by the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network in 2018 described them as mainly well paid. More than 90% of survey respondents – male and female – said they felt safe on board, though 53% of female crew said they had experienced discrimination, harassment or bullying from owners, other crew or guests, compared with 30% of men, who most commonly experienced it from captains or other senior crew. The level of work-related stress was high, particularly among women. No matter who ultimately owns them, private yachts are likely to be flying what the industry calls a “flag of convenience”, which can make standards harder to enforce, as the boat can spend very little, if any, time in its country of registration. Flags of convenience are a common maritime business practice, though, including in cruising and freight. And the results can be ironic: a cursory registry search of some high-profile private superyachts reveals, for example, that the mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s 58.2-metre Pangaea Ocean Explorer – which will shortly carry out environmental surveys on the DNA of ocean life, assisted by $3m in federal funding to Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation – sails under the Jamaican flag. Clive Palmer’s 56-metre $40m yacht, despite being patriotically named Australia, is registered in Malta. Control, chameleons and seasick fish What is it that draws the ultra rich to yachting? “Control,” says David Good, the chief executive of industry peak body Superyachts Australia. “You can control the itinerary, who is on board and what food is going to be served. During the pandemic, when you were on board was probably the only time you could fully take control of who was going to be with you and your family. Covid was probably one of the best things that ever happened to boating in general.” Sam Sorgiovanni concurs. He’s used to catering to the whims of wealth: a sought-after designer based in Western Australia with about 35 years of experience, Sorgiovanni estimates he’s designed at least 20 superyachts. The biggest challenges usually relate to balancing functionality with the budget constraints of the commissioner. But some design requests are more complicated. For the Nirvana, Sorgiovanni says his company designed two onboard terrariums for chameleons, water dragons, turtles and frogs, and a separate cricket facility to breed the reptiles’ food. The terrarium included curtains to shield the animals from the disco lights of an adjacent salon. On Anastasia and Barbara – owned by the same Russian billionaire as Nirvana – the designers were asked to include fish tanks. Unfortunately, they later discovered, fish kept in a tank on a boat die – from seasickness. The origin of most of the super wealth that fuels superyacht ownership is natural resources, Sorgiovanni says. But criticism of the industry, he says, echoing Morris, is “tall poppy syndrome”. “Yachting is the greatest redistribution of wealth around. Although it is for the privileged few, if you take a 100-metre yacht, there’s 50 crew on board, they’re all being paid, they’ve all got families, and wherever that yacht goes, especially if we’re allowing them to come into charter, as soon as it pulls into port … it would be millions generated every time the vessel comes in,” he says. “It’s a pyramid. We’ve got the yachts at the top, and a pyramid of suppliers underneath it.” *** Saltwater and air is hard on boats, and superyachts require a lot of money for upkeep, and a lot of maintenance. So when an owner abandons ship, the vessels suddenly become very large and very unwieldy public burdens. In February, the government of Antigua and Barbuda claimed and put up for auction the 82-metre Alfa Nero, which it said had been abandoned in Falmouth Harbour since early last year. The owner is rumoured to be the Russian oligarch Andrey Guryev; Guryev has denied owning the yacht, according to other reports. That same month, the 29-metre superyacht Nakoa broke free of its moorings in Honolua Bay in north-west Maui, Hawaii, and drifted before running hard aground in shallow water, peppered by rocks and reef. The US Coast Guard seized jurisdiction of the yacht after its owner, the charter mogul Jim Jones, informed authorities that he would not organise or pay for the boat’s salvage. Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a series of statements that Jones would instead receive a bill of at least US$460,000 for the salvage effort, and may face further penalties and possible legal action. Facing widespread criticism, Jones told Honolulu media that he was “taking responsibility” for the matter. “We’ve been talking to the DLNR to let them know we’re not leaving them with the bill,” Jones said. “We’re not running.” Timely and safe salvage was important to the local community but also to the environment. The grounding occurred just outside a significant marine conservation zone, and the yacht struck and damaged at least 30 corals and live rocks, its hull leaking diesel into the reef. Footage of the wreck circulated on social media, where commenters raged about the fuel seeping into the pristine water and the damage to the reef. It took contractors three salvage attempts over nearly two weeks to dislodge the 122-tonne Nakoa. On 5 March, three tugboats managed to drag it back into the water. As they set off to tow the yacht to Honolulu, a pod of humpback whales surfaced and escorted the boats out of the bay, away from the marine sanctuary. The Nakoa never made it back to dock. Halfway to Honolulu, the yacht began listing heavily. Unable to be dragged any further, it was scuttled in the deep channel between the islands of Maui and Molokai, and left to sink to the ocean floor. The whales swam on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/30/aukus-expensive-and-not-easy-to-replicate-australian-officials-told-foreign-diplomats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-29T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Aukus ‘expensive’ and not ‘easy to replicate’, Australian officials told foreign diplomats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/30/aukus-expensive-and-not-easy-to-replicate-australian-officials-told-foreign-diplomats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/30/aukus-expensive-and-not-easy-to-replicate-australian-officials-told-foreign-diplomats","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian officials have told foreign diplomats that the Aukus submarine plan is “expensive” and not “easy to replicate”, as part of an effort to play down concerns about the risks of other countries racing to do the same, a newly released tranche of documents reveals. Officials also urged diplomats to be on guard for disinformation about the nuclear-powered submarine plan, the documents show. Briefing notes obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws lay bare the arguments the government is using to defend and explain Aukus to foreign diplomats posted to Canberra. At briefings held in the capital city in the days after the Aukus announcement in March, Australian officials reiterated that the submarines would not be armed with nuclear weapons. They said the acquisition was “a sensible response to changing strategic circumstances, and would serve as a deterrent and contribution to regional equilibrium”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia was “genuinely committed to transparency in its pursuit of this endeavour” whereas “others in our region were engaging in a much more rapid scale-up of military capabilities without transparency” – an apparent reference to China. The documents show 62 embassies or high commissions sent representatives to briefings held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) where they were able to ask questions about the plan. “Disinformation was also a key focus of our advocacy, with speakers encouraging those in attendance to engage with counterparts here and with Australian representatives in capitals to ensure the accuracy of information they were receiving,” said an internal note circulated within Dfat. The document did not specify examples of such disinformation, but the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has previously said some of China’s public statements about Aukus are “not grounded in fact”. China’s mission to the UN said in March that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard” – the US and the UK – “are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. The new documents show that many of the answers given by Australian officials at the Aukus briefings aimed to reassure countries about nuclear non-proliferation issues. The first assistant secretary of Dfat’s Aukus taskforce, Sarah deZoeten, told those in attendance that Australia would retain control of operational waste and spent fuel. “Spent fuel would not have a chemical composition that could be turned into nuclear weapons without additional chemical processing, which would require facilities that Australia did not have and would not seek,” she said, according to the official notes. Australia’s ambassador for arms control and counter-proliferation, Ian Biggs, said the government was working with the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Any attempt to build those facilities would be very obvious to the IAEA.” Aukus is novel because it will be the first time a provision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime has been used to transfer naval nuclear propulsion technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the documents show Biggs rejected concerns there could be a “breakout” of a nuclear weapons capability. “Regarding proliferation concerns, Biggs noted that Australia’s acquisition of NPS [nuclear-powered submarines] would be difficult and expensive; it would not constitute a ‘breakout’ because this was not a process that would be easy to replicate,” the documents say. “Australia was committed to setting the highest possible non-proliferation and safety standards, which other states bearing legitimate ambitions to acquire NPS would similarly have to meet,” Biggs was recorded as saying. Biggs argued these standards “would apply to all states in the region, such that if replicated by others, their acquisition of NPS would not present a non-proliferation concern to us”. Guardian Australia has previously revealed that a Chinese embassy official asked Australian officials at one of the briefings whether the Aukus submarines were intended for “sightseeing”. The documents released by Dfat did not include the wording of the questions asked by foreign diplomats at the events, on the grounds that disclosing those details could harm international relations. But the answers addressed similar themes. In one case, deZoeten replied that “these would be military assets, not civilian – but unlike the NPS being used by others in the region, Australia’s NPS would not carry nuclear weapons”. Australia plans to buy between three and five Virginia class submarines from the US in the 2030s, before the Adelaide-built “SSN Aukus” – based on a British design – enters into service from the 2040s. At the briefings, Australian officials said US Congress would need to approve the Virginia class purchase, but the government was “heartened” by the level of bipartisan support. “Australia would continue to engage with the US on the matter of new versus re-used Virginia class submarines, but in all scenarios these boats would have the highest standards of quality and safety,” deZoeten said. Australia is expected to buy a mix of new and used Virginia class submarines. Officials said the submarines would be “under Australia’s complete sovereign control”, an issue that has been a topic of considerable pushback from former prime ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull. US and UK nationals may join Australian crew on board the new submarines but such a presence would not be a “prerequisite” for operating them, the officials said. Biggs said Australia’s crews “would have no reason to access the reactor cores” but there would still need to be “maintenance of the reactors throughout the NPS lifecycle … so crew members needed nuclear qualifications to understand what they would be looking after”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T07:30:14Z","webTitle":"Awe by Dacher Keltner review – the transformative power of wonder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","fields":{"bodyText":"I find it hard to think of a word that is as unmoored from its root as “awesome”. It comes from the early Middle English age, meaning dread, or terror, but these fail to capture awe’s particular blend of fear, reverence and submission. It is often found in religious contexts (Milton wrote of “aw” in Paradise Regained), but crops up in politics too (Hobbes viewed awe as a valuable tool for an all-powerful state, or “Leviathan”). Since the time of those writers there have been ongoing attempts to claim the emotion; the most reviewed book about awe on Amazon is by a Philadelphia-based pastor, who laments: “All too often, we stand in awe of everything but God.” The author of those words should probably stay clear of Dacher Keltner’s new book. Like a dogged species collector, Keltner pursues awe wherever it may be found: in historical and literary sources, scientific papers, the lives of his interviewees and his own experiences. Yet the book is far more than a field guide. Keltner, a bestselling author and psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is on a personal mission to reveal the secrets of the good life. “Twenty years into teaching happiness,” he writes, “I have an answer: FIND AWE.” Keltner studied under the psychologist Paul Ekman, a pioneer in the study of emotion who documented facial expressions in different cultures (Ekman argues that certain expressions of emotion are universal, a view that has been challenged by other psychologists). Like Ekman, Keltner is now in high demand as an emotion expert; he has collaborated with Pixar on its film Inside Out and now heads Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, which offers advice on everything from parenting to political polarisation. Early on in his book Keltner defines awe as “the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world”. There is a lot to unpack in this definition: our experience of awe is bound up with cultural notions of scale, our place in the cosmos, and context (whether we find a mountain awe-inspiring or simply terrifying may depend on the local risk of avalanche). Keltner tells us that the experience of awe varies among different cultures, but it is a universal emotion, one accompanied by its own language of chills, tears and “vocal bursts”, like “oohs” or “whoas”. He acknowledges that awe has a dark history, but insists that today it has largely been shorn of fear, citing one study that suggests it sits closer to emotions like joy and admiration. For Keltner, awe is an ennobling experience, one that can foster wonder, creativity and collaboration. He understood this in 2019 when he lost his brother, Rolf, to colon cancer, and he writes movingly about the transformative feelings that followed. “The boundaries that separated me from the outside world faded,” he writes. “I felt surrounded by something vast and warm. My mind was open, curious, aware, wondering.” In his quest to make sense of awe, and convince us of its virtues, Keltner embarks on a journey to find the emotion in a wide range of sources, from mystical texts to conversations with artists. In doing so he shows that the stimuli for awe are remarkably varied, dividing them into eight categories (or “wonders”), including “moral beauty” and “collective effervescence”. Awe often defies language, but Keltner is highly attuned to its traces. Detective-like, he observes his interviewees’ facial expressions and gestures. “When I play, I feel the vibration in my heart,” the cellist Yumi Kendall tells him. “It is beyond language. Beyond thought. Beyond religion. It is like a cashmere blanket of sound.” In one chapter, Keltner describes his visit to San Quentin state prison in San Francisco where he asks prisoners about their experiences of awe. It’s a crucial part of his book that seeks to anticipate an oft-made criticism of the self-help genre: that the author’s proposed remedy, if it works at all, can only be taken up by those familiar with cashmere blankets. Keltner finds that prisoners, facing unfathomably difficult circumstances, do indeed experience awe, whether when reading the Qur’an or singing in a church band. “Awe,” he writes, “is almost always nearby, and is a pathway to healing and growing in the face of the losses and traumas that are part of life.” If anything, he says, those who have wealth or status may find it harder to access. It is no easy task to reconcile scientific research with the messiness and ambiguity of the stories that we tell about ourselves and our emotions. The sciences and the humanities are sometimes compared to an estranged couple, and Keltner nobly seeks to address both parties, discussing the vagus nerve and Saint Francis of Assisi in the same breath. Yet the two can never quite converse in this book. Presented in rapid succession, Keltner’s stories and cultural references can seem mere instruments to buttress his taxonomic system; rarely does he stay with his characters and explore how awe has played out in their lives. As an author he wears many hats: there is Keltner the scientist, carefully explaining what we know about human emotion; Keltner the ethnographer, quizzing prisoners and artists about awe; Keltner the spiritual guide, exhorting us to embrace an emotion which leads to an ennobling sense of smallness; and Keltner the status-conscious public intellectual, dropping into Pixar’s offices or having dinner with the Spielbergs. It makes for an interesting, if disorientating, reading experience, and one that speaks to our own age, where the secular now holds ground previously occupied by religion. His case is often convincing, and yet as a lay reader this text left me with more questions than answers. Is awe always the pathway to happiness? Anyone who dips into the troubled history of the 20th century will learn that fascism was adept at harnessing the power of awe, whether through monumental architecture or mass rallies. Keltner briefly writes about a veteran of the Iraq war, but he doesn’t pause to unpack the meaning of the US military strategy which, in part, took the name of his subject: “shock and awe”. “Awe” here is not ennobling, but an instrument of domination, as those on its receiving end well understood (some Arab writers translated “awe” in this phrase as tarwī˛ : terror). All this suggests, at the very least, that the meaning of this elusive emotion may not be as far from its fearful origins in Middle English as we suppose. That if one can write a book extolling awe, citing Gaudí, Romanticism and Nelson Mandela, there is another one to be written which draws on the work of fascist architect Marcello Piacentini, the Rajneeshpuram cult and the nuclear bomb. That to call an emotion good or bad depends a great deal on our assumptions about human nature and history. • Awe: The Transformative Power of Everyday Wonder by Dacher Keltner is published by Penguin (£16.99).

Bernie Fraser, who was tasked with guiding Australia’s monetary policy through 18% interest rates and “the recession we had to have”, said the unemployment payment was one of the “many areas desperately needing attention” in the coming budget. His voice joins the chorus of people – including Labor backbenchers – to publicly demand the government do more to raise the jobseeker rate, which has condemned recipients to poverty. The government is also facing an internal battle, with MPs demanding the cabinet react to the increasingly loud calls. Fraser said it was the duty of the government to act in the best interests of its people and during this time of record low unemployment, it had a chance to change some people’s lives for the better. “I am supportive of an increase in the jobseeker allowance – it is not only necessary but timely,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “By providing extra support, it might help enable people to get a good-paying job to change their circumstances.” The government’s own expert panel recommended an urgent increase to jobseeker and associated welfare payments, arguing the rate as it was had become a barrier to finding work. Labor MP Peter Khalil on Wednesday night became the latest Labor MP to publicly pressure his own government to raise the rate. He tweeted that he had joined a growing list of colleagues in signing an open letter from the Australian Council of Social Services calling for a jobseeker increase. “My comments supporting raising jobseeker are on the record. I’ve advocated on this issue publicly &amp; internally with colleagues since elected in 2016,” Khalil wrote. “It’s the fair &amp; right thing to do so people can live in dignity.” The former Treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry agreed, writing in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia that it was time to raise the rate. “People who are unable to secure employment within a short period of time, in a labour market this tight, clearly need special help,” he wrote. “Equally clearly, they are not getting what they need. Denying them such help, while insisting that they should have to survive on $50 a day for more than 12 months, is simply cruel.” Fraser said it was a “difficult job to fit in all the worthy things” needed in the budget and there were some difficult decisions for the government to make. But he said there was also a clear choice. “They have got a bit of power. They should be using it for the people.” The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has not committed to raising the rate, although he has said there will be cost of living relief in the budget with a focus on helping the most vulnerable. Chalmers said the focus was helping people into work, given Australia’s tight labour market. But advocates argue that ignores the realities for the long-term unemployed, who are more likely to be older, low-skilled, experiencing chronic health difficulties or have a disability. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the budget was yet to be finalised and the expenditure review committee had one more meeting before signing off on the economic plan, which will be handed down on 9 May. But both Chalmers and Albanese, as well as the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, are facing increasing pressure from the caucus to act, with many backbenchers nervous about the electorate’s reaction to a Labor government not living up to expectations. “The Greens are really nipping at our heels on this and housing and if we don’t come up with the solutions people expect from us, then we may not get a second chance,” one MP said. “I don’t think there would be many Labor MPs who are not worried about the impact for people trying to live on welfare. There’s a public campaign, but there is also a lot happening privately to try and push this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T08:06:53Z","webTitle":"‘Visceral and powerful’: the everlasting appeal of giant art panoramas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","fields":{"bodyText":"“So much of the panorama experience is visceral and powerful, being transported in front of these massive works of art,” enthused James Fishburne, co-curator of Forest Lawn’s new exhibition Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas. Fishburne spoke with me about this little-known but spectacular art form, taking me behind the scenes of the exhibition he co-curated in conjunction with the Velaslavasay Panorama. Grand Views offers audiences a rare chance to immerse themselves in the fascinating world of panoramas. The show centers around Forest Lawn’s Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection – which has displayed two enormous panoramas for decades – and it also offers other enormous works, like the Panorama of the Valley of the Smokes, made by artist Sara Velas in 2000. In addition, the show provides a rich assortment of broadsides, rare objects and ephemera from the 19th-century world of panoramas that help audiences truly get inside the creation and exhibition of these massive pieces. Curating the show, Fishburne worked alongside panorama artist Sara Velas and writer Ruby Carlson, both of whom co-curate the Velaslavasay Panorama – a museum dedicated to panoramas located in nearby Los Angeles. According to Velas, her love of panoramas goes back to her early childhood, and getting to show her work in this exhibit alongside ephemera from panorama history is something of a full-circle moment. “I knew I wanted to make things since I was a child, and being in St Louis I learned about the 19th-century panorama tradition. I went on this huge pilgrimage to Europe when I graduated college to try and visit as many of the panoramas as I could from this era. Remarkably, a lot of the artifacts and things we’re displaying in this exhibit are tied to things that I saw in that self-assigned pilgrimage.” Carlson, who has served as secretary-general of the International Panorama Council and who writes on numerous subjects, including panoramas, realized she wanted to dedicate herself to panoramas during a chance visit to the Velaslavasay Panorama, where she had a transformative encounter with the massive Effulgence of the North. “Me and my friends were the only people there at the time, and we spent a good hour in the panorama itself,” she told me. “It was just an incredible atmosphere, unlike anything I’d ever been to before and spending that time with a couple of my favorite people just made it very magical. I spent a lot of time at the Velaslavasay Panorama that day, and as we were leaving, I thought to myself, ‘I want to be here more.’” With Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas, Fishburne, Velas and Carlson hope to help others understand just how wonderful this largescale artform is, while communicating the long and rich history behind it. Due to the Covid-19 lockdowns, the curators had more time than expected to piece the exhibition together, letting them trace the rich web of connections between panoramas and much of Los Angeles history. “The fun part was the early stage, thinking about the connections we want to make,” said Fishburne. “There’s been so many incredible threads that we’ve been able to combine, since we got to let the whole thing marinate for an extra year-and-a-half during the pandemic. I think it really helped to enrich it.” One of those threads is the history of Los Angeles film-making, which is woven into the history of panoramas in California. Grand Views exhibits a Hollywood backdrop, as well as numerous cinematic artefacts, letting audiences see how these huge artworks have contributed to the development and evolution of film. The exhibition also offers a sketch for a panorama made by Disney imagineer Herbert Ryman, who is celebrated as being the first artist to ever visualize Walt Disney’s aspiration to create a theme park. “It’s really fascinating that between Disney, Hollywood, Forest Lawn, etc there’s this sort of cross-pollination among these worlds. And the final product is different for each of them, but they’re all sort of these very powerful, immersive, moving experiences. For Grand Views, we took slices of panorama history that are also interwoven with LA history.” A major piece shown in Grand Views is the monumental crucifixion panorama painted by Polish artist Jan Styka – at 195ft by 45ft, it is one of the largest paintings ever created. Simply titled Crucifixion, the work’s immense size and impressive detail give it a dramatic, cinematic air, heightened by the immense hall that Forest Lawn created to house it and the dramatic show it uses to present the work to viewers. According to Fishburne, “Crucifixion is one of the only four surviving crucifixion panoramas in the world.” He went on to detail how, in contrast to the other three, which are exhibited in a circular format, Forest Lawn’s hall draws from LA inspiration. “You step into this building, which uses ecclesiastical architecture, but then it also uses very Los Angeles–inspired architecture. The panorama’s theater space is essentially a movie palace. It’s a panorama presented in the way of a cinematic format.” Grand Views offers substantial context on the making of Crucifixion, as well as offering windows into the other three major crucifixion panoramas, all currently in Europe. “Through Sara and Ruby’s contacts with the International Panorama Council, we were able to get artefacts and ephemera from the three others,” said Fishburne. “You get a really rich sense of the history surrounding these works. It’s the behind the scenes look at how these incredible artworks were created and presented.” In a world where digital experiences are more and more becoming the norm, and where artistic innovations of the 19th century may seem as antiquated as the Pony Express in a world of text messaging, Grand Views offers viewers the chance to challenge their expectations and experience something both old and new. “What I really like about panoramas is that it frames the experience of going to see a painting more theatrically,” said Velas. “I think in particular it’s feeling very special right now because we’re spending so much time in this digital space.” Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas is on show at Forest Lawn, California, until 10 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T23:41:06Z","webTitle":"Microsoft to power Bing with AI as race with Google heats up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","fields":{"bodyText":"Microsoft is revamping its search products with more artificial intelligence, using technology behind the wildly popular ChatGPT, as tech companies race to take advantage of increasingly powerful AI tools. The company detailed its plans at a special event on Tuesday, saying it would work with OpenAI, the startup behind the ChatGPT tool, to upgrade its Bing search engine and Edge web browser and enhance the information available. The announcement comes a day after Google revealed it is releasing its own artificial intelligence chatbot, called Bard, in response to the huge success of ChatGPT. Microsoft is staking its future on AI through billions of dollars of investment and seeking to capitalize on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology, and is already changing how people gather information. “This technology is going to reshape pretty much every software category,” said Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, in a briefing for reporters at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The move is meant to rival Google and potentially claim vast returns from tools that speed up all manner of content creation, automating tasks if not jobs themselves. Shares of Microsoft rose 3.2% in afternoon US trading to $265.10 a share. The power of so-called generative AI that can create virtually any text or image dawned on the public last year with the release of ChatGPT. Its human-like responses to any prompt have given people new ways to think about the possibilities of marketing, writing term papers or disseminating news, or even how to query information online. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer, said at the briefing that the Bing search engine would be powered by AI and run on a new, next-generation “large language model” that is more powerful than ChatGPT. A chatbot will help users refine queries more easily, give more relevant, up-to-date results and even make shopping easier. Mehdi said a public preview of the new Bing launched on Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks. Everyone can try a limited number of queries, he said. As an example of how it works, Mehdi asked the new Bing to compare the most influential Mexican painters and it provided typical search results, but also, on the right side of the page, compiled a fact box summarizing details about Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and José Clemente Orozco. In another example, he quizzed it on 1990s-era rap, showing its ability to distinguish between the song Jump by Kris Kross and Jump Around by House of Pain. And he used it to show how it could plan a vacation or help with shopping. The strengthening partnership with the ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been years in the making, starting with a $1bn investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the development of a powerful supercomputer specifically built to train the San Francisco startup’s AI models. Microsoft is now aiming to market OpenAI’s technology, including ChatGPT, to its cloud customers and add the same power to its suite of products. Google has taken note. On Monday it unveiled Bard, and the company is planning to release AI for its search engine that can synthesize material when no simple answer exists online. Microsoft’s decision to update its Edge browser will intensify competition with Google’s Chrome browser. The rivalry in search is now among the industry’s biggest, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “Microsoft is looking to win this AI battle,” he said in a research note on Monday. The shift to making search engines more conversational – able to confidently answer questions rather than offering links to other websites – could change the advertising-fueled search business, but also poses risks if the AI systems don’t get their facts right. Their opaqueness also makes it hard to source back to the original human-made images and texts they have, in effect, memorized, though the new Bing includes annotations that link to sources. “Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,” is a message that appears at the bottom of the preview version of Bing’s new homepage. “Make sure to check the facts.” By making it a destination for ChatGPT-like conversations, Microsoft could invite more users to give Bing a try, though the new version so far is limited to desktops and does not yet have an interface for smartphones – where most people now access the internet. On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. Appearing at Microsoft’s event, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said the “the new Bing experience looks fantastic” and is based in part on lessons from its GPT line of large language models. He said a key reason for his startup’s Microsoft partnership was to help get OpenAI technology “into the hands of millions of people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:00:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian plans for nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘dangerous and irresponsible’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"bodyText":"It is now 8pm in Kyiv, and that concludes today’s Ukraine war live blog. Thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s events: Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to its neighbor Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday, according to AFP. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured following the explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, which law enforcement has attributed to a Ukrainian drone. “A Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV was the cause of an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk, Tula region,” the Tass news agency quoted a law enforcement agency source as saying, according to Reuters. “The drone was packed with explosives.” None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies.

In a Sunday tweet, Borrell said: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security.” “Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice,” he added. “The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” On Saturday, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement reached with Belarus will see Moscow stationing tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbors’ territory. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. More details are emerging about the reported explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, where two people suffered shrapnel wounds. The crater was caused by a drone, the Tass news agency quoted law enforcement as saying, Reuters reports. Three residential buildings were also damaged following the explosion, a regional security agency said. More reaction from Kyiv on plans by Russian president Vladimir Putin to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. The ministry said: Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation. It demanded a UN security council session and called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it accepts the Russian weapons. The Ukrainian statement added: Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons. Two people have suffered shrapnel wounds following an explosion on Sunday in the town of Kireyevsk, about 220km (140 miles) south of Moscow, the Tass news agency cited emergency services as saying. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but it left a crater in the centre of the town, in the Tula region, Reuters reports. “The explosion sounded at 1519 (1219 GMT). Two victims, born in 2002 and 2006, have shrapnel wounds. Emergency services are on the scene,” Tass quoted a local emergency services representative as saying. “There is a crater. This explosion was in the heart of the city,” the representative added. The representative said the injuries were not life-threatening and that investigators were working at the site. Several nearby buildings were damaged but no one was injured after a naval mine detonated after hitting some some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured.

We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. A Nato spokesperson said on Sunday: Nato is vigilant, and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments, most recently suspending its participation in the New START Treaty. The Associated Press reports on a new recruitment campaign launched across Russia seeking volunteers to enlist troops for the war in Ukraine. Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed. A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits. A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations. The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old. But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him. “It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.” Former Russian state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the Ukraine war, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia. Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” At the time, she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for ignoring protest laws. She continued protesting against the war after quitting her job at Channel One. Last August, she was charged with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and placed under house arrest in Moscow, where she was to await trial. She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter. Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life. She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level. Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds. When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said: I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia. Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained: A lot of factors came together. Over a long time I realised that the Russian TV became like a gigantic brainwashing machine. Secondly, I have Ukrainian roots – my father is from Ukraine. It was like this huge emotional outburst. But I didn’t really care what would happen to me later.” Ovsyannikova had worked at the channel for nearly 20 years and admitted she had in the past “shut my eyes to it [the propaganda]”, but the war became “a point of no return”. She said: This propaganda is made on a very high level …These people who are working in the main media channels, they don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me, and also, you can say that people who are pro-Putin, who are convinced in him, as no more than 10 or 20%. The arrest warrant handed to President Putin by the international criminal court could herald change, she added: I think this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite and they might plot against him. At least this is some kind of hope for me. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak has accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. On Saturday, Putin announced Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus “without violating our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation”, Agence France-Presse reports. But Podolyak said on Twitter: Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics … Second. He once again states his involvement in the crime. Violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty … Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research. Thomson Reuters has conducted the research, which has found that Ukrainian refugees may be victims of both traffickers on the ground and cyber-voyeurs. Researchers identified an increased interest in Ukrainian pornography since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 by analysing global internet search engine traffic. They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity. The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe. The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January. While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion. Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers. Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it. “We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.” The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period. Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms. You can read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Here’s some more on football. Later on Sunday, Ukraine take on England at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition. UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley. Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home. Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford. His father is in Kyiv. Discussing the match, he told PA News: I hope it will be amazing, because it’s like new fresh air to our community to watch our guys fighting to get to the Euros. We hope this game our guys will show what we can do. And also it will be good present for our military, because they are every day fighting for our freedom. I hope they will watch this game and this game will will make them happy. The Azadi Stadium in Tehran can hold up to 78,000 at capacity. As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv Moscow kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise. There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for Russia from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw. Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace. Russian money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties. On Sunday evening, Ukraine’s footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war. Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it. Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy. The bottom line is, forget Russia.” Read the full report here. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast on Sunday, stating that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. Putin also said western powers were building a new “axis”, bearing some resemblance to Germany and Japan’s second world war alliance. Interfax quoted Putin as saying: We are not creating any military alliance with China. Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret. Kyiv on Sunday said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, wrote on Twitter, adding that the move was “a step towards the internal destabilisation of the country”. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023 Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. The head of the National Bank of Ukraine said that it had “created huge risks for macro-financial stability” when the bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia to plug a budget shortfall, adding that an “open conflict” with the government over the issue had been resolved. “It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,” Pyshnyi told the newspaper. Reactions continue on Vladimir Putin’s announcement Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. “It’s a very significant move,” Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told Reuters. “Russia had always been very proud that it had no nuclear weapons outside its territory. So, now, yes, they are changing that and it’s a big change.” Putin did not specify when the weapons would be transferred to Belarus, which has borders with three Nato members – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. He said Russia would complete the construction of a storage facility there by 1 July. “This is part of Putin’s game to try to intimidate Nato … because there is no military utility from doing this in Belarus as Russia has so many of these weapons and forces inside Russia,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement on an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The US – the world’s other nuclear superpower – has reacted cautiously to Russia’s deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. A senior US administration official says there are no signs Moscow plans to use its nuclear weapons. Putin likened his plans to the US stationing its weapons in Europe and said that Russia would not be transferring control to Belarus. But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country. Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits. “Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy. Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. “We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.” In other key developments shortly after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/24/australia-defence-strategic-review-missile-production-corvette-warships-adf-australian-military-news","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T02:15:29Z","webTitle":"Defence strategic review: Australia will build longer range military power amid ‘radically different’ security environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/australia-defence-strategic-review-missile-production-corvette-warships-adf-australian-military-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/24/australia-defence-strategic-review-missile-production-corvette-warships-adf-australian-military-news","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia will seek to project military power further from its shores after a review warned the Australian defence force was structured for “a bygone era” and the security environment was “radically different”. The defence strategic review, released on Monday, called for the ADF to develop the ability to precisely strike targets at longer range and develop a stronger network of bases, ports and barracks across northern Australia. The Australian army will gain the ability to strike targets more than 500km away, up from the current 40km range. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia would become “more self reliant, more prepared and more secure in the years ahead”. When asked about a possible future conflict over Taiwan, Albanese said there was no shift in Australia’s position opposing any unilateral changes to the status quo. “We call for peaceful resolution through dialogue,” he said. The public version of the final report did not label China a direct military threat to Australia, but said China’s assertion of sovereignty over the contested South China Sea “threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests”. It labelled the competition between China and the United States “the defining feature of our region and our time”. The Albanese government has opened the door to potential changes to the number of Hunter class frigates and offshore patrol vessels to be bought by Australia, with a snap review of the navy’s surface fleet to report back later this year. The government also said it would consider options to increase stocks of guided weapons and explosive ordnance, including the rapid establishment of domestic manufacturing. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government estimated the cost of implementing the review would be about $19bn over the initial four-year budget period. But it said this initial amount was fully funded, through a combination of existing budget allocations and $7.8bn in new savings within the defence portfolio. In the longer term, the government is likely to have to find more funding to deliver its promise to increase defence spending. The defence strategic review, billed by the Albanese government as the most significant update of defence planning in nearly 40 years, was carried out by former defence chief Angus Houston and former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. The review called for a renewed focus on “how we manage and seek to avoid the highest level of strategic risk we now face as a nation: the prospect of major conflict in the region that directly threatens our national interest”. Announcing its response to the review, the government declared that the ADF must be equipped to “hold an adversary at risk further from our shores”. Five-point mission for the ADF The government has outlined a five-point mission for the ADF to suit the current times. In addition to defending Australia and the immediate region, the ADF will be required to “deter through denial any adversary’s attempt to project power against Australia through our northern approaches”. The more expansive tasks for the ADF are: to protect Australia’s economic connections to the world, contribute with partners to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific, and contribute with partners to maintain the global rules-based order. In a new “national defence statement”, the government said these aims were grounded in the view that the defence of Australia “lies in the collective security of the Indo-Pacific”. “As most of these objectives lie well beyond our borders, the ADF must have the capacity to engage in impactful projection across the full spectrum of proportionate response,” the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said in the statement. The government says it will prioritise developing the ADF’s ability to precisely strike targets at longer range and to manufacture munitions in Australia. The government said the ADF must also boost its capacity to “rapidly translate disruptive new technologies” into its own capabilities. The government argues the decisions – together with the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus agreement – will ensure Australia can project power in an “impactful” way across the Indo-Pacific region. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, said: “At the end of this process, we’ll go from an Australian army where the maximum range of its weapons is 40km to being able to fire missiles initially over a range of 300km, and with the acquisition of the precision strike missile, ranges in excess of 500km. “This is about giving the Australian army the firepower and mobility it needs into the future to face whatever it needs to face.” China-US competition the ‘defining feature of our region’ Smith and Houston’s full report remains classified but the government prepared a public version of the report. This report said that in the late stages of the cold war, Australia faced no direct military threat. “Australia’s strategic circumstances and the risks we face are now radically different,” the report said. “No longer is our alliance partner, the United States, the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific. Intense China-United States competition is the defining feature of our region and our time. Major power competition in our region has the potential to threaten our interests, including the potential for conflict.” The report said the nature of conflict and threats had also changed. “China’s military buildup is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the second world war. This has occurred alongside significant economic development, benefiting many countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Australia. This buildup is occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China’s strategic intent.” The report said in addition to developments in the South China Sea, China was also engaged in strategic competition in Australia’s near neighbourhood. The report said there was currently “only a remote possibility of any power contemplating an invasion of our continent” but added “the threat of the use of military force or coercion against Australia does not require invasion”. “The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare, crystallised by the proliferation of long-range precision strike weapons, has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits, the comfort of distance and our qualitative regional capability edge.” Decision on submarine base location deferred The government will hold off making a decision on the location of a new east coast base for nuclear-powered submarines, after the Morrison government shortlisted Brisbane, Port Kembla and Newcastle. While the Morrison government had planned to make a decision during this term of parliament, the Albanese government said it would make a decision on a location for the facility “late in this decade”. It is understood the reason for the delay is to focus, in the first instance, on upgrading HMAS Stirling in Western Australia for the rotational visits of US and UK submarines from 2027 in the first stage of the Aukus plan. The review also underlined the importance of diplomacy. It called for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to be given the resources it needs to “lead a whole-of-government statecraft effort in the Indo-Pacific”. The report warns that climate change is increasing the demand on the ADF for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief talks at home and abroad. The government will accelerate and expand numerous projects, including a land-based anti-ship missile system and new landing craft for the army. But the government has slashed the army’s plan to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles, which had been expected to cost up to $27bn, as a replacement for Australia’s Vietnam war-era armoured personnel carriers. The review recommended reducing this number to just 129 vehicles, enough for one mechanised battalion, in a move likely to cause consternation within the army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/05/activists-to-protest-at-coronation-despite-stiffer-police-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T15:00:39Z","webTitle":"Activists to protest at coronation despite stiffer police powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/activists-to-protest-at-coronation-despite-stiffer-police-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/05/activists-to-protest-at-coronation-despite-stiffer-police-powers","fields":{"bodyText":"Anti-monarchist campaigners have vowed to press ahead with plans to protest peacefully against the coronation of King Charles III on Saturday, despite what they have characterised as intimidatory tactics by the police and the government. The activist group Republic plans to hold a demonstration a short walk from where the king is due to be crowned. They have said they received letters from the Home Office warning them about new powers handed to police to deal with public demonstrations, while Scotland Yard has said its tolerance of protest will be low on the day. “Republic will not be deterred and we will be protesting on Trafalgar Square and along the route of the coronation procession on Saturday,” said the group’s chief executive, Graham Smith. “It is telling that Charles, who has had no problem speaking up on various issues, has chosen not to defend democratic rights when they are being threatened in his name. Perhaps he might make it clear that he believes in the right to protest.” The group said it received communication from the Home Office’s police powers unit that new powers had been brought forward to prevent “disruption at major sporting and cultural events”. Under those powers, blocking roads, airports and railways could bring prison sentences of 12 months, while people locking on to others, objects or buildings could go to prison for six months and face an unlimited fine. Police have also been empowered to stop and search people if they suspect they are setting out to cause disruption by protesting. “We have had two meetings with the Met police, and numerous phone conversations. They have repeatedly said they have no concerns about Republic’s plans. It is a mystery why the Home Office thought it was necessary to send us an anonymous letter that could be interpreted as intimidation,” Smith said. Referring to planned protests in general – not Republic’s demonstration specifically – the Met has said: “Our tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low. We will deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining this celebration.” His group plans to meet on Saturday morning to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square. Organisers intend to hand out placards and are encouraging attenders to wear yellow. They are also setting up smaller teams who will stage protests along the procession route. Asked about its plans for the day, the climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil said: “While everyone is focused on a billionaire in a shiny hat, the government is signing off on plans to destroy the lives of millions of ordinary people, while enacting laws to ensure that no one can stop them. “They are closing all avenues for dissent and restricting our legitimate rights to protest. But we will not die quietly. We will continue to do whatever is nonviolently possible to end new oil and gas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/22/what-is-the-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty-and-what-are-the-risks-if-russia-vladimir-putin-suspends-it","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T02:03:25Z","webTitle":"What is the New Start nuclear treaty and what are the risks of Russia suspending it?

Those decisions were taken in order to “maintain a sufficient degree of predictability and stability in the nuclear missile sphere”, the ministry said in a statement. What is New Start? Signed by then US president Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2010, the New Start treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy. Together, the US and Russia own 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. In this context, “deploy” means ready for immediate use, rather than have in storage. Weapons kept in storage are “non-deployed”. According to an explainer of the treaty written by the EU parliament, “Warheads count as deployed if loaded onto a missile that is itself deployed”. Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are committed to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers. Each side can conduct up to 18 inspections of strategic nuclear weapons sites every year to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years after Joe Biden took office. Inspections under the agreement were put on hold in March 2020 because of the Covid pandemic. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections were due to take place in November last year in Egypt, but Russia postponed them. Neither side has set a new date. What are the implications of a suspension? While the foreign ministry has said it would continue abiding by the treaty’s restrictions, a suspension of the treaty may mean that it will be harder for the US to monitor compliance. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts say it would be a serious blow if Putin went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments. John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the move is “entirely symbolic”. He believes that Putin made the announcement to pressure Biden into approaching Russia about ending the war, “so Russia can dictate the terms under which that would happen”. Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the weapons of mass destruction and other strategic weapons programme at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, told the Guardian the suspension was, “a big deal; suspension of the treaty is not equal to withdrawal but in reality, it could become really close over time”. He said that now, “Russia will probably stick to the New Start treaty limits,” but that it will “be harder for the US to verify compliance only using the national technical means. And I would expect the US also suspending its obligations. “One silver lining is that Russian decision is political and can be easily reversed if the overall political relations change,” he added. “Also, since the treaty exists, getting back to implementation would be straightforward. The problem, of course, is that there is no change of political relations in sight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T02:52:02Z","webTitle":"Russia blocks UN nuclear treaty agreement over Zaporizhzhia clause","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia has blocked an agreement at the United Nations that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) because Moscow objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine. The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russian refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine’s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its “protectors”, calling the negotiations a “one-sided game”. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. The NPT was a deal struck in 1968 in which nuclear weapons states pledged to disarm while states without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them. At the time there were five acknowledged nuclear powers, though Israel had secretly developed a weapon of its own by then. There are now nine states which possess nuclear warheads. Before the NPT came into force, some had predicted there would be dozens countries with their own arsenals. It is the second five-yearly review conference that has failed to issue a joint statement recommitting to the goals of the treaty. It has been 12 years since there was even partial agreement. But Sarah Bidgood, the director of the Eurasia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, said the NPT was not irreparably broken, and that every other country would have accepted the text. “The bigger takeaway for me is just how far-reaching the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine has become,” she said. “Even at some of the darkest moments of the cold war, cooperation in support of the NPT was often possible. But what we saw at the final plenary today does not bode well for the future of nuclear diplomacy, including on issues like arms control.” Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the disarmament elements in the proposed text had already been diluted by all five of the official nuclear powers recognised by the treaty – Russia, the US, France, the UK and China. “So, in all honesty, I don’t think it makes much difference,” she said. “This is the very dangerous game the nuclear weapon states are playing by consistently failing to achieve anything in this treaty. At some point, non nuclear weapon states are really going to start questioning whether or not this treaty is worth the effort, and if it’s relevant.” Fihn argued that the continued failure of NPT review conferences to find common ground meant it was all the more important for countries to join the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which seeks to ban them outright. It came into force in January 2021, and so far 66 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. “It’s going to be really relevant that we quickly move forward with the TPNW and get more states,” Fihn said. “It’s really an insurance that if [the NPT] continues to fail, that we don’t stand without anything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Power review – Toni Collette rules in this sparky sci-fi about superpowered women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","fields":{"bodyText":"Naomi Alderman’s 2016 bestseller The Power is an absolute banger. If you haven’t read it, do. It’s a great piece of counterfactual sci-fi teeming with characters and questions, and as full of ideas as action as it asks: “What would happen if women ruled the world?” Now it has been adapted by Raelle Tucker, Sarah Quintrell and Alderman herself into a 10-part series for Prime Video. All over the world, teenage girls and young women start developing the power to create electricity within themselves. Sparks fly from their fingertips and suddenly a new world of possibilities opens up. Their power shifts the balance of society. Now women can defend themselves. Now they can fight on equal physical terms with men. We follow a global array of characters. In the US we meet Allie (Halle Bush), who kills her rapist foster father and then, guided by an internal voice, embarks on a spiritual quest during which she is given sanctuary with a group of rebel nuns, from where she gathers the ambition to remake religion. We also meet Margot (Toni Collette), the mayor of Seattle, who must deal with the personal and political ramifications of the phenomenon as her angst-ridden daughter Jos (Auli’i Cravalho) develops her power and the world begins to wake up to the potential revolution ahead of it. In the UK there is Roxy (Ria Zmitrowicz), the neglected daughter of a London gangster (Eddie Marsan), who has always been passed over in favour of his sons despite being twice as capable even before she started exploding trucks and electrocuting things with a single touch. She wants a seat at the table – and after her mother is murdered by thugs, revenge. Tatiana (Zrinka Cvitešić) is the wife of a brutal eastern European dictator who soon looks to harness not just her own power but that of the other women, as the spread of the ability starts to transform her nation. Finally there is Nigerian journalist Tunde (Toheeb Jimoh), who exploits a female colleague’s early awareness of the phenomenon, gets offered a job with CNN and goes travelling round the world as the new order’s most ardent chronicler. In the book, this large cast is masterfully assembled and controlled by Alderman. There is time and detail enough to let the reader invest in each one. It doesn’t work quite so well on screen, where it feels like we are hopping endlessly about but, given that we don’t get to grips with what is going on until the third episode, moving ponderously slowly towards each revelation at the same time. If there was a flaw in the book it was that – to use a literary term – things went to shit too quickly. Although we are undoubtedly too wise and/or jaded now to believe in the kinds of women-led utopias depicted in such feminist classics as Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland or Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time, The Power felt as though it skipped too quickly over the possibilities for difference, let alone betterment, and slid straight into a repeat of all the problems we have now, just sex-swapped. The series only covers about a third of the book and would therefore seem to offer time to explore alternatives, even if ultimately they end the same way (electrical power corrupting as inevitably as any other, and all that). So far, however, the adaptation seems to be following the original’s path, which feels like a missed opportunity. The final two episodes were not available for review but let us assume they pave the way for a second series and hope that more can take place there. I see no reason why hunger for at least a fictional world in which women are gaining rather than losing power would have abated by then. • The Power is on Prime Video now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-24T18:29:44Z","webTitle":"Nasa to test nuclear rockets that could fly astronauts to Mars in record time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","fields":{"bodyText":"Nasa has unveiled plans to test nuclear-powered rockets that would fly astronauts to Mars in ultra-fast time. The agency has partnered with the US government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to demonstrate a nuclear thermal rocket engine in space as soon as 2027, it announced on Tuesday. The project is intended to develop a pioneering propulsion system for space travel far different from the chemical systems prevalent since the modern era of rocketry dawned almost a century ago. “Using a nuclear thermal rocket allows for faster transit time, reducing risk for astronauts,” Nasa said in a press release. “Reducing transit time is a key component for human missions to Mars, as longer trips require more supplies and more robust systems.” An additional benefit would be increased science payload capacity, and higher power for instrumentation and communication, according to the agency. Nasa, which successfully tested its new-era Artemis spacecraft last year as a springboard back to the moon and on to Mars, has hopes of landing humans on the red planet some time in the 2030s as part of its Moon to Mars program. Using current technology, Nasa says, the 300m-mile journey to Mars would take about seven months. Engineers do not yet know how much time could be shaved off using nuclear technology, but Bill Nelson, the Nasa administrator, said it would allow spacecraft, and humans, to travel in deep space at record speed. “With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever - a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,” Nelson said. Nuclear electric propulsion systems use propellants much more efficiently than chemical rockets but provide a low amount of thrust, the agency says. A reactor generates electricity that positively charges gas propellants like xenon or krypton, pushing the ions out through a thruster, which drives the spacecraft forward. Using low thrust efficiently, nuclear electric propulsion systems accelerate spacecraft for extended periods and can propel a Mars mission for a fraction of the propellant of high-thrust systems. In a statement, Darpa’s director, Dr Stefanie Tompkins, said the agreement was an extension of existing collaboration between the agencies. “Darpa and Nasa have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,” she said. “The space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology… will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the moon and, eventually, people to Mars.” Nasa’s Artemis 2 mission, which will send humans around the moon for the first time in more than half a century, is scheduled for 2024. The subsequent Artemis 3 mission, which could come the following year, will land astronauts, including the first woman, on the moon’s surface for the first time since 1972. • The image caption was amended on 25 January 2023.

This subject matter will intrigue many and discourage others. I was initially in the latter category, but it turns out that Hays is a writer who can skilfully navigate the narrow territory between suspense and melodrama. The main character is Ann Stilwell, a young woman from Washington state who has just graduated from her local college. Ann is fascinated by the “overlooked edges of the Renaissance … their gilt and pageantry … their performance of power”. She loves small objects that “might make me bigger by association”. Ann’s father has recently been killed in a hit-and-run incident, and she is desperate to get away from home. She has a summer internship lined up at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but when she arrives in the big city the MoMa job evaporates and she is recruited instead to work at the Met Cloisters in upper Manhattan, a “jewel box” of a museum consisting of medieval abbeys and priories purchased in France and rebuilt in New York. Ann is immediately seduced by these ancient buildings “polished to a new world sheen”. She loves the fact that her new colleagues are all “beautiful and sharp and inaccessible”, even if she herself feels like “a hick from an unknown school”. Her colleague Rachel is an orphaned heiress with Ivy League qualifications. Ann admires Rachel but feels closer to Leo, the mysterious young gardener who grows herbs (or perhaps drugs and poisonous plants) in the museum’s luscious gardens. Both Ann and Rachel report to the charismatic Patrick Roland, who is working with art dealers to find a particular pack of 15th-century tarot cards. When Patrick begins to suspect that Ann has found the cards he has long been seeking, and is keeping them concealed, his behaviour become threatening, and Ann realises that she is trapped in a world fuelled by jealousy, greed and ambition. The atmosphere of the museum turns to suffocation, possession, control; the summer heat of New York “sticky and thick and slow”. Patrick has always believed that this pack of cards might hold the secret to understanding the workings of tarot. Ann is sure they are a parlour trick, but as the tension at the museum increases, she struggles to separate reality from dream, and it becomes easy for her to believe that everything is decided on the dice or a deal of the cards. The book is all told in the first person from Ann’s point of view. Initially, we sympathise with all her insecurities. Yet as the novel progresses we understand that she is far from reliable. Why did she leave her home town? Are discussions of fate and destiny simply excuses for immoral choices? Rachel seems to be the controlling force. “She turned us all like we existed on her axis.” But who is the manipulator and who is manipulated? Ann has become “no longer an academic, a researcher, but a detective one clue away from greatness”. How far will she go to become “bigger”? All these narrative threads are laid out with care, but I worried that they would not be woven into a satisfying conclusion. This is exactly the kind of novel that often has an extreme ending, in which supernatural and melodramatic elements become a substitute for coherent plotting. Not so here. Late in the book Hays steers away from plot and focuses on character. Increasingly we see that what lies at the heart of this novel is not magic or fate, but two young women caught up in a vicious world of rampant ambition. Finally, there is a satisfying brutality to this book. We have some sympathy when Ann offers her excuses. She has only been learning “the lessons the city teaches me”. • The Cloisters by Katy Hays is published by Bantam (£14.99).

We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before.” The recording aired on CNN on Tuesday, the day Woodward published The Trump Tapes, an audio book of 20 interviews carried out as Woodward wrote three bestsellers on the Trump presidency, Fear, Rage and Peril (the last co-written with Robert Costa). Woodward said he looked into Trump’s claim and was told by an official it was true. “Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would not know about” the weapons system, Woodward said. “But why is Trump bragging about it?” Trump’s cavalier attitude to nuclear issues has landed him in hot water elsewhere. Documents dealing with nuclear weapons policy were reportedly among classified material recovered from Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home, by the FBI in August. That is just one front on which Trump remains in legal jeopardy, others including his incitement of the January 6 insurrection, his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his business affairs and a defamation suit from a writer who says Trump raped her. Trump denies wrongdoing and maintains a lead in polls concerning the Republican presidential nomination. He is reportedly trying to appoint senior campaign aides, including, according to the Post, the Republican operative behind the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks on John Kerry 20 years ago. Woodward, 79, made his name half a century ago, during the Watergate scandal which forced Richard Nixon from office. Nixon resigned when threatened with impeachment. Trump was impeached twice but acquitted by Senate Republicans. On CNN, Woodward said: “I once said to Trump, because he was kind of asking, ‘What do you think the president’s job is?’ And I said, it is to ascertain the next stage of good for a majority of people in the country, not one party or a bunch of interest groups, and then develop a comprehensive plan and execute it. “And he said: ‘Oh, that’s good. That’s great.’ Never did he do this.” Trump “doesn’t understand democracy”, Woodward said, adding: “The United States was one of the rare countries formed on an idea. And that idea is democracy. “Trump doesn’t understand that the January 6 committee has proven that. He does not understand that he’s got to take care of the people. He’s got to give them advice, warning. And he didn’t do this.” CNN also played a clip of Woodward asking Trump, in summer 2020, if the Covid pandemic had made him say to himself, “Ah, this is the leadership test of a lifetime?” Trump answered emphatically: “No.” Woodward said: “He’s dismissing any responsibility he has. And that no is like a thunderclap: ‘I’m walking away from this.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/oct/13/the-hidden-wonders-of-battersea-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T16:20:29Z","webTitle":"The hidden wonders of Battersea power station | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/13/the-hidden-wonders-of-battersea-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/oct/13/the-hidden-wonders-of-battersea-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"The question of whether it was smoke or steam emitted from the chimneys of Battersea power station is less straightforward than either of your previous correspondents suggests.

But Claude Scott (Letters, 7 October) is also correct that steam issued from the chimneys. This came not from the cooling process, but from the curtain of water jets used to wash the smoke clean of anything regarded as injurious or offensive.

The project, known as CopperString 2.0, has long been touted as necessary to provide future energy certainty to Queensland’s north-west minerals province, where miners are considering the potential to extract large amounts of copper, cobalt, vanadium, lead, zinc and phosphate. The government said the project was a “Eureka moment” that would also provide a trigger for new minerals processing, battery manufacturing and new renewable energy generation projects in north Queensland. The proposal, which had been developed by a private company, will now be controlled by state-owned transmission company Powerlink. “CopperString is the most significant investment in economic infrastructure in north Queensland in generations,” the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said. “Unlocking affordable renewable energy and our critical minerals will benefit Townsville, Mount Isa and every town in between – unlocking thousands of jobs and billions in investment.” The government also said the cost of the CopperString project had doubled from early estimates of $2.5bn due to current market conditions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The high-voltage transmission line will be built in three sections, connecting Townsville to Hughenden, Hughenden to Cloncurry, and Cloncurry to Mount Isa. Construction is expected to begin next year, with the project completed by 2029. Within government, there have been some concerns that the pace of renewable development, particularly solar, in north Queensland has slowed in recent years. The CopperString project would provide more options for renewable energy generated in the region. It is hoped renewables can power minerals processing in Townsville and other parts of north Queensland, partly to meet growing global demand for exports with “green” credentials. The energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said the project would allow for the development of 6,000MW of potential renewable energy in north Queensland. The Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the state’s conscious decision to maintain majority public ownership of energy assets would be beneficial, amid pressures on the energy system. “Our Queensland energy and jobs plan makes clear that we will own 100% of our transmission assets,” Dick said. “This announcement delivers on that commitment. And we can only deliver on this commitment because at least $500 million of the cost is being delivered through our new progressive coal royalty tiers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T17:30:25Z","webTitle":"Pine Gap a target as Ukraine invasion raises nuclear war risk, Australian defence expert warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia could become a nuclear target due to its hosting of a US military base at Pine Gap in the Northern Territory, one of Australia’s leading defence strategists has warned. Prof Paul Dibb, an emeritus professor at the Australian National University and former director of Australia’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, said the current Russian invasion of Ukraine carried potential global nuclear consequences, with the possibility of a defeated and humiliated Russia pushed closer to China in “a grand coalition … united not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. In a paper released on Wednesday morning by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dibb said “the risk of nuclear war is now higher than at any time since the Cold War”. “There’s also a real risk that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could escalate to a wider major war in Europe – and perhaps the use of nuclear weapons”. Australia should not feel its geographic distance from the epicentre of the conflict affords it any significant protection, Dibb argued. “We need to plan on the basis that Pine Gap continues to be a nuclear target, and not only for Russia. If China attacks Taiwan, Pine Gap is likely to be heavily involved,” he said. “We need to remember that Pine Gap is a fundamentally important element in US war fighting and deterrence of conflict.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pine Gap is a highly secret US-Australian military installation near Alice Springs. It serves as a major hub for US global intelligence interception, and for satellite surveillance operations for military and nuclear missile threats in the region. Russia is unlikely to be able to subjugate Ukraine in its current invasion, Dibb said, but Ukrainian military is unlikely to succeed in driving out Russian troops entirely. “Most likely there’ll be a negotiated conclusion, probably at the ceasefire talk.” Regardless, Dibb argued, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was unlikely to be deposed as a result, but he would be a leader grown increasingly isolated, and the threat of nuclear escalation was real. “There’s little doubt that Putin is the sort of person who won’t resile from the use of nuclear weapons, particularly if it looks as though he’s losing this war. But he must surely realise that there’s no such thing as the limited use of tactical nuclear weapons in isolation from their escalation to a full-scale strategic nuclear war. “Once we enter the slippery slope of even limited nuclear exchanges, the end result will be escalation to mutual annihilation – something about which both Putin and Xi Jinping may need reminding.” The comprehensive defeat of Russia in Ukraine would bring its own dangers, Dibb argued. “A severely weakened, isolated and smaller Russia might then become more – not less – dangerous for the world.” A Russia left humiliated would be driven closer to China, Dibb said, with the nuclear powers forming what he described as a “grand coalition”, unified “not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. Dibb told the Guardian: “The most serious threat to America would be a de facto alliance between China and Russia, united in the common cause of their hatred for the west.” Dibb said he did not agree with assessments that the US was “finished” as a global power, and could no longer be relied upon as a security partner. “We went through a tricky and rocky period with Trump and if we got him back it would make matters a lot worse for us. But I don’t agree with those who are arguing that America is finished.” He said Putin was motivated by an irredentist desire to restore former Soviet glory and power. “Having studied the Soviet Union and the threat of nuclear war for decades, the depressing thing is nothing much has changed,” Dibb said. “That has a lot to do with that history and with geography, but the threat remains, and remains very real.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"Fears of renewed FBI abuse of power after informant infiltrated BLM protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","fields":{"bodyText":"The FBI’s use of an informant to infiltrate Black Lives Matter in Denver during the wave of protests over the 2020 police killing of George Floyd has prompted concern in Congress that the federal agency is once again abusing its powers to harass and intimidate minority groups. Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon, is calling for the FBI to explain how it came to recruit a violent felon as an informant who then went on to gain prominence among Denver racial justice activists. The informant is alleged to have encouraged protesters to engage in increasingly violent demonstrations while trying to entrap them in criminal misdeeds. “If the allegations are true, the FBI’s use of an informant to spy on first amendment-protected activity and stoke violence at peaceful protests is an outrageous abuse of law-enforcement resources and authority,” Wyden told the Guardian. Wyden sits on the Senate intelligence committee which has oversight over federal intelligence-gathering agencies, including the FBI. He also fought for public disclosure of Donald Trump’s deployment in 2020 of more than 750 officers to his home town of Portland, Oregon, based on what he called “politicised and false intelligence reports”. The FBI’s infiltration of Black Lives Matter in Denver “appears to show another instance of the Trump administration trampling on the rights of Americans in order to divide our country and gain a political advantage”, Wyden said. “The FBI owes the public a full accounting of its actions, including how anyone responsible for attempting to entrap and discredit racial justice activists will be held accountable.” The Guardian contacted the FBI for a response but did not immediately hear back. The new revelations of alleged FBI abuses towards Black activists comes at a paradoxical moment, given the efforts of the incoming Republican House leadership. On Thursday Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump loyalist from Ohio, chaired the opening hearing of his subcommittee on the “weaponization of the federal government” which seeks to show that the main victim of federal overreach is not minority and progressive groups but Donald Trump and his far-right supporters. The actions of the FBI informant, Michael Windecker, or Mickey, as he was known, are revealed in a new 10-episode podcast by the investigative journalist Trevor Aaronson. Drawing on hours of undercover FBI recordings, along with internal FBI reports and interviews Aaronson conducted with genuine racial justice protest leaders, Alphabet Boys pieces together how Windecker inveigled himself into Black Lives Matter from May 2020. Windecker, who the FBI paid $20,000 to spy on the activists, stood out from the crowd. He was white, while most protesters in Denver were African American, and dressed in military fatigues. He drove an ostentatious silver hearse with a boot filled with AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles and other firearms. Despite his glaring profile, Windecker managed to convince activists that he was committed to the struggle for racial justice and could help them cope with volatility on the streets. He bragged about having served with the French Foreign Legion and the Kurdish Peshmerga. As 2020’s long hot summer of protests deepened, Windecker became more prominent in the Denver scene. He also became more proactive in his advice, encouraging activists to consider taking the protests to the next level. He told one Black Lives Matter leader: “I can teach you how to shoot a gun, to hand-to-hand combat, all the way up to like blowing up fucking buildings and guerrilla warfare tactics and sabotage.” Audio clippings from the undercover recordings obtained by Aaronson reveal what Windecker then went on to ask the activist: “How extreme do you want it to go? Do you want to learn to shoot a gun and throw someone around, or do you want to go all the way uptown? If that’s what you want to do, I can make it happen.” The podcast reports that Windecker went on to give an activist $1,500 to buy a gun for him, which led to the individual being arrested on weapons charges. Aaronson also alleges that the informant helped to organize a series of demonstrations in August 2020 that led to violent assaults on police stations. Windecker denied being an FBI informant, but when Aaronson told him about the recordings he fell silent. Congressman Jordan and his Republican team have taken to calling their “weaponization” subcommittee “the new Church committee”. The reference is to the post-Watergate 1970s investigation led by the Democratic senator Frank Church into the rogue behaviour and abuses of power by the FBI and other federal agencies. The attempt by Trump-allied Republicans to claim the mantle of the Church committee to justify weakening federal action against far-right attacks on American democracy has incensed those who participated in the 1970s investigation. Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado who is the only surviving member of the Church committee, told the Guardian that the new House “weaponization” panel was the antithesis of what he and his colleagues had done. “We did not have a partisan axe to grind, we bent over backwards to ensure the Church committee was not a partisan activity,” Hart said. “What is going on in the House today is a purely Republican operation. They are trying to go back to the bad old days by destroying oversight, particularly as it applies to rightwing militias and the insurrection on January 6.” It is perhaps worth remembering what those “bad old days” of the 1960s and 70s invoked by Hart looked like. Before the Church committee succeeded in imposing guardrails on the surveillance and other activities of the FBI, the bureau was largely untethered. J Edgar Hoover, the FBI’s infamous director, ran rampant, instructing agents to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit and otherwise neutralize” dissenting political groups in the US, especially African American ones. Under the vast Counter Intelligence Program, Cointelpro, which ran from 1956 to 1971, informants were used to infiltrate the civil rights movement and the Black Panthers, going so far as to blackmail Martin Luther King in an attempt to cajole him into killing himself. One of the Bureau’s favourite tricks was for its undercover FBI informants to spread rumours that the real leaders of leftwing and civil rights movements were themselves undercover FBI informants. The technique, which had a devastating impact on the Panthers, is known in the trade as “snitch-jacketing”. Alphabet Boys reveals that, in a chilling echo of Cointelpro, the FBI informant Windecker used exactly the same “snitch-jacketing” tactic to sow discord among the Black Lives Matter crowd in Denver during the 2020 summer of protests. At a time when his own cover was in danger of being blown, he planted seeds of doubt about key leaders suggesting they might be cooperating with police. Hart told the Guardian that he had no special knowledge of the events in Denver. But he said that the podcast’s disclosures were a timely warning against complacency. “The Denver story and other recent stories indicate that in some ways oversight may have become lax,” he said. “Maybe – and I don’t know this for sure, but maybe – the FBI is slipping back into the old patterns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"‘Punk was my weapon’: the rebel power of culture in siege of Sarajevo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","fields":{"bodyText":"As a radio operator during the siege of Sarajevo, Boris Siber made use of music to blast the enemy airwaves and destroy their communication. “The Clash, Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols, as loud as possible on the frequencies they were using … they changed frequency, then I found them again. That was my task.” Siber – a member of a hit Yugoslav comedy troupe before the war forced its breakup – also kept up civilian and military morale as a radio comic. “Music and mic were my weapons.” Enes Zlatar Bure was a firefighter by day, helping to extinguish fires caused by exploding ammunition, a position he volunteered for as an alternative to going to fight. By night in the blockaded city, he was the frontman with the punk rock band Sikter. “Our punk rock was a weapon to say: fuck you … you can’t do anything to us. Yeah you can, you can keep on shooting at us, killing us … but we will tell you fuck you, anyway.” The two are among an underground community of Sarajevans who recall in a new documentary film the almost 47 months they spent trapped in their city between 1992 and 1996 under constant enemy fire from Serbian nationalists, and how culture became their key to resistance and survival. Kiss the Future, directed by Nenad Cicin-Sain, which had its premiere at the Berlin film festival, has brought together musicians, artists and journalists who used music and art to rebel against their imprisonment and to assert their right to a multicultural identity amid Serb nationalist attempts to destroy them and their cultural heritage. Cicin-Sain, who was born in Slovenia to a Serbian mother and Croatian father, said he had been inspired by the rise of nationalism around the world to grapple with the story, and felt it was timely to bring it to a new audience. “Our intention was to humanise what it was like to go through something so horrific but in that darkness to find the most beautiful signs of humanity,” he told the Guardian. “Even in the darkest of times, people used music and art as a form of rebellion and survival and to help others. They wanted to find purpose, to feel human, to feel normal.” The protagonists recount their daily struggles avoiding sniper fire, living without water, electricity, gas and heat amid shortages of food, fuel and medicines. At night they took refuge and sought each other’s company in underground clubs and bars, risking their lives as they ran through sniper zones even just to reach the venues. Zlatar Bure recalls how Sikter, his band, played in a club called Obala that took on a legendary status. “We would go there and we would play. People would come and listen; they would have fun. It was kind of like teleporting to another place, like Amsterdam or Berlin, London or New York,” he said at the film festival. “None of us thought about what’s going on outside. It was like a capsule and that’s what kept us sane all the time.” He recalled how if the owners of Obale were able to get hold of petrol to run their generator, they would summon the musicians for a gig. With Sarajevo surrounded on all sides by tanks and snipers, deaths and injuries were a daily reality, he said. “Our bass player came to me one day and said: ‘Oh, our drummer, he lost his hand on the frontline.’ So what did he do? He duct-taped the drumstick to the stump so that he could play – he still plays like that now.” Gino Jevđević, a Balkan punk rock musician, composer and playwright who staged an adaptation of the musical Hair that was performed almost daily during the war, recalled: “The audience literally risked their lives, running from the different bridges to the theatre. Our sound guy died before one of those performances.” Vesna Andree Zaimović, a journalist at Radio Sarajevo who acted as a researcher for the film, said making it had ultimately been like a healing process but also a painful experience, especially when the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred when filming was about to start, reigniting post-traumatic stress disorder in a number of the Bosnian film crew. But she said the Ukrainians’ fight for freedom had given even more purpose to the project. “Our story is a moment of history,” she said. “But it’s also an issue that is relevant and essential for the global political situation today. Everything that happened 30 years ago is deeply connected to the events that are happening close by today.” The longest siege in modern history is estimated to have cost the lives of almost 14,000 people, including more than 1,600 children. It was brought to an end by the Dayton peace agreement, halting nearly four years of war between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. Zaimović’s message to those enduring the conflict in Ukraine and elsewhere, she said, was to remember “you are on the right side of civilisation”. She recalled how her then boyfriend, and now husband, Senad Zaimović, would try to shield her from sniper fire on their daily walk to work at a TV station. He was editor-in-chief of War Art, a daily programme covering all aspects of culture from fashion shows to comedy, and which broadcast from the city via satellite as a deliberate act of cultural resistance. “I was young and in love, so it was a clash between the most elevating feelings that a woman can have and the most brutal horror of the siege of destruction, and this is how most of us in Sarajevo felt,” she said. Cicin-Sain said he had feared the project might have to be called off for security reasons amid concerns of Russian nationalism triggering an aggressive response from Kremlin allies in Serbia due to the conflict in Ukraine. The US actor Matt Damon, one of the film’s producers, said he was honoured to be associated with the project. “It was an incredibly moving experience watching the uncut interviews,” he said. The film culminates in a 1997 concert held by U2 after the group was lobbied during the siege by Bill Carter, a US aid worker affiliated with a maverick humanitarian circus NGO. Much of the documentary is based on his book, Fools Rush In. Attended by about 45,000 people from around former Yugoslavia who flocked to the city, the concert was only possible due to the thousands of steelworkers, truck drivers and construction workers who did everything from reconstructing bridges to renovating the Olympic stadium so the band could reach the war-torn city and for it to host the concert. Across the country, people came out on to the streets to welcome the band and their entourage as they travelled to Sarajevo. The Irish group’s lead singer, Bono, who had visited the city in secret during the war at the end of 1995, expressed his admiration for the Sarajevans in an interview with Carter, saying they were the definition of the phrase “grace under pressure”. The title of the film comes from a speech Bono delivered to the ecstatic crowd at the concert, his voice hoarse from emotion, in which he told them: “Fuck the past, kiss the future.” Sikter, Zlatar Bure’s band, were chosen as the supporting act and opened the show with a punk rock version of the Bosnian national anthem. “If you ask me, that was the most emotional moment,” Zlatar Bure said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine says it has pushed Russian forces back near Kramatorsk; last Zaporizhzhia reactor disconnected after Russian shelling – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","fields":{"bodyText":"It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. He also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. In a joint press conference with Shmyhal, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe in full until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed western sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, adding that Russia’s full resumption of gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 was “undoubtedly” dependent on whether the west would lift its sanctions on Moscow. Concerns over Russian gas supplies continued to drive up energy prices, while the pound and euro slumped after Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. The contract for gas delivery next month in the UK soared by 35%, to 550p a therm. Winter gas prices were also up sharply. On Monday, the euro hit a 20-year low against the US dollar, falling as low as $0.9879 in early trading. Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to knock Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk city and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counteroffensive, with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dnieper River, which links the two sides of the region. The final working reactor block of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. Energoatom told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs despite its disconnection from the grid. Four of the six International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The meeting was the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. The EU is running low on weapon stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The country’s media regular, Rozkomnadzor, had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, its editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate, Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom after the verdict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. Johnson told the Ukrainian president that he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The Kremlin has said diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia could worsen under the next British prime minister. Speaking to reporters before Liz Truss was declared the winner of the UK’s Conservative party leadership election, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he didn’t think “we can hope for anything positive” as the contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine blog today. As always, thank you for reading. I will be back tomorrow. Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to destroy Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said: Our defenders successfully repelled enemy offensive attempts in the areas of the settlements of Bilohorivka, Hryhorivka, Pokrovske, Bakhmutske, Lozove, Spartak, Soledar, Zaitseve and Semihiria. In the Kramatorsk direction, they had tactical success and knocked the enemy out of the positions he had previously occupied. It went on to say that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. It added: As a result of Ukraine’s successful fire attack on Kharkiv Region’s Kupiansk, Russian occupiers lost over 100 troops killed and wounded, and two combat vehicles were destroyed. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has urged residents of temporarily occupied territories and Russian-occupied Crimea to prepare bomb shelters and stock up on drinking water. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: We ask residents of occupied territories, including the Crimean peninsula, to follow the officials’ recommendations during de-occupation measures. In particular, to prepare a bomb shelter, stock up on a sufficient amount of water and charge the powerbanks. Everything will be Ukraine. Russian officials have privately warned that the country may face a longer and deeper recession as the impact of western sanctions spreads in an internal report prepared for the government, Bloomberg reports. The confidential report, which was seen by the network, finds that sanctions by western allies could handicap sectors that Russia has relied on for years to power its economy. It paints a much bleaker picture of the true impact of Russia’s economic isolation as a result of its invasion of Ukraine than officials usually do in their public pronouncements. In two of the three scenarios in the report, Russia’s economy could return to prewar levels only at the end of the decade or later. All the scenarios see the pressure of sanctions intensifying, with more countries likely to join them. As many as 200,000 Russian IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, the report says, while also warning that the country faces a “blockade” that “has affected practically all forms of transport,” further cutting off its economy. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. Shmyhal told reporters after a meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council in Brussels: We need more modern weapons, such as air defence, missile defence and ship defence. Ukraine needed aircraft and more armoured vehicles as there were no signs Russia was willing to end its war, he added. Shmyhal also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. He said: We can replace to a large extent the Russian imports. 30bn cubic meters is what we have in our gas stores, and we can offer some of it to our European partners in order to replace the Russian Federation in the unstable market. In a joint press conference with the Ukrainian prime minister, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Borrell said: We will provide our support politically, financially, humanitarian and militarily as long as it takes and as much as needed. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was also on the sanctions list, as well as the US senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Rick Scott of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia. Penn and Stiller have been outspoken critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have both met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in high-profile shows of support. It’s 7pm in Kyiv.

The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available and that European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season but “we have more work to do”, a US official said.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia had yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives in its war in Ukraine. Russia “continues to lose significant equipment and personnel”, Wallace told MPs in the Commons. He said: It is estimated to date that over 25,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives, and in all if you include killed, casualties, captured, or the now reported tens of thousands of deserters, over 80,000 dead or injured and the other categories. This will have long-lasting impact on Russia’s army and its future combat effectiveness. Russia has yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives. And we are now on day 194 of what was envisaged in total to be a month-long campaign. Wallace likened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to a drug dealer who gets European countries “hooked” on gas. He urged unity across the continent over the winter, adding: If we don’t stand together, we don’t deal with it now, these threats won’t go away on their own and to the people in Prague or Cologne, if you give in to the dealer – the drug dealer, or the guy that gets you hooked on heroin – he will be back for more in a good few years. The final working reactor block of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. In a Telegram statement, Energoatom said: Today, as a result of a fire caused by shelling, the [last working] transmission line was disconnected. As a result, [reactor] unit No 6, which currently supplies the [plant’s] own needs, was unloaded and disconnected from the grid. The company told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs, despite its disconnection from the grid. The plant’s backup diesel generators, which provide power for cooling in the event of a shutdown, have not been turned on, they added. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, warned that the world was “once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster” following the initial news. Galushchenko added that the only way to ensure nuclear safety was the de-occupation of the plant and the creation of a demilitarised zone around the facility. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, has been covering the sentencing of the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison for treason. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom following the verdict. Speaking outside the courtroom, Safronov’s lawyer, Dmitry Katchev, said he was almost lost for words at the ruling. Katchev told reporters: Safronov was given 22 years for his journalistic activity. I want each of you, who are looking at me now, to think whether it is worth staying in this profession. If somebody was given 22 years for doing his job. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was found guilty in the Moscow court of treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. Many will see today’s ruling as an enormous blow to media freedom in Russia, as it comes on the same day that a Moscow court stripped Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside the country. Boris Johnson thanked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for his “leadership and friendship” during a phone call this afternoon, Downing Street has said. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: The prime minister made clear that he believed President Zelenskiy and his people can and will win the war in Ukraine. President Zelenskiy thanked the prime minister for believing in Ukraine and his people and updated on the recent progress of his armed forces in the south of the country. Johnson said he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The spokesperson added: The prime minister told President Zelenskiy it had been a privilege to work with him and support him and the leaders agreed to stay in close touch as friends. The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. “Russia is using energy as a weapon and it is choosing to shut down the pipeline,” a US official said. “The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available. As a result of these efforts, European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season. We have more work to do.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked outgoing British prime minister Boris Johnson for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. The Ukrainian president had a “summing up conversation” with Johnson, he wrote on Twitter: Russian-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia due to attacks by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine last week said it had launched offensives in several directions in the southern region but has since released few details and continues to insist on a “regime of silence” for strategic reasons. The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” due to the security situation. Stremousov told TASS that attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dneiper River, which links the two sides of the region. In the conference, Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, congratulated Liz Truss for her “clear victory” and wished her the best as Britain’s new leader – but said he was not expecting the UK to return to the EU any time soon. A press conference with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell is under way in Brussels. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason, in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. His lawyers told the RIA Novosti news agency they will appeal the verdict. My colleague Andrew Roth is in court covering Safronov’s ruling: French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a “substantive” phone call to discuss the situation on the frontline and to coordinate further defence support from France, the Ukrainian leader said. The talks between the two leaders took more than an hour and a half, according to Zelenskiy. Following the call, Macron said the only way to restore security at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was via withdrawal of Russian troops, the Élysée palace said in a statement. The Kremlin has warned that Russia will not resume gas supplies to Europe until western sanctions are lifted, blaming the “collective west” for its decision to shut down flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was cited earlier today by the Interfax news agency as saying: The problems pumping gas came about because of the sanctions western countries introduced against our country and several companies. There are no other reasons that could have caused this pumping problem. Peskov’s comments mark Moscow’s clearest demand to date that the EU roll back its sanctions in exchange for Russia resuming gas deliveries to the continent. But the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, points out that Peskov did leave some wiggle room. China’s foreign ministry has voiced its opposition to the agreement by G7 countries to impose a price cap on Russian oil, and urged countries to ease the situation “through dialogue”. Oil is one of the global commodities and it is “crucial to ensure the security of global energy supply”, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, told reporters. Mao added: We hope that relevant countries will make constructive efforts to ease the situation through dialogue and consultation, not do the opposite. The EU is running low on weapons stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Borrell said: The military stocks of most member states has been, I wouldn’t say exhausted, but depleted in a high proportion, because we have been providing a lot of capacity to the Ukrainians. He added: It has to be refilled. The best way of refilling is doing that together. It will be cheaper. If EU countries continue to expand their military capabilities in the same way, “the result will be a big waste of money, because this is not a way of cancelling our duplications – there are a lot of them – or filling our gaps”, he said. Borrell admitted that the EU should have begun to train Ukraine’s armed forces a year ago, months before Russia launched its invasion, after several member countries requested such an operation. Had the EU responded at the time, “we would be in a better situation”, he said, adding: Unhappily we didn’t, and today we regret. We regret that last August we were not following this request, fulfilling this request. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. In addition to the latest aid package, Ukraine will also be able to apply to the EU digital economy fund to develop hi-tech training and industry. The meeting today in Brussels will be the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. It was chaired by the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and enlargement commissioner Olivér Várhelyi. During the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war, the invading force was approaching the Irpin River and the gates of the Ukrainian capital. But the river waters suddenly rose, forcing the Russians to turn back and leaving a trail of abandoned tanks and military hardware. Kyiv breathed again and a wetland ecosystem was reflooded for the first time in more than 70 years. Miraculous as it might have seemed, it wasn’t the hand of God that helped save Ukraine. “That’s warWilding,” says Jasper Humphreys, the director of programmes for the Marjan Study Group in the department of war studies at King’s College London, which researches conflict and the environment. “I woke up in the middle of the night, a few days after reading the ‘hero river’ story in the Guardian about how the Ukrainian army reflooded the dying Irpin River and its former wetlands to save the Ukrainian capital,” says the academic, of how he came up with the word. “And I just sat up in bed and whispered to myself, ‘It’s warWilding’.” Read the full story: WarWilding: a new word to describe the startling effects of using nature as a weapon A Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Kherson region said plans for a referendum on joining Russia have “taken a pause due to security considerations”, Russian state media reported. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the occupied Kherson region, was cited by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency as saying: We have got prepared for voting. We wanted to organise the referendum in the near future, but because of the current developments, I think we will take a pause. It is quite explainable from the practical point of view. We are not running before the hounds and are focused on our key task - to feed people, to ensure their security. The Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in Kherson had previously said it had begun preparations for a referendum on joining Russia. The Guardian has spoken with people in the Russian-controlled region who said they were opposed to voting in a referendum or joining Russia. Stremousov was also quoted as saying that the vital Antonivskyi bridge, which crosses the Dnipro river near Kherson city, can no longer be crossed by car after weeks of Ukrainian shelling. Almost all of the Kherson region has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Last week, Ukraine announced it had begun its counteroffensive in an attempt to retake the southern region from occupying forces. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The Basmanny district court in Moscow said it had invalidated the newspaper’s licence at the request of the country’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor. Rozkomnadzor had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Novaya Gazeta’s lawyers insist that the changes did not require presenting the charter to the authorities. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. Novaya Gazeta suspended operations in late March after being forced to remove material from its website on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court verdict in effect bans the outlet from operating. Rozkomnadzor is also seeking to shut down Novaya Gazeta’s website and a print magazine that it launched in July. Two court hearings are scheduled for later this month. Today’s ruling comes less than a week after the death of the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped in the founding of Novaya Gazeta in the early 1990s. Muratov led the procession at Gorbachev’s Moscow funeral on Saturday. Six of Novaya Gazeta’s reporters have been killed in assassinations that the newspaper and human rights groups say were connected with their work, including top investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far. The Kremlin has said they think there is little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also warned that Moscow would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely. The move has stoked renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his government had planned a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under pressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. The Kremlin has warned also warned that it would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. A group of seven finance ministers agreed the cap on Friday in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but Moscow has vowed to halt sales to countries imposing it. The Kremlin said has that they think there was little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister, as they think the leadership contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. “I don’t think we can hope for anything positive,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with the UK. Peskov said: I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse. Asked if Vladimir Putin would send a congratulatory telegram to the next PM, he said: Let’s wait and see who becomes prime minister. Britain’s next prime minister is set to be announced later today, following a weeks-long party leadership contest between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, while the remaining two still stay on a permanent basis. You can read the Guardian’s previous reporting on the issue here: European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely, stoking renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. Reuters reports: The benchmark gas price surged as high as 272 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) when the market opened after Russia said on Friday that a leak in Nord Stream 1 pipeline equipment meant it would stay shut beyond last week’s three-day maintenance halt. The Dutch TTF October gas contract had eased to 256 euros, up 23% on the day by 0723 GMT but almost 400% higher than a year ago. This year’s price surge has squeezed struggling already consumers and forced some industries to halt production. Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia says the West has launched an economic war and sanctions have hampered pipeline operations. The Nord Stream pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe but it was already running at just 20% of capacity before flows were halted last week for maintenance. Russian gas being supplied via Ukraine, another major route, has also been reduced, leaving the EU racing to find alternative supplies to refill gas storage facilities for winter. Several states have trigger emergency plans that could lead to energy rationing and raising prospects for a recession. “Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn’t come from Russia,” said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. A suicide bomber detonated explosives near the entrance of the Russian embassy in Kabul, police said on Monday, adding the attacker was shot dead by armed guards as he approached the gate. The head of the police district, Mawlawi Sabir, told Reuters: “The suicide attacker before reaching the target, was recognised and shot by Russian embassy (Taliban) guards … there is no information about casualties yet”. Russia is one of the few countries to have maintained an embassy in Kabul after the Taliban took over the country more than a year ago. Myanmar’s junta leader has been on a visit to Russia, his second trip there in less than two months, as Myanmar’s ruling military tries to shore up one of its few diplomatic alliances as it comes under growing international pressure. Reuters reports: Min Aung Hlaing, the country’s senior general, has been barred from representing Myanmar at most international gatherings since leading a coup early last year against an elected government led by Noble laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. He first visited Moscow as leader in June last year, when both sides committed to strengthening military cooperation. He also visited in July on what Russia said was a private visit. Russia, a main source of military hardware for Myanmar, was one of the first countries to voice support for the junta after the coup, at a time when it was receiving international condemnation over its use of lethal force against opponents. Myanmar state media said he would attend an economic summit, visit landmarks, universities and factories and his ministers and senior military officials would meet counterparts and “cement friendly cooperation”. Russia has been providing Myanmar with COVID-19 vaccines and Myanmar is planning to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns, as Russia looks for new sources of business amid Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Myanmar’s junta has been hit by a raft of sanctions targeting the generals and the extensive business network the military operates. The United Nations and activists have accused the Myanmar military of atrocities and crimes against humanity and have urged the international community to cut off arms sales, with Russia singled out for supplying drones, jets and air defence systems since the coup. Myanmar’s military says it is fighting “terrorists” and is seeking to restore peace and re-establish democratic rule after a 2020 election it said was marred by fraud. On Sunday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked his forces for taking two settlements in the south and a third, along with additional territory, in the east, citing “good reports” from his military commanders and intelligence head. Reuters reports: Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, earlier posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in the southern area that is the main focus of the counter-offensive. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook over a photograph of three soldiers on rooftops, one of them fixing a Ukrainian flag to a post. Ukraine began the counter-offensive last week targeting the south, particularly the Kherson region, which Russia seized early in the conflict. After Ukrainian forces’ intense shelling of clusters of Russian troops in the region, the Russians have banned movement of residents, forbidding them to cross the Dnipro River, the Ukrainian general staff said on Monday. Russia has launched 25 missile strikes, and more than 22 air strikes, on military and civilian targets in Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the statement added, keeping up its focus on establishing full control over the Donetsk region. The prospect of higher natural gas prices raises the spectre of recession in Europe this winter and that is bad news for the euro which has fallen to a 20-year low against the US dollar this morning. The single currency dropped 0.7% in early trade on Monday taking it below 99c to US0.9880 – its lowest mark for more than 20 years. The pound is also being crushed by the grim economic outlook across Europe and has lost 0.6% to stand at $1.145. Liz Truss is likely to take power in the UK on Tuesday and has pledged to act in her first week of office to tackle the crisis caused by rising energy bills. Full report here: The UK Ministry of Defence says in its morning intelligence update that despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said in a tweet on Monday morning, “… but its forces have still only been advancing around 1km per week towards Bakhmut.” “The political goal of the Donbas operation almost certainly remains to secure the whole of Donetsk Oblast, which would enable the Kremlin to announce the ‘liberation’ of the Donbas. Russian forces have highly likely repeatedly missed deadlines to achieve this aim. “The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that Russian forces are now under orders to complete this mission by 15 September 2022. The force is highly unlikely to achieve this, which will further complicate Russia’s plans to run referendums on the occupied areas joining the Russian Federation.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Sunday that progress was being made to “liberate all our lands, all our people” after the beginning of the counteroffensive against the Russians in the south. “The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this,” Zelenskiy said in a speech posted on Facebook. “These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them.” He also thanked the “warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade” who liberated a settlement in the Donetsk region. The “54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights”, while the “42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated”. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. The Kremlin has blamed European politicians for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, one of its main gas supply routes, saying their economic sanctions on Russia had hindered Gazprom’s maintenance of the pipeline, Reuters reports. “If the Europeans absolutely absurdly make a decision to refuse to service their equipment, or rather, equipment that belongs to Gazprom, but which they are contractually required to service, this is not Gazprom’s fault,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russia’s state television, according to the Interfax news agency. “It is the fault of those politicians who made decisions on sanctions.” Gas prices are tipped to rise sharply in Europe on Monday morning after Russian company Gazprom said it was closing the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline until further notice, citing maintenance issues. Prices have soared since the invasion of Ukraine led to western sanctions on Russia, with the Kremlin responding by cutting gas exports to Europe. Prices had begun to fall last week amid some optimism that Europe could make it through the forthcoming winter months without households and industry having their supplies cut off. But the Nord Stream closure has refeocused markets on the problem and seem certain to send prices up again. Here’s the state of play in the UK natural gas market on Monday morning – prices in pence per therm: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Russia’s war against Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s a little bit after 8am in Ukraine and the main developments you need to know about are here: Gas prices in Europe are expected to surge to record highs this week after Russia shut down a key pipeline to Europe. Many commentators warned that European prices will further rise when markets open on Monday after Moscow scrapped a Saturday deadline for flows to resume through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, saying it had discovered a fault during maintenance. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government had been planning for a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under poressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday The pipeline shutdown pushed the pound lower by 0.37% on Monday morning to $1.147 amid concerns about the economy’s ability to withstand higher gas prices. The euro is also down 0.3% and looks likely to test the recent 20-year low of $0.99005 as traders priced in more risk of a European recession. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy claimed during his Sunday evening address. “The Ukrainian flags are returning to the places where they should be by right,” he added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. Russia said the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine controlled by its troops was calm on Sunday, after UN inspectors said on Saturday it had again lost external power. The last remaining main external power line was cut off although a reserve line continued supplying electricity to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement. Only one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said. Thousands gathered in Prague on Sunday to protest at soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. About 70,000 far-right and extreme-left elements coalesced at a “Czech Republic First” rally to call for a new agreement with Moscow over gas supplies and a halt to the sending of arms to Ukraine on Sunday. A Russian journalist is facing a 24-year jail term for treason. Ivan Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, is facing a “record” sentence on treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. A Russian judge is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. The Russian state should be tried for historical crimes committed by the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa said before the premiere of his new documentary, The Kiev Trial, at Venice. Speaking at a press conference, Loznitza said there needed to be contrition for the wrongs of the past. “History repeats itself when we don’t learn from history, when we didn’t study it and don’t want to know what happened with us,” he said. Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia. The Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources after its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September. China’s top legislator, Li Zhanshu, will attend the seventh Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok this week, becoming the most senior Chinese official to visit Russia since the Ukraine war began. Li, chairman of the national people’s Congress Standing Committee, will pay official visits to Russia, Mongolia, Nepal and South Korea from Wednesday to 17 September, according to Xinhua news agency. He will attend the four-day forum, set to begin on Monday, during his stay in Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/23/strict-new-security-rules-for-adelaide-nuclear-submarine-building-facility-in-bid-to-protect-military-secrets","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Strict new security rules for Adelaide nuclear submarine-building facility in bid to protect military secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/23/strict-new-security-rules-for-adelaide-nuclear-submarine-building-facility-in-bid-to-protect-military-secrets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/23/strict-new-security-rules-for-adelaide-nuclear-submarine-building-facility-in-bid-to-protect-military-secrets","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian government has imposed strict new security rules at the Adelaide site where nuclear-powered submarines will be built, moving to reassure allies that sensitive military secrets will be protected. The new rules require four operators at the Osborne naval shipyard, including those building the Hunter-class frigates and offshore patrol vessels, to guard against espionage and foreign interference. These operators have been ordered to prepare for risks such as “deliberate or accidental manipulation” of critical components and the transfer of “sensitive operational information outside Australia”. According to the new rules, information that must be protected includes layout diagrams, schematics, geospatial information and operational constraints. The operators must carry out background and suitability checks before people are allowed unescorted access to the shipyard. They must record the date, time and duration of access by every person, whether escorted or unescorted. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, quietly rolled out the measures last week under the country’s critical infrastructure laws and confirmed the moves when approached by Guardian Australia. “Our critical infrastructure assets are targets for foreign interference, cybercriminals and other malicious actors who wish to do Australia harm,” O’Neil said in a written response to questions. “By declaring the Osborne naval shipyard a critical infrastructure asset we can implement security measures and build resilience in the facility and its workforce against these threats.” The government has said nuclear-powered submarines will be built at Osborne – the first project under the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK – but it remains unclear how soon domestic construction can begin. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US has previously only shared its naval nuclear propulsion secrets with the UK – in the late 1950s – and US officials are determined to ensure Australia can protect those secrets against foreign spies. With just weeks to go until the three countries announce the Aukus plans in more detail, the new rules designate the naval shipbuilding and sustainment assets at Osborne as critical infrastructure assets. The instrument covers areas overseen by four operators – including the government-owned Australian Naval Infrastructure and ASC. It also applies to the entity trading as BAE Systems Maritime Australia, which will build the Hunter-class frigates, and Luerssen Australia, which has a contract for offshore patrol vessels. Each operator must set out plans to protect the security of its area of responsibility at the precinct and prepare for critical risks such as “the storage, transmission or processing of sensitive operational information outside Australia”. Other critical risks include a stoppage or major slowdown or “deliberate or accidental manipulation” of critical components of the site. Operators must also, as much as possible, “minimise or eliminate material risks” posed by “a malicious or negligent person” or by dissatisfied employees and contractors after they are fired or their contracts expire. The operators will have to provide annual reports to the Department of Defence. O’Neil said the country faced “evolving threats” and the Australian government would “continue to use our national security laws to protect the critical infrastructure assets that all Australians should be able to rely on every day”. In a human rights assessment attached to the new rules, O’Neil acknowledged collecting personal information about employees and contractors had an impact on their right to privacy. But she said this was “reasonable, necessary and proportionate in achieving the legitimate objective of protecting national security and the defence of Australia”. The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, warned this week that the online targeting of Australian defence industry insiders had increased since the Aukus announcement a year and a half ago. Declaring that his agency was taking a “more aggressive counterespionage posture”, Burgess conceded that Australia’s allies and partners were looking for assurances that their military secrets would be protected. Burgess said one of the reasons he was disclosing the successful operation to expel a “hive of spies” from Australia was because “as we progress Aukus, it’s critical that our allies know we can keep our secrets and keep their secrets”. He did not disclose the country responsible for the “hive” but said the spies were working undercover – some for years – with sophisticated tradecraft and wanted to steal sensitive information."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T15:38:34Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant partly reconnected to Ukraine grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has said it has managed to partly reconnect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its grid after the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it had narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” when all lines to it were cut on Thursday. The plant was captured in early May by Russian forces, who are reportedly storing equipment at Europe’s largest nuclear facility, but is still being run by Ukrainian technicians under the gaze of occupying forces. Three of the four power connections the plant relies on to keep its reactors cool were previously cut during fighting, and on Thursday, fires around the plant that Zelenskiy blamed on Russian shelling brought down the fourth, disconnecting it for the first time in its history. Russia blamed Ukrainian shelling and on Friday said it had destroyed the gun responsible. Zelenskiy said the disconnection had put “Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster”. Ukraine’s authorities said backup systems had kicked in to ensure the cooling and safety systems at the plant but as of Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. “Zaporizhzhia NPP nuclear power professionals are real heroes! They tirelessly and tightly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,” wrote Energoatom on its Telegram channel. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. Ukrainian authorities and international experts have consistently warned of the potential for nuclear catastrophe because of fighting around the facility, which sits close to the frontlines in the south. Disconnecting from the grid raises the risk of a catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. A nuclear incident could have disastrous consequences for the immediate population and clouds of radiation could travel across Europe. A mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to visit the plant next week to monitor the situation and take protective measures, said Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, on Ukraine’s Radio NV. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had received assurances from Zelenskiy and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, that the mission would be allowed to reach the plant safely. But Zerkal said she remained sceptical that the mission would reach it. “All the logistical routes are now being worked out,” Zerkal said. “Despite the fact that the Russians agreed that the mission will go through Ukrainian territory, they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission does not reach the object given the situation around [the plant].” Civilians across Ukraine’s south who rely on the plant for electricity, including those in the occupied territories, have experienced power outages with the disconnection of the plant. More that 18,000 people in 72 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were without power as on Friday, the regional administration said. People living in occupied areas already face severe problems accessing medicine, basic goods, information and freedom of movement, and those who disagree politically face repressive measures from the new administration. Thousands living along the contact line have been caught up in shelling. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over whose shells have damaged the power plant and the surrounding area. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia was using the plant as a military base and Washington’s Institute for the Study of War said that Russia had failed to present evidence that the shelling was caused by Ukraine, despite the fact they controlled the territory. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, the plant must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If these break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative impasse, with no significant territorial gains or losses in the last two months. This week, Putin signed a decree to increase the size of the Russian army by 137,000 men, and the UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday it believed he had fired six generals for advancing too slowly. Also on Friday, Ukraine said it would expand the number of districts on the frontline where civilian evacuations would be mandatory, as those areas could be occupied and face central heating problems this winter. Russia’s takeover of the plant is the latest in a long list of challenges Russia and its occupying authorities are facing in running newly conquered territories. Ukrainians continue to use the western-supplied long-range missiles to target infrastructure within enemy lines. Explosions could be heard in occupied Kherson on Friday afternoon as Ukraine’s southern command said it had successfully disabled the Dariiv Bridge to the north of the city. Russia’s RIA news agency reported that the Russian air defence systems had been activated. It is not clear if the two incidents were connected. Video footage released on Thursday show the occupying authorities are attempting to build a pontoon bridge across the river to replace the Antonovskiy Bridge struck by Ukrainian forces last month, rendering it unusable. Russian authorities will hold referendums in newly occupied parts of southern Ukraine, although it appears they will take different forms and may be conducted on different dates. In the city of Melitopol in the occupied-Zaporizhzhia region, pollsters will go door-to-door instead of voters attending polling stations, according to its mayor-in-exile, Ivan Fedorov, citing sources on the ground. Authorities are trying to operate while apparently being attacked from within. RIA reported that a bomb exploded in the building from where the referendum was being planned and Russian passports were issued. In the occupied southern city of Berdiansk, the deputy head of the traffic police was killed on Friday by an explosion, Russia’s state news agency, Tass, reported. On Wednesday, Ivan Sushko, the head of another occupied city nearby, was killed by a car bomb, occupying authorities reported on Telegram. Their deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations that have targeted members of the occupying authorities. On 23 August, Ihor Telehin, the deputy head of the internal policy department for the occupied Kherson region, was also targeted with a bomb but survived, according to Tass."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T17:58:55Z","webTitle":"Energy contracts reform can bring prices down – if the new PM is tough enough | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","fields":{"bodyText":"Welcome news: a consensus is emerging around one way to attack energy costs – stop paying sky-high prices for electricity that is generated in the UK by firms whose costs are unaffected by soaring gas prices. We’re talking about nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar projects and biomass facilities, some of which are making fortunes thanks to the UK’s outdated wholesale energy pricing system. The basic problem, revealed starkly by the crisis, is that electricity in the UK is tied to global gas prices. When the gas price spikes, as now, it has perverse consequences: a nuclear power station is paid as if its input costs had just risen fivefold, when they plainly haven’t. This “clearing price” setup was designed for another age – not one where nuclear and renewables together produce about 60% of electricity in the UK. One idea to crack the problem in the short term (ie before the government settles on a method to decouple gas and electricity prices, which is the plan) was sketched out here on Tuesday. Academics at the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), followed by the consultancy Cornwall Insight, have been pushing the idea of shifting as many UK generators as possible onto contracts for difference, or CfDs. Under CfDs, the problem of overpayments doesn’t arise: when wholesale prices are above a fixed “strike” price, the projects return cash to be recycled into lowering bills. But the CfD setup has been only been widely used since 2017. Before then, the main system for encouraging investment in renewables was renewable obligation certificates, or ROCs, which are still attached to 40% of UK electricity generation. Such projects get the wholesale price plus, for instance, one ROC worth at least £50 per megawatt hour. The arrangement looked roughly fair when wholesale prices were £100 per megawatt hour, but, at £400-plus, somebody is raking in undeserved and unintended windfalls. If it’s not the owner, then it’s middlemen who bought the power via forward-selling arrangements. Thus a switch to CfDs has right on its side. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday that the government is looking at a voluntary shift to CfDs, albeit one that won’t be ready until next year in order to get around the forward-selling wrinkles. The lure to developers would be a 15-year contract that guarantees still-profitable terms when the current emergency has passed and (we hope) gas prices plunge. That sounds roughly like the original UKERC proposal from April. And Energy UK, the trade body, says the industry is backing the plan. All that is welcome – it is movement in the right direction. But, before anyone gets the idea that salvation has arrived, two related points needed to be made. First, the obvious one: the savings may not be huge if ROC generators don’t all sign up for CfDs, or if the new contracts are too generous. Energy UK is projecting only £150-£250 for a typical household, albeit businesses would also benefit. So the second issue is how robust the government wishes to be. A blistering letter in the Times this week from five former energy bosses, including former chiefs of Shell, National Grid and BG Group, backed a more radical idea to address the same core problem: just cap the prices of domestic electricity produced by non-gas generators. The firms could still make returns “that reflect the investment risk”, but energy prices would be reduced at source. Yes, that idea indicates what could be possible with a bit of arm-twisting. An invitation to generators to enter a “voluntary” negotiation is far more likely to produce big savings if it is accompanied with the threat of a windfall tax. The picture is riddled with politics, it should be said. A contract for 15 years is less appealing if your nuclear power station is due to close in five; and the 80% owner of the existing nuclear fleet is EDF, under the control of the French state. Therein lies an awkward negotiation, just as commercial terms for EDF-backed Sizewell C are on the table. And getting nuclear to sign up would be crucial to maximising savings – it is the big player. But the bottom line here is that tackling prices in the wholesale generation market looks an open goal for an incoming prime minister. Some versions of the CfD suggest average household savings of £500-£600 would be possible with maximum corporate participation. But it would require an incoming PM to, first, recognise the problem; and, second, be willing to face down vested interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-10T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Democrat accuses Republicans of ‘power grab’ in North Carolina voting rights cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","fields":{"bodyText":"The North Carolina supreme court agreed to rehear two major voting rights cases in recent days, an unusual move that one Democrat on the court bluntly described as a “power grab” by the new Republican majority. The court will reconsider two recent rulings that struck down the state’s voter ID law and congressional districts. Both of those decisions were losses for Republicans, who both enacted the ID law and drew the districts to give their candidates a significant advantage in elections. The rulings came down when Democrats had a 4-3 majority on the court, but in November, Republicans flipped control of the court and now have a 5-2 advantage. The court will rehear the cases in March. The decision could also upend a blockbuster case pending at the supreme court that would dramatically reshape US election law. The unusual decision to rehear the cases is the latest in a series of rulings that underscore the increasingly powerful role state supreme courts are taking on in redistricting disputes. State supreme courts in Ohio and Wisconsin have also played critical roles in this issue recently. Last year, the North Carolina supreme court court struck down state legislative districts as well as congressional plan that would have given Republicans control of 11 of the state’s 14 congressional districts. The map that was ultimately in place in November led to a 7-7 split in the seats. In December, the court struck down a law that would have required voters in the state to provide one form of acceptable photo ID, saying it was passed to discriminate against Black people. Justice Trey Allen, a Republican elected last year, said on Friday that by choosing to rehear those cases, the court was “exercising our duty and authority to address alleged errors of law”. But Anita Earls, one of two remaining Democrats on the court, harshly criticized that decision in a scathing dissent. Over the last 30 years, the court has received 214 requests to rehear cases and only granted two of them. “Nothing has changed since we rendered our opinion in this case on 16 December 2022: the legal issues are the same; the evidence is the same; and the controlling law is the same. The only thing that has changed is the political composition of the court,” she wrote. “It took this court just one month to send a smoke signal to the public that our decisions are fleeting, and our precedent is only as enduring as the terms of the justices who sit on the bench. “The majority has cloaked its power grab with a thin veil of mischaracterized legal authorities. I write to make clear that the emperor has no clothes.” Mitchell Brown, a senior attorney at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which challenged both the maps and the ID laws, said the rare decision to rehear the cases was “very strange”. “The voting rights wins that we won, voters won in North Carolina have a good chance of being reversed both with voter ID and redistricting,” he said. “If that’s the case that whoever is sitting in the seat can change the law on a whim and not respect precedent, then that’s going to make it hard for people to adjust their conduct to follow the law,” he added. “Because all they have to do is say we’ll follow the law now but we’ll do something different later.” The decision to rehear also could have consequences in the US supreme court. In December, the court heard an argument from North Carolina Republicans who said that state courts did not have the constitutional authority to alter district boundaries or rules for federal elections. It’s an argument based on a novel legal theory, called the independent state legislature theory (ISL), and if the court were to endorse it, it would be a major boon for Republicans. Because the state supreme court is now rehearing the case, the US supreme court could now decide that the issues before it are moot, punting the underlying issues into the future. Doing so would be a mistake, Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, wrote in a post for Slate. The underlying dispute over the power of state courts when it comes to federal elections is likely to keep coming up until the US supreme court says something clear about it. “It is far better for this ISL theory to be resolved when it is not in the context of a disputed presidential election,” he wrote. J Michael Luttig, a well-respected former federal appellate judge, tweeted on Monday that the decision to rehear the case did not necessarily make moot the case before the US supreme court. “For a state supreme court to overrule one of its decisions while it is pending imminent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, would be an act of judicial and political hubris – not to mention disrespect for the U.S. Supreme Court – that I do not believe any state supreme court would do on the eve of the Supreme Court’s decision,” he tweeted. Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, also told NPR that the US supreme court could still issue a ruling on the case. The North Carolina supreme court could wait to issue a ruling in its case until after the US supreme court does. “There’s a little bit of a game of chicken,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-11T16:00:24Z","webTitle":"‘Russia has lost its soft power’: how war in Ukraine destabilises old Soviet allies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","fields":{"bodyText":"As Georgian protesters marched on the country’s parliament against a new “foreign agents” law this week, they bore signs that said “No to Russian law!”, and others decrying the spirit of autocracy and imperialism that is now firmly associated with Moscow’s influence in the region. By all appearances, the law they opposed was a local initiative to allow the ruling Georgian Dream party to crack down on civil society and win forthcoming elections. But that party’s perceived closeness to Moscow and the similarities to a notorious Russian law against “foreign agents” were a popular rallying cry for Georgians who joined the protests. “Everybody knows that Russia is not popular here,” said Kornely Kakachia, a professor at Tbilisi State University and director of the Tbilisi-based Georgian Institute of Politics. “And [the protesters] also want to show Georgians what would be the result of this [law]. Just look at what has happened with Russia.” From Yerevan to Chișinău, and Tbilisi to Astana, the invasion of Ukraine has amplified fears of Russian aggression in some countries and forced others, considered allies, to at least reappraise Moscow’s role as a stable partner. And it has accelerated a trend among young people who were born after the Soviet Union era to take a more vocal stance against Russian influence in the region. “Russia has lost its soft power,” said Kakachia. “They don’t know how to use it any more with their neighbours. They just use this brutal force.” Russia’s actions have backfired in many ways. It has seen Ukraine receive unprecedented military aid from a US-led coalition; Finland and Sweden apply for Nato membership; and the west has shown unexpected fortitude in imposing sanctions on Moscow and resisting the use of Russian energy. Among Moscow’s near neighbours, years of work to cultivate political elites, develop a reliance on Russian security guarantees and instil local nostalgia for the Soviet Union have also been shaken by Russia’s gamble in Ukraine. “How do you live next to this kind of state that is toxic?” said Nargis Kassenova, director of the programme on central Asia at the Davis centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, speaking about Kazakhstan. “It’s difficult because the vulnerabilities are big and they are across the board. We can’t move out of the region, and we need to live next to Russia for ever. So we need to find some modus vivendi. It’s not easy, but maybe it’s a good chance to build up some sovereignty and decouple partially from Russia.” In 2020, Vladimir Putin negotiated a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The settlement gave Moscow a military presence through 2,000 peacekeepers and painted Putin as a deft negotiator. Now, with Moscow’s attention focused firmly on Ukraine, tensions are rising again in the vacuum left behind, with Azerbaijan now appearing to be emboldened by Russia’s inactivity. Since December, Azerbaijani proxies have blocked the sole land corridor into the Nagorno-Karabakh region, leading to shortages of food and electricity there. And Russia’s own peacekeeping contingent, sidelined and potentially undersupplied, has not stepped in. “Not only is Russia distracted but it is simply overwhelmed by its failed invasion of Ukraine,” said Richard Giragosian, head of the Regional Studies Centre in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. “Russia has lost the diplomatic initiative regarding Armenia-Azerbaijan, as well as Nagorno-Karabakh.” But Armenia remained heavily dependent on Russia for security, energy and trade, which had almost doubled in the last year. Directly challenging Russian influence in the country would be “suicidal”, Giragosian said. At the same time, the relationship has become far more unpredictable. “For Armenia, Russia has emerged as a much more serious challenge,” said Giragosian. “The challenge is that Russia has become an unreliable so-called partner, and the [Russian-led] Collective Security Treaty Organisation has become meaningless.” While Russia has appeared distracted from some of its foreign interests, it has increased pressure in other countries in an attempt to blackmail its leaders into loyalty or even provoke a new “Ukraine scenario”. In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has warned that Russia has been planning a coup d’etat. “The plan included sabotage and militarily-trained people disguised as civilians carrying out violent actions, attacks on government buildings and taking hostages,” Sandu said last month, during a press conference where she called for heightened security measures. The media in the Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria has claimed there has been a thwarted attempt to assassinate its leader, and the US has also warned that “Russian actors, some with current ties to Russian intelligence, are seeking to stage and use protests in Moldova as a basis to foment a manufactured insurrection against the Moldovan government”. Russia has been marshalling “energy dependency, church dependency, media, using hybrid aggression,” said Iulian Groza of the Institution for European Policies and Reforms in Chișinău. “Since the war started last year, all the security risks coming from Russia have been increasing. Russia’s imperialistic ambitions, apparently, were not only about Ukraine but about increasing its control and expanding its influence, including in Moldova.” While that was the case before the war, he said, threats of a “Ukraine scenario” were now coming directly from senior Russian officials, rather than just media propagandists. As he and others noted, Russia’s use of resources has come with costs for Moscow, alienating some of those in the country who were sympathetic to Russia, convincing Moldova to reduce its dependency on Russian gas despite the high costs involved, and increasing law enforcement scrutiny of political forces in the country, such as the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, whose political aims appear to align with Moscow’s. More broadly, the Russian strategy has moved toward strong-arm tactics rather than more subtle ways of spreading influence. “Russia has had to switch more and more from a strategy of using soft power and leverage … it was never that soft, but they didn’t need to rely on coercion all the time,” said Bob Deen, an expert on the region, and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank. “In Moldova, they cultivated links with numerous politicians, they have a massive presence in the media, a lot of Russian content gets rebroadcast, and there was a genuine affinity among a sizeable part of the population.” “All of that is diminishing really quickly because of the aggression against Ukraine,” he said, as Russia leveraged its control over gas flows and threatened political instability instead. In central Asia, which includes some of Moscow’s most committed partners, the war had also affected Russia’s image, said Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who is based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. “For some people, [Russia] has seemed comparatively stable – now it’s seen more as an unpredictable country that is no longer the kind of role model that everyone wants to follow,” he said. The generational gap in views on Russia was particularly distinct, he said, with younger people “reflecting a lot on the history of their own countries”. At the same time, he added, the political leadership maintained “a huge element of trust with Russian political elites. I don’t see huge changes in this regard”. “We see that countries are being very pragmatic and using the current economic changes for their own good,” he said, pointing to growth in exports from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Russia, and gas cooperation deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. “What central Asian countries want is to do just enough not to fall under secondary sanctions, and to extract as many possible bonuses out of the whole economic crisis,” he said. Leaders of countries that are even more dependent on Moscow, such as Tajikistan’s Emomali Rahmon, have delivered emotional demands for greater “respect”, including attention from Putin and investment. Russia has notably stepped up its diplomatic outreach to the region, with Putin visiting all five central Asian nations and holding more than 50 meetings (online and in person) with central Asian leaders in 2022. “Because the western direction is closed for Russia, they are more interested in central Asia,” said Kassenova. “We see a lot more attention from Russia, more high-level visits to all central Asian states. Their world shrank – where they can work and what they can do. And central Asia is where they can work,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant temporarily disconnected from grid; death toll from Russian strike on rail station rises to 25 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said the power line was restored and was “currently up again”. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the IAEA could travel on a mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next '“coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to do to the plant. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station on Wednesday. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine”, she said in a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said she was “truly shocked” by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. The hundreds of cluster munition attacks that have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred show a “blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms”, the Cluster Munition Coalition said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel on a mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next coming days. Galushchenko told Reuters: A visit is planned. We are talking about the coming days - this is definitely no later than the beginning of September. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. The new package is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date, bringing to over $13bn the total the US has supplied or pledged to Kyiv under the Biden administration. The last regular power line supplying electricity to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been restored, according to the UN nuclear watchdog, citing Ukraine. It comes after Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: Ukraine told the IAEA that the ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, at least twice lost connection to the power line during the day but that it was currently up again. A Soviet-era monument in the Latvian capital, Riga, has been demolished after the memorial became a rallying point for supporters of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Demolition machinery was used to remove the 79-meter second world war memorial, built in 1985. Latvia’s parliament voted to remove all remaining Soviet statues, plaques and bas-reliefs by mid-November, despite protests from the country’s ethnic Russian minority to keep the memorial. The Hague in the Netherlands has said it will ask for a temporary exemption of EU sanctions against Russia, as it struggles to find a new gas supplier to replace the Russian supplier Gazprom. The city said it held an EU-wide tender in June and July, but failed to attract any bids from potential suppliers, Reuters reports. In a letter to the city council, alderman, Saskia Bruines, wrote: We will ask for an exemption for our current arrangement until 1 Jan. 2023 to guarantee the safety of supply and to facilitate negotiations. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. It affirms Starmer’s support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia and proposes he travels to Kyiv and hold talks with Zelenskiy. The proposed trip follows a previous visit by Starmer to the Polish border, and to visit British troops in Estonia to affirm Labour’s “unshakeable” commitment to Nato. The letter sets out Starmer’s previous meetings with prominent international figures. Sources in the Ukrainian government suggest a date for Starmer’s trip has not yet been agreed, despite what one said was a shortage in August of high-profile foreign guests. They expressed some reservations about not wanting to antagonise the Conservative party after having received strong support from Boris Johnson and his likely successor Liz Truss. However, it is understood the principle of the trip has been agreed and organisational planning is under way, with Starmer looking likely to undertake the journey later this year.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid on Thursday, for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power operator Energoatom said. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant. Three other lines had already been taken out in months of fighting. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” the company said in a statement. The nuclear power plant needs electricity to run cooling systems for the reactors and spent fuel rods. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. During the outage, the plant still got supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connecting the plant to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. Energoatom’s chief on Wednesday told the Guardian that Russian engineers have drawn up a risky blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from its national grid, and connect it to the Russian power network instead. The plan is ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine are cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday, Petro Kotin said. Ukraine and world leaders have warned Russia against attempting to change connections at the plant. They have also called on it to demilitarise the area, after military vehicles were parked in turbine halls and other sensitive areas of the plant, potentially blocking access for firefighters. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. The order, which will come into effect on 1 January, includes a 137,000 rise in the number of combat personnel to 1.15 million. It marks a noticeable increase in army personnel since the last time Russia expanded the size of its military in 2017, when it added 13,698 military personnel and 5,357 non-combatants. The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement: I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine. Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or travelling with their families. In case you missed it earlier, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Its chief, Rafael Grossi, told France 24 TV on Thursday: “We are very, very close to that [gaining access to the facility].” It comes as the last two working reactors at the power plant were disconnected from Ukraine’s electricity grid on Thursday after nearby fires damaged overhead power lines. Ukrainian staff are still operating the plant but the site has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the six-month war. Each side has accused the other of shelling the site, fuelling international concern about the potential for a nuclear accident. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under occupation by Russian troops was disconnected from the national power supply on Thursday, the state energy operator said. In a statement, Energoatom said the plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after a power line was damaged by fires at ash pits in a nearby thermal power plant. Energoatom said: The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid - the first in the history of the plant. Three of the nuclear plant’s power lines “were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks” by Russian forces, the operator said. As a result, the two remaining working of the plant’s six reactors still functioning “were disconnected from the network”. The operator added that the plant’s security systems were working normally and work was under way to reconnect one of the reactor blocks to the grid. A 17-year-old boy has died after Russian shelling in the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, wrote on Telegram: Another massive enemy shelling in the city of Orikhiv and surrounding settlements. The occupier used artillery and fired several hours in a row. A 17-year-old boy died. He was seriously wounded and died on the way to hospital. A 66-year-old woman from the village of Preobrazhenka was seriously injured in the enemy attack. Dozens of private houses had also been destroyed as a result of the shelling, he added. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Fedorov said: Tonight, the headquarters of the occupiers in the village of Pryazovske was blown up. It was there that the Russians prepared for the ‘voting’ and issued Russian passports. Fedorov also claimed that very few people had taken up the offer of Russian passports, although he did not have an exact number. The Guardian has not been able to verify his claims. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. Russia classifies military deaths as state secrets and has not updated its official casualty figures regularly during the war in Ukraine. On 25 March, it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine, 6.8 million of whom have had to flee their country”, she said. Millions of others had been internally displaced, she added. Bachelet said: I call on the Russian president to halt the armed attack against Ukraine. The former Chilean president added that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant must be “immediately demilitarised”, adding: The fighting continues, amid almost unthinkable risks posed to civilians and the environment as hostilities are conducted close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. Hundreds of cluster munition attacks by Russian forces have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred, the Cluster Munition Coalition said in an annual report. Mary Wareham, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement cited by AFP: Russia’s extensive use of internationally banned cluster munitions in Ukraine demonstrates a blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, said his team is “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Asked by French television France 24 if talks on gaining access to the facility had succeeded, Grossi replied: We are very, very close to that. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief cautioned that the operation was “extremely complex” and said he hoped the mission would take place within “days”. Faced with the risk of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia, Grossi stressed that “we need to go there, we need to stabilise the situation, we need to ensure a presence of the IAEA soon”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has also publicly condemned the Russian rocket strike on the Chaplyne railway station. The attack on a train station full of civilians “fits a pattern of atrocities” by Russia, Blinken wrote on Twitter. Russia’s defence ministry has now confirmed its forces struck the Chaplyne railway station in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region on Wednesday. But the Russian ministry said the strike hit a military train that was set to deliver arms to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine says at least 25 civilians died in the Russian strike, which it says was aimed at residential areas. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has discussed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a telephone call with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, the Russian defence ministry has said. Shoigu informed Lecornu “about Russia’s stance on Ukraine’s actions” related to the nuclear power plant during the call earlier today, which was initiated by the French side, the ministry said in a statement. The Russian minister also “noted the importance of sending a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant” and said Russia was ready to provide the necessary assistance to the UN nuclear watchdog’s inspectors, the ministry added. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, has condemned a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station that killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens. Writing on Twitter, Borrell described the attack on Wednesday in the town of Chaplyne as “heinous” and vowed that those responsible “will be held accountable”. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. 25 people have now been confirmed dead after Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday, the Kyiv Independent reports. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. The western Synelnykove district in Dnipropetrovsk oblast has been shelled overnight with eight people injured so far, the Kyiv Independent reports. The southern Nikopol district was shelled with rockets and heavy artillery overnight, while a Russian missile was shot down near the city of Dnipro. Google’s subsidiary Jigsaw is to launch an anti-disinformation campaign aimed at tackling disinformation in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic about Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports. The campaign will run for one month and has been designed to establish resilience to anti-refugee rhetoric online. Google has conducted research with psychologists at two British universities and will work alongside academics, fact checkers, non-government organisations and disinformation experts on the project. It is 9am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy,after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments. Russia plans to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “There are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. Zelenskiy says Russia has placed the world “on the brink of a radiation disaster”. “The Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe a combat zone … Now all of Europe and all neighbouring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution,” he said in a Wednesday evening address. Zelenskiy also called for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to take “permanent control” of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. US president Joe Biden confirmed a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in military aid, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. US officials said the equipment, which will have to be ordered and will not be delivered for months or years, represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Ukraine for the third time since Russia invaded, urging the international community to “stay the course” in its support. Announcing £54m in support, he told Zelenskiy that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Other senior politicians from across Europe travelled to Kyiv to show their support in person. Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. “We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said. “We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Plans by Russian-backed authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol would be a “mockery of justice”, the US secretary of state spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,” he said on Wednesday. Russia has claimed that the slowing pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is deliberate and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said: “Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately.” Ukraine’s top military intelligence official, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia’s offensive was slowing because of moral and physical fatigue in its ranks and Moscow’s “exhausted” resource base. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. On 21 August, imagery indicated that Russia maintained an enhanced military presence at the site, with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres of reactor number five. Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries.” The head of the Kyiv regional military administration has issued an update regarding the series of explosions reported near the city earlier this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia launched a rocket attack on the Vyshgorod district north of the city centre. “Two arrivals were recorded,” Kuleba said seemingly in reference to Russian missiles. The regional head said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces earlier said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am on Thursday as residents were urged to seek shelter immediately. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Charlotte Graham-McLay brings us this report from Wellington. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. He had served in New Zealand’s army for 10 years, the military said in a written statement on Thursday. Abelen had previously deployed to Iraq and was based in Christchurch before he left for Ukraine. He had not told the defence force he was travelling to Ukraine or sought its permission. Two people who knew Abelen – one in Ukraine and another in New Zealand – told the Guardian he had enlisted with Ukraine’s international legion and had fought on the frontline of the conflict. They would not say how long Abelen had been in Ukraine, but it is understood to have been some months. New Zealand’s military would not comment on the circumstances of Abelen’s death because he was not on active duty, but his commanding officer said he was well liked and respected. The United Nations voiced similar alarm to Russian attempts to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol. UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva: Under international law, individuals entitled to prisoner of war status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the armed conflict, even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offence under domestic law.” She warned there are few details available about the potential for such trials, but that images posted by news outlets and on social media appear to show metal enclosures - possibly intended to confine the detainees - being built near a concert hall in Mariupol. The US has condemned any Russian effort to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied southern city of Mariupol, labelling the proceedings “illegitimate.” Reports surfaced this week that Moscow is considering prosecuting Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) under conditions that could amount to war crimes. US state department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement on Wednesday: The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them.” The Kremlin is attempting to deflect responsibility for President [Vladimir] Putin’s war of aggression and distract from overwhelming evidence of the atrocities Russian forces have committed in Ukraine… All members of Ukraine’s armed forces, including domestic and foreign volunteers incorporated into the armed forces, are entitled to prisoner of war status if they are captured and must be afforded the treatment and protections commensurate with that status, according to the Geneva Conventions.” The statement also called on Moscow to “comply with its obligations under international law.” Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. Spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said: We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Kirby said that holding referendums, intended as a prelude to annexation, was proving a challenge to Russian organisers in the face of the near-total opposition of Ukraine’s population. Our information is that Russian officials are so concerned that there will be a low voter turnout … that they’re trying to work on workarounds and how they would how they would communicate that,” he said, but did not describe what those “workarounds” might be. A detailed plan has been drawn up by Russia to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station, as the country marked a sombre independence day, and six months since Moscow’s invasion started. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. US President, Joe Biden, will speak with Ukrainian President, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, following the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the US would continue to “rally the free world” and “galvanise allies and partners” to support Ukraine as the Russian invasion hits the six-month mark. He said the phone call between Biden and Zelenskiy would reaffirm those commitments and would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments and congratulate him on Ukraine’s independence day, according to the White House. “The President’s looking forward to that,” Kirby said, while saying there were no travel plans to discuss for Biden to visit Kyiv. He said if a “trip makes sense,” it would come under consideration. Ukrainian officials are reporting explosions near Kyiv early this morning . Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard in the Vyshgorod district around 3am on Thursday, a district north of the city centre, in an alert issued via its official Telegram account. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, also issued a Telegram update, saying: We have information about several sounds of explosions in one of the communities of the Vyshgorod district. We are clarifying the information. Emergency services are already working.” Kuleba urged resident to seek shelter immediately. According to Ukraine’s emergency services, an air raid alert was issued throughout the region at 3.21am. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

TikTok, it turned out, was using Australia as a test market to find out whether popular music was driving time spent on the app. The experiment finished in March, and TikTok Australia told the Guardian that only half of its users were impacted. But it left the local music industry rattled – providing a discomforting demonstration of the power wielded by the tech industry over artists. Australian musician Kota Banks, for instance, had been on the eve of releasing a new single. As she explained to fans in a post on her Instagram account, she wasn’t even able to post her own songs; she labelled the test “lazy and inconsiderate”. “It’s already so hard for Australian independent artists, and now we’re the test,” she said in her post. “It just feels wack to be a guinea pig.” The move by TikTok highlighted an increasingly urgent issue for new Australian music: it’s becoming harder and harder to reach audiences. Traditional channels such as radio and gigging still matter, but the explosive growth of TikTok in particular has given it a disproportionate power over the industry. As Los Angeles music industry maven Ari Herstand pointed out last year, “TikTok is currently the most powerful free promotional tool that musicians have at their disposal.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads In January, the federal government announced its long-awaited cultural policy, which included a new body to support the sector, Music Australia. At the policy launch, the federal arts minister, Tony Burke, drew attention to the fact that only two Australian artists featured on that week’s charts, with none in the top 20. One of Music Australia’s priorities, he said, would be to address the issue of discoverability – the ability for Australian listeners to find new Australian music – and to ensure that Australian music was “visible, discoverable and easily accessible across platforms to all Australians”. ‘We are creating a vacuum’: the music discovery crisis It’s been three months since Burke’s announcement and once again there are no Australian artists in the top 20 singles on the Aria charts and only two in the top 50 – both by the Kid Laroi. Across 2022, 296 songs appeared in the weekly top 50 singles – only 22 of which were Australian; and there were only five Australian songs among the top 50 most streamed tracks that year, and four among the 50 highest selling. Veteran music manager John Watson says there’s an “existential threat” facing Australian music. “Every year there are fewer and fewer songs being added to the great Australian songbook,” he says. It’s being driven by a confluence of factors, including the increasingly narrow reach of terrestrial radio and the dominance of tech platforms. Consumers who might once have fallen in love with an Australian act on radio or down at their local record store are now more likely to have a US or British act pushed to them by a digital algorithm. In this new landscape, an app with TikTok’s footprint becomes vital. According to market research firm We Are Social, the app reaches 32% of the Australian population aged 16-64, with Australian users scrolling out more than 23 hours per month – a 40% increase since the beginning of 2021. TikTok’s power as a vector for music virality has made it a focus for music labels and managers. “TikTok has really become a critical part of artist storytelling,” said Kristen Bender, a senior executive at Universal Music Group, in a 2021 webinar. Watson agrees. “TikTok is, in my mind, easily the number one place of music discovery, particularly for young people right now,” he says. James Clark from Digital Rights Watch Australia believes TikTok’s power is being driven by a consolidation of music industry power players. “We’ve lost a lot of the infrastructure like smaller labels, smaller curation – like community radio, music magazines, even venues – and now algorithmic curation is driving music discovery more than those human, communal projects,” he says. There’s been much discussion about algorithmic curation and the way in which tech platforms push certain products in front of consumers – but it’s begun to seem like algorithms may matter less on these platforms than more straightforward corporate decisions. At Audible, for instance, Amazon drove a calculated policy that gave listeners a free credit when they “returned” an audiobook they’d bought – in the process, bilking authors of royalty revenue. Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has also made a series of personal decisions affecting content on his site, even ordering Twitter engineers to boost the views of his own tweets. Decisions like these can have a massive impact on the careers of creators, who are beholden to the corporate owners of the platforms they rely on. On top of that, the algorithms themselves can be gamed. There is a vibrant grey market for songs on TikTok and Spotify, where influencers are happy to promote or playlist a new track on their next post – for the right price. On the other side of the equation, big-name pop artists such as Halsey, FKA twigs and Charlie XCX have complained about the incessant demands from labels and platforms for ever more posts. Last year, Halsey told her followers that her record label, Capitol, wouldn’t let her release her new single “unless they can fake a viral moment on TikTok”. Digital Rights Watch’s James Clark says the federal government needs to work harder on cultural regulations to protect local culture. “A thriving cultural scene is rooted in place. No great artist emerges from a vacuum … but we are creating a vacuum. “We need to see a bigger investment in public sector content, in the ABC, funding for community media, and ensuring there are vibrant public spaces out there,” Clark says. “These [digital platforms] capture audiences and then they capture creatives – we do need to look at how to break down their power.” ‘What are TikTok trying to prove?’ A number of prominent Australian labels and managers refused to comment for this story, an indication of the risk at play when criticising platforms they rely on. But Aria’s CEO Annabelle Herd tells Guardian Australia that while TikTok’s experiment only lasted a few weeks, it had “a real impact” on artists and “didn’t make any sense”. “We know music is such an important part of the platform,” she says. “What are they trying to prove, and why are they doing this to Australia?” Watson believes the app wanted to show artists that they needed TikTok more than TikTok needed them – and to build a stronger case when negotiating with record labels over music royalties, which TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, has only recently started paying. TikTok has also launched its SoundOn app in Australia, which it is selling as a creator-friendly platform for independent artists. “TikTok is seeking to show that by removing these artists from the platform, they can do more harm to the artists than the absence of the artists is doing to the platform,” Watson says. “That the benefits of quote unquote ‘exposure’ is such that artists should be willing to provide their content for free. “They’re trying to say: we don’t need that content, because people will continue to consume TikTok and they won’t notice if artist X or label Y is not on their platform.” The experiment may have proved the opposite. In March, Bloomberg reported the number of people using TikTok in Australia actually fell following the test, suggesting the platform still needs users to access the artists it had tried to cut out. But the essentially unregulated nature of tech platforms poses interesting questions for policymakers. The arts minister has signalled the federal government is moving to impose local content quotas on streaming video services, but their intentions for streaming audio are less clear. In February, Burke told the National Press Club he will send the issue to the newly created Music Australia for advice. The possibility of local quotas for TikTok in Australia may be the least of ByteDance’s concerns. In March, its CEO Shou Zi Chew was hauled before the US House of Representatives for tough questioning on the company’s practices and future. The US, UK and Europe have banned TikTok from government mobiles, and in April the Australian government followed suit. But for Australian musicians, the quota question across all platforms is becoming pressing – and the industry hopes the government will act on its promises. As Burke told the National Press Club: “The streaming services do not only have available what you might choose; they also push music to you.

An amber warning for heavy snow is in place for parts of eastern Scotland, including Inverness and Aberdeen, from 3pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office warning drivers are expected to become stranded. With up to 15cm of snow expected in the area, it said some rural communities could become cut off, there will be rail and air cancellations, mobile phone coverage may be affected and power cuts were likely. Yellow warnings for snow and ice are in place for Wales, Devon and Cornwall, the West Midlands, the north-west, south-western Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the public was urged to travel only if “absolutely essential” in some parts of the country. Avon and Somerset police said it was advising the public to stay off the roads after receiving more than 100 reports of road-related incidents in five hours. Fifty-three road traffic collisions were reported to police between 6-11pm on Monday, the majority a result of the freezing weather conditions. On Tuesday morning, a serious incident was declared after a doubledecker bus carrying 70 passengers overturned on the A39 in Somerset, leaving dozens injured. Supt Mark Runacres said: “We are advising the public to only travel where absolutely essential due to the treacherous driving conditions. If travel is necessary, we ask the public to take extreme caution and allow additional time to travel.” The Met Office said Monday night was the UK’s coldest of the year so far, with a low of -9.8C recorded in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, and all of England is expected to experience cold weather until 9am on Friday. Jason Kelly, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Cold, icy and sometimes snowy conditions are in the forecast this week with the UK seeing more of a north-westerly regime, with temperatures well below average for the time of year. Wintry showers are likely at points through the week in the north of England.” The UK Health Security Agency has also encouraged people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency (EA) said its officers were working around the clock to protect homes and businesses along the River Severn, with more than 25 flood warnings in place across Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. Across England, there were 83 flood warnings in place on Tuesday afternoon, meaning flooding is expected, with East Sussex, the Isle of Wight and other areas in south-east England predicted to be affected. The EA said rivers in the West Midlands and north-east England were likely to remain high for the next four days and could lead to further flooding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-10T15:42:58Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on homeowners associations: ‘Glorified debt collectors with the power to upend your life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","fields":{"bodyText":"John Oliver looked into American home ownership on Last Week Tonight, and particularly the private governing structure of homeowners associations (HOAs). (For millennials under 35 and unlikely to ever own a home – “sorry, that is the deal you made when you decided to be born after 1988,” Oliver quipped – Last Week Tonight prepared a segment on Chuck E Cheese.) But for everyone else, HOAs are a sneakily common force in daily life – 29% of the US population lives in community associations, and 82% of all single-family homes sold in 2021 were in one. They are also often widely loathed. Oliver pointed to one Facebook comment claiming good HOAs are “one vote away from hellish nightmares”, which is a “pretty intense comment”, he said. “It’s also the DNC’s sole campaign message for the last two elections.” Oliver then dug into what HOAs are and how they wield “surprising power” to “wreak havoc in people’s lives”. Formally, HOAs are run by an elected board of fellow homeowners. They collect dues averaging around $200-$300 a month to manage amenities such as pools and playgrounds, and can enforce architectural and landscaping guidelines often mandating a uniform aesthetic. Usually, such enforcement comes in the form of fines, which can be ludicrously applied. Oliver pointed to the example of one disabled veteran, whose HOA used Google maps to spy on his backyard and fine him for having a shed that was not approved, nor visible from the street. “If you’re relying on the achievements of the space program to find out what is in someone’s backyard, it’s probably not your business,” said Oliver. HOAs are often not voluntary – developers write them into deed restrictions, with automatic membership upon purchasing a new home. “And they’re set up as not-for-profit private corporations that can often function like a local government,” Oliver explained. “Basically, the way HOAs work is they get to set the rules and select the punishment for breaking them,” he said. “Think of it like Disney World. When you walk into the mouse’s house, you play by the mouse’s rules. And if you step out of line, Goofy is allowed to break your fucking knees. “HOAs can have the authority of a government and collect fees and fines like one,” he added, “but when it comes to accountability, they can actively resist it in ways that government officials could only dream about.” And they can reinforce the racial divides that have long plagued American home ownership. Oliver cited the example of an HOA in Denton county, Texas, which oversaw 2,200 homes and passed a rule that would ban renting to anyone using a publicly financed or subsidized housing program such as Section 8. The measure threatened to displace more than 150 families, 93% of which were Black. “I know that those HOA officials might not think of themselves as racists, but 93% is a pretty solid A for racism,” said Oliver. That policy is now under investigation, although there is no state or federal law that forbids HOAs from enacting such bans. “It’s basically a segregation loophole which, by the way, would be a pretty good slogan for the suburbs,” he noted. Even worse, the majority of the HOAs hire professional companies to handle their day-to-day needs. “The problem is, when you introduce for-profit companies to find problems in your neighborhood, things can change fast,” said Oliver, as people whose job it is to drive around and find infractions will find issues. Oliver cited the story of a woman charged $17,000 in late fees for infractions such as visible trash cans, an unsightly hose, lack of power washing and distasteful lawn art. Another “incredible power” that HOAs have over homeowners is the ability to foreclose on one’s home. Colorado’s HOAs for example, filed more than 2,400 foreclosure cases from January 2018 to February 2022. “Which is one of those things that sounds ridiculous but is absolutely true,” said Oliver, “like how there is four times as many chickens as people on Earth, or Lenny Kravitz is Al Roker’s second cousin, or that the first song Charlie Puth ever masturbated to was This Love by Maroon 5.” The nation’s 350,000 HOAs are largely unregulated, as the government considers disputes with them to be private matters. The state of New York’s attorney general’s office says “there is no government agency that can help unhappy owners who are having problems with their homeowners association,” adding “good luck!” “Which is basically just a cute way to say ‘you’re fucked!’” said Oliver “It’s like ‘you’re fucked’ washed her hair and put on a little church dress. “I’m not saying that all HOAs should immediately be gone,” said Oliver. “For a start, some people do like theirs and besides, right now local governments just aren’t equipped to suddenly take over the services like trash collection or maintenance that they provide. But at the very least, states should be looking for ways to avoid the worst possible outcome for homeowners who simply find themselves in a tough spot.” Oliver suggested measures such as mandating HOAs offer payment plans on unpaid debt before taking legal action and banning on foreclosures based on fines and attorneys fees. “At their best, HOAs are annoying student council adults telling you to trim your shrubs and move your trash cans,” he concluded. “But at their worst, they are glorified debt collectors with the power to upend your life and expel people from a neighborhood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T16:00:05Z","webTitle":"English hospitals make emergency plans amid winter power loss fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","fields":{"bodyText":"English hospitals have increased emergency fuel supplies and put staff on standby to postpone operations and switch off X-ray scanners amid heightened concerns over energy provision this winter. NHS hospital trusts across England have put their power plans under the microscope as they look to protect patients from potential outages for lifesaving equipment. Responses to freedom of information requests to 63 NHS trusts revealed that 41 are re-examining their plans for a loss of power for this winter. A further 10 trusts said they conducted routine reviews of their business continuity plans this year, while 12 had not revised their strategies. Concerns over the combination of a cold snap and a sudden cut-off in Russian gas supplies this winter have led ministers to examine power winter power supplies. National Grid warned in October that, in extreme circumstances, it would be forced to enact planned three-hour power cuts with a days’ notice. Major hospitals are exempt from this system, called rota disconnection, however businesses and the government have studied their plans for a complete power failure on the network. The Guardian revealed last month that Whitehall officials had “war gamed” emergency plans to cope with extended energy blackouts. Documents marked “official sensitive”, which warn that in a “reasonable worst-case scenario” all sectors including transport, food and water supply, communications and energy could be “severely disrupted” for up to a week. Despite the pressure on the NHS budgets, the responses show that most hospitals have up-to-date plans and backup generators to ensure lives are not lost due to lack of power. A quarter of hospital trusts said they were able to run indefinitely on backup diesel generator power, providing they had access to fuel supplies. Just over 10% said they could run on backup power for 10 days. St George’s University Hospitals, which serves 3.5 million people in south London, said its backup generators had eight to 12 hours of supply and it was in the “process of obtaining an additional contract for emergency oil supply”. The Royal Marsden, which has hospitals in London and Surrey, said its generators could run constantly and it is keeping a higher levels of fuel in existing tanks. Frimley Health, also in Surrey, has also increased fuel volumes. Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals in Surrey said it had brought in additional fuel suppliers, bought spare electrical parts in case of failure, developed “more detailed action cards”, and acquired other equipment for this winter. University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, in north-west England, said that, in the event of planned power cuts, it would consider the “introduction of a shift system to align staff to the outage times”. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent said that, in the event of a loss of power, it would advise theatres and other specialists to “consider if they carry out essential procedures only”. The Royal Wolverhampton said if there were warnings of outages, staff would be advised to reduce or stop non-essential services. It added that some high-powered scanners and a linear accelerator used for cancer treatment, were not protected with essential power. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust plans to tell staff not to use kettles and microwaves during maintenance of key equipment, including defibrillators, to prevent unexpected power surges. The revised power plans come before what is expected to be another gruelling winter for NHS staff. The NHS will grind to a halt on 20 December under plans being discussed for a coordinated Christmas strike in England and Wales by nurses, ambulance workers and hospital staff. Energy companies have also been urged to protect at-risk consumers, including those on dialysis, from being cut off. National energy blackouts this winter would put more than 1.6 million people at heightened risk of a serious injury in their own home because of the poor quality of their property, an analysis from the Centre for Ageing Better reveals. Holly Holder, the deputy director for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: “We are calling for the rollout of a national retrofit programme to make homes warmer, safer and more energy efficient.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-16T12:02:55Z","webTitle":"The case for a new Keynesianism when Labour returns to power | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"There is little point in James Meadway regretting Keir Starmer’s lack of spending commitments while maintaining the fiction that “spending increases will have to be met by at least some tax rises” (Keir Starmer may win power, but he won’t be able to turn the UK around on the cheap, 9 January). The government creates new money by instructing the Bank of England to credit private bank accounts to pay salaries, benefits, grants, etc. It needs neither taxes nor borrowing (its own money) to do this. Taxes cancel some of that money, but they have other important purposes. Tax rises to accommodate a “fiscal rule” serve no purpose. The government’s economic remit is to facilitate the fair and efficient allocation of the real resources available – in the world’s sixth-richest country, we have plenty. It does this by spending and by curbing the power of other economic actors via taxation and regulation. We had the same real resources after the financial crash as we did before. There was never a need for austerity. It is time that the monetarist policies that caused the crash were replaced by a new Keynesianism in this age of free-floating fiat money. Carol Wilcox Highcliffe, Dorset • It was very disappointing to read James Meadway, the director of the Progressive Economy Forum, perpetuating an underlying institutional myth about government expenditure. How do you know if it’s spending or investment? In popular political discourse, if money is being devoted to the creation of private profit, it’s investment, but if it’s being devoted to health, security and education, it’s spending. What nonsense. Intelligent investment is about allocating resources in the most effective way, which will sometimes be through the market, and very often through public services. Either way, if it’s done right, it’s investment, not pouring money down the drain. Please don’t reinforce the false paradigm that private expenditure is always wise and good, and public expenditure foolish and spendthrift.

Almost eight decades on, the spectre of nuclear war has returned with greater menace than at any time since the cold war, amid Vladimir Putin’s threats against Ukraine and North Korea’s seemingly unstoppable rise to the status of nuclear-armed state. Despite their advancing years, Mimaki and other survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and – three days later – Nagasaki are again urging world leaders to ensure that the human misery of nuclear warfare remains consigned to the final, catastrophic days of the Pacific war. “My greatest fear is that the Ukraine conflict will escalate,” Mimaki, 80, told the Guardian at the Hiroshima office of Hidankyo – a confederation of A-bomb survivor groups he has co-chaired since last year. “When I think about what Putin said recently, I wouldn’t be surprised if he used nuclear weapons. And what would the US response be? We could be on the verge of another world war. I don’t think Putin is listening.” The destruction of Hiroshima has become a gruesome reference point since Putin first threatened to use nuclear weapons in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from supporting Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion. The prospect that he could order the use of a smaller “battlefield” nuclear weapon to alter the course of the war in Moscow’s favour prompted Joe Biden to warn that the world was on the brink of “Armageddon” for the first time since the Cuban missile crisis. As Biden conceded this month that the US would soon be confronted by two major nuclear weapon states – Russia and China – North Korea claimed that its recent volley of missile tests were intended to simulate a tactical nuclear strike against South Korea. “The power of the Hiroshima peace message is as strong as ever, but its resonance is even greater given the current international situation,” said Makoto Kubo, assistant director of Hiroshima city’s international peace promotion department. “It isn’t just relevant to North Korea and Russia, but to every country that possesses nuclear weapons.” More than 60 countries have ratified a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use of nuclear weapons, but they do not include any of the recognised nuclear states or countries, including Japan, that fall under the US nuclear umbrella. The failure to make progress on disarmament prompted the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, to warn in August that humanity was “in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki”. The mayor of Nagasaki, Tomihisa Taue, said he feared the devastation visited on his city in 1945 had “not got across to the world well enough, and [is] looking to become a reality”. Drawing on faint memories and conversations with his mother, Mimaki knows those horrors only too well. He and his family were living in Tokyo when his father, who was from Hiroshima, evacuated them to his home town after large areas of the Japanese capital were destroyed in the March 1945 firebombings. Months later, the Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, instantly killing between 60,000 and 80,000 people, with the death toll rising to 140,000 by the end of the year. Mimaki recalled watching, petrified, as people who had been in downtown Hiroshima when the bomb exploded passed his home, 17km from the centre, as they fled the fires that raged across the city, the air thick with radioactive ash. “Their hair had been burned off and they were begging for water,” he said. Today, the number of people officially recognised as having died from the effects of the Hiroshima bomb stands at just over 330,000, while the average age of the 118,000 survivors has crept up to 84. “I’m reasonably healthy, but I can sense my physical strength and memory weakening,” said Mimaki, who has taken his message to the UN headquarters and gives talks to schoolchildren about his experiences. “But our aim is still to achieve a world without nuclear weapons while we are still alive.” Hiroshima’s recovery began in the immediate aftermath of the attack; today, the burned-out shell of the “A-bomb dome” and the sprawling peace park are among the few physical reminders of the attack. It will have the opportunity to remind world leaders of the horrors of nuclear annihilation – whether in a Japanese city or, potentially, on a Ukrainian battlefield – when it hosts the G7 summit next May. “I want them to go to the peace museum and look at the photographs of children with their skin and clothes hanging off,” Mimaki said. “Let’s show them the reality of nuclear war, so that they go home with those images imprinted on their minds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T21:27:02Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi’s rock-star welcome to Sydney is part concert, part political rally and all about soft power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","fields":{"bodyText":"It was a rock-star welcome that would have made any of the world’s biggest stars blush. But not Narendra Modi. Entering a heaving Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney’s west on Tuesday night, he was greeted by a roaring crowd who cheered and clapped throughout his speech. The Indian leader, who has been prime minister since 2014 and is vying for a third term at next year’s elections, spoke for nearly an hour, on both Australian-Indian relations as well as Indian economic and cultural successes. “There are three Cs that defined our relationship with Australia: the commonwealth, cricket and curry. But now it is three Ds: democracy, diaspora, dosti [friendship],” he started. “Now there are also three Es that define the relationship: energy, economy and education.” Modi went on to list popular eateries in Harris Park, a central suburb for the Indian diaspora in Sydney, much to the delight of the crowd: “I want you all to take my friend Australian PM Albanese to these places.” He said: “Mutual trust and mutual respect have not developed only due to the diplomatic relations of India-Australia. The real reason, the real power is – all of you Indians who live in Australia.” The arena event felt closer to a concert than a public appearance by two world leaders, as attendees held up flags and signs, and hung on Modi’s every word. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Organised by the Indian Australian Diaspora Foundation, the event ran for hours before the leaders arrived and featured dances and singing by local and international groups. At one point, a countdown was featured on the massive screens above the centre stage, with every update cheered by the crowd. “Man, this is awesome,” said Bhoomika Sampath, one of the volunteers at the event. “We are very proud of our country, we each hold on to that pride and want to be a part of it. We want to participate, and thats why we’re here.” The event resembled a political rally, with Modi regularly inviting the audience to cheer for India and its economic or cultural achievements, such as the size of the country’s workforce, the number of smartphones, the growth of fintech startups and the uptake of Covid vaccines. And while Modi covered a lot of ground, he did not mention the suppression of free media in India, with the Committee to Protect Journalists reporting 32 journalists and media workers killed since 2014. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party government is also accused of using repressive and intimidatory tactics against political opponents and civil society organisations, and of unlawfully discriminating against Muslims. None of these issues were addressed by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, or the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, who opened for Modi. His visit comes as the diaspora is exploding, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics forecasting the community will reach 1.07 million by 2035. Rajni Anand Luthra, from the local media platform Indian Link, said the repetition of lines about Indian success aimed to engage the local diaspora’s sense of identity and patriotism. “Indian soft power is so strong at the moment that something like this gives the community confidence and a big sense of identity, and you can see it in the way the community is changing,” Luthra said, adding: “We will play Bollywood music from our cars and bring our food into the office – the community is not shy about itself any more. And to attend an event with Albanese instills confidence in that identity.” Albanese, who announced the opening of the new Centre for Australia-India Relations in Parramatta, said he had never seen a reception like this. “The last time I saw someone on this stage was Bruce Springsteen and he did not get the welcome that prime minister Modi has got,” he said. “Prime minister Modi is the boss.” He said the centre would help foster stronger ties: “We want to see more connections, more Australian and Indian students living and studying in each other’s countries and bringing those experiences home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Police should be given power to charge suspects, say senior officers in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","fields":{"bodyText":"The police, rather than independent prosecution lawyers, should have the power to charge suspects in most cases, three senior police chiefs have said, as they warned of a deepening crisis in the justice system. The controversial change is being called for by the chief constables of the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire forces, respectively the second, third and fourth biggest in England after the Met, the Guardian has learned. They say the Crown Prosecution Service should be stripped of having the sole power to authorise charges in most cases, helping to drag the justice system out of a worsening crisis. This would include for crimes such as domestic abuse, harassment, burglary, robbery, theft, knife crime, and violent crime. The chiefs say delays in charging suspects are leading to the guilty walking free and delayed justice, as victims and witnesses tire of long waits. They say the CPS – which faced government cuts under austerity – should concentrate on the most serious cases, but is “far too thinly spread” to manage its current workload and increasingly complex cases. The police chiefs say sticking “plasters” no longer work and radical change – in effect a return to the way things were before the CPS was created in 1986 – is necessary and could be enacted quickly. In an unprecedented intervention, the three police chiefs say: “The ability for the CPS to give timely charging advice (namely while the suspect is under arrest and in the cells) is broken; not because of anything the CPS has done, but because they do not have the resources or the people to do what they used to. “We have tried to fix it together over the last two years, but the plasters are not sticking and things are getting worse. So for the sake of victims, witnesses and all in the criminal justice system, we need to replace it now, by restoring to the police the ability to charge most offences whilst suspects are in the cells.” The call is made by Craig Guildford who leads the West Midlands force, Stephen Watson of Greater Manchester police and John Robins of West Yorkshire police. All three senior police chiefs told the Guardian: “The director of public prosecutions needs to give the right back to the police to make charging decisions there and then in far more cases: domestic abuse, harassment, burglary, robbery, theft, knife crime, violent crime. “We used to do this, officers want it, victims want it, defence lawyers want it, and we are sure the courts do too, but the system keeps saying no. We are trying to help free up CPS and partner agency work to do what they should be doing – prosecuting, not administration.” The causes of big backlogs in the justice system include cuts made by the government as part of austerity, with that then exacerbated by the turmoil caused by Covid and subsequent lockdowns. Police in England and Wales report that their charging rates of suspects plummet in recent years. The three senior chief constables say: “Where is the evidence to support our call? In March 2015, 16% of crimes were resolved with a charge and/or summons and now it is 5.6%.. “This is not because police have suddenly become less effective. It is because of so called ‘attrition’ where victim disengagement occurs and results in fewer charges due to time delays and a feeling of being unsupported by a seemingly faceless and insensitive system.” Watson, reputed to be one of the favourite police chiefs of the home secretary, Suella Braverman, told the Guardian that long waits led to the lifeblood of the justice system – victims and witnesses willing to testify and support prosecutions – giving up. “We lose victims and witnesses in the process. Nothing reassures victims and witnesses like a charge – it’s validation. Delays lead to victims and witnesses losing faith in the system,” he said. The claim by the three senior chief constables – that the crisis is worsening – is embarrassing for the Conservatives – who made the cuts in the first place, and for the government also as it claims to be fixing the problem. The police chiefs say: “The CPS like many other public bodies, including the police and courts, had to change through austerity, we all get that and it led to a commensurate reduction in capacity. Yet we appear to be trying to do the same things, despite some elements of the system being broken through no fault of any agency.” The call will be seen by some critics as self-serving. Policing is under fire for scandals involving its own officers’ wrongdoing and for a perceived decline in effective crime-fighting. Jo Sidhu KC, a barrister and former chair of the criminal bar association, said the police chiefs’ plan was no substitute for proper funding and risked merely shifting the problem. He said: “Simply giving the police more responsibility for charging suspects will do little to reduce the unprecedented delays and huge backlog that have accumulated over recent years and which are now baked into the criminal justice system as a result of a deliberate government policy of neglect and disinvestment. “If a wrong decision to charge is made by the police then it is the CPS who will have to step in to reverse it, causing unnecessary additional delays and further distress to complainants. If the police wrongly fail to charge a suspect then this can also cause real injustice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T22:36:51Z","webTitle":"£1m paid to Octopus Energy customers as part of power saving scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","fields":{"bodyText":"More than £1m was paid to energy customers with Octopus Energy on Tuesday as part of a power saving scheme.

It had been feared that the mixture of weather conditions, demand and generation issues could lead to blackouts. Octopus, British Gas, EDF and E.ON are all taking part in the scheme. It is only available to households with smart meters. The average customer was paid £2.50 in points for reducing their usage by an average of 60%. The top 5% were paid £15 in points. The Octopus deal can see the points turned into cash, “prizes” or donated to a fund for customers in need. More energy was saved on Tuesday, when the payment was larger, than on Monday, the firm revealed. Less than £1m was paid out on Monday. Energy firms had advised that customers could delay cooking their evening meal, or putting loads of washing on – as cookers and washing machines can use lots of electricity. The total amount of energy saved was about 250MWh (megawatt hours) nationwide, the same as the city of Liverpool going off grid for an hour, PA Media said. After being in action for two days, the scheme was not triggered for Wednesday. There had been trials before it was used properly for the first time this week. It will be in place until March 2023, the National Grid has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-22T01:03:05Z","webTitle":"Australia must play an active role in ending nuclear arms race, cross-party MPs urge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian MPs from across the political spectrum have called on the Albanese government to join a landmark treaty banning nuclear weapons, declaring that the weapons “fundamentally undermine our peace and humanity”. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, a cross-party group of MPs warned of “escalating nuclear threats and provocations from nuclear-armed states” and said Australia must play an active role to end the nuclear arms race. The new treaty is a chance for Australia to stand with its neighbours in south-east Asia and the Pacific, according to the Labor MP Josh Wilson, the Liberal MP Russell Broadbent and the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John. Speaking out on the second anniversary of the UN treaty coming into force, the MPs said the agreement was supported by “the clear majority of our regional neighbours with whom we share a common goal of peace, cooperation, and security”. They called for Australia’s “timely signature and ratification”. “The members of this cross-party group are ready to work constructively with the Albanese government to ensure Australia becomes a state party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,” the MPs wrote. The US and other nuclear-armed countries are firmly against the treaty, which imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. But the treaty now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it is strongly backed by neighbours like Indonesia and New Zealand. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In opposition, Labor committed to sign and ratify the treaty, but only “after taking account” of several significant factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. Gem Romuld, the Australian director of the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the organisation hoped the cross-party statement would “spur the Albanese government on to fulfil its pre-election commitment”. “Nuclear disarmament is an urgent humanitarian issue above party politics,” Romuld said. “We can’t trust any of the nuclear-armed leaders to do the responsible thing and disarm; pressure from the global majority of nations, using the nuclear weapon ban treaty, is essential to move forward.” The MPs said the treaty was intended to create a new international norm on the illegitimacy of nuclear weapons. They said history showed “prohibition treaties on weapons of mass destruction are essential to facilitate progress towards their elimination”. Wilson, who is chair of the joint standing committee on treaties, said Australia’s peace and security was “massively improved when we help build and enhance the framework of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament”. He said the Albanese government had “wasted no time embarking on a serious and steady re-engagement” with both the longstanding nuclear non-proliferation treaty and also the newer ban treaty. Australia attended a key meeting in Vienna in June as an observer. In a symbolic step in October, Australia changed its voting position on an annual UN resolution regarding the treaty, shifting to “abstain” after five years of “no”. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the ban treaty “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security.” That was a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. But Indonesia’s ambassador, Siswo Pramono, said Australia’s positive shift on the treaty would “give encouragement to others to believe that we are on the right path” in seeking a world free of nuclear weapons. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the UN general assembly last year that Australia would “redouble our efforts” towards disarmament because Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T18:04:05Z","webTitle":"Dam collapse a global problem as waters may poison Black Sea, Zelenskiy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the ecological disaster triggered by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam has become a global problem as severely contaminated waters flow into the Black Sea. The Ukrainian president said the flood waters raging through the lower Dnipro River valley brought with them sewage, oil, chemicals and possibly anthrax from animal burial sites. “At least two anthrax burial places are in the temporarily occupied territories,” Zelenskiy said through an interpreter in an online discussion with environmental activists. “What is happening to those sites we do not know yet.” Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam on Tuesday morning and thereby committing ecocide. As well as the 100,000 people affected downstream, Zelinskiy said 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres) of forests had been flooded, and 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. “Altogether 2 million living beings are in danger,” Zelenskiy said, warning that as the contaminated water spreads, so would the environmental devastation. “The poisoning and contamination coming from the flooding area goes to the groundwater almost immediately, poisoning rivers and then the water basin of the Black Sea,” he said. “So it’s not happening somewhere else. It is all interrelated in the world.” Zelenskiy was speaking amid growing concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, about 125 miles (200km) upstream from the dam. The plant has drawn on the Kakhova reservoir to cool its reactor cores and spent fuel, but the reservoir is now rapidly draining into the lower Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said there is no immediate risk to the plant because it has water reserves, particularly a large cooling pond. However, a report by the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has said that earlier studies suggested the dyke around the cooling pond could collapse under the pressure of the water in it if the depth of the reservoir on the other side of the dyke dipped below 10 metres. It is currently below 13 metres and falling. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs were limited and in an emergency could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou said. However, nuclear experts warned the safety of the plant would then be extremely fragile. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy corporation, said the destruction of the dam meant the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant could also be under threat of Russian sabotage. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. The relief effort on the Ukrainian-held right bank of the Dnipro continued on Thursday, as the official death toll rose to six. One person was killed and two injured as displaced people and relief workers came under artillery fire from the Russian side of the river. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy had criticised the UN and the Red Cross for failing to support the flood relief effort. On Thursday evening, he thanked international organisations for their help on the right bank but said they still had no presence in the Russian-occupied area where people were still trapped. As Ukraine struggled to contain the damage of the dam collapse on Thursday, fighting was intensifying along the frontline with Russian occupation forces. In particular, a substantial Ukrainian force, reportedly including western tanks and other equipment, appeared to be making a concerted push south of the city of Zaporizhzhia towards a Russian logistics hub in the town of Tokmak. The US press quoted unnamed US and Ukrainian officials as saying that Kyiv’s long-awaited counteroffensive had begun, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff said: “We have no such information.” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine’s hydro power corporation Ukrhydroenergo, which oversees the Kakhova dam, said the left bank would have to be liberated before reconstruction work could begin, but plans were already being drawn up in anticipation. “Water is continually flowing over it and destroying the foundation. Only when the water has calmed will we be able to see the extent of the destruction,” Syrota told the Guardian. He thought that would take 10 days. He said the next step would be to build a 15 metre-high buffer dam upstream of the ruined hydroelectric station so that work could start on building a new one. “It will take us four months to make the [buffer dam],” he said. “But we can start the work only after the liberation of this territory.” In a later interview with Ukrainian media, Syrota, said the construction time for the new buffer dam could be halved to two months “provided that we work 24/7”. Syrota dismissed suggestions that the dam could have been destroyed as result of partial damage that led to catastrophic structural failure, calling them Russian propaganda. “The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,” Syrota said. “To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.” He added: “In October 2022, the Russians kicked all the workers out of the station, and from then the facility produced no energy. It became just a fortification for the Russian military. They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined. The Russians were just waiting for right day to blow it up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/28/dominic-perrottet-matt-kean-and-the-lure-of-canberra-what-next-for-nsw-power-duo","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T14:00:50Z","webTitle":"Dominic Perrottet, Matt Kean and the lure of Canberra: what next for NSW power duo?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/28/dominic-perrottet-matt-kean-and-the-lure-of-canberra-what-next-for-nsw-power-duo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/28/dominic-perrottet-matt-kean-and-the-lure-of-canberra-what-next-for-nsw-power-duo","fields":{"bodyText":"Could Dominic Perrottet and his former treasurer Matt Kean continue their double act as the moderate-right New South Wales power duo in Canberra? Kean has made no secret of his ambition to move to federal politics and on Sunday ruled out contending for the leadership of the NSW opposition, further fuelling speculation. However, Perrottet, a sharp performer in parliament and a key figure in the NSW right, has not yet spoken of his plans, other than to say he will not contest the leadership and that he intends to spend more time with his wife and seven children, aged between 2 and 13. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It’s probably too early to speculate but the more likely direction for Perrottet, say his friends, is to follow the two previous Liberal premiers, Mike Baird and Gladys Berejiklian, into business. Baird initially went into banking after politics, but is now the chief executive of HammondCare, a provider of aged and palliative care. Berejiklian is a senior executive at Optus. As a former commercial lawyer and with four years as state treasurer, as well as more than a year as premier, Perrottet is likely to be snapped up, if and when he calls politics a day. Both men are 41. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kean has time to work the numbers for a tilt at a federal seat, since the next federal election is not expected until 2025. Bradfield, which overlaps with Kean’s state seat of Hornsby, would be the easiest entry point, though Kean has apparently told friends he would consider running in a teal-held seat like North Sydney, previously held by his friend and fellow moderate Trent Zimmerman. The MP for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher, who is the manager of opposition business and a member of the moderate faction, was asked repeatedly whether he would run again. “I think any rational person would say exactly the same thing. I’ve considered my position before previous elections, but if you ask me, am I committed to serving the people of Bradfield? I’m absolutely committed to serving the people of Bradfield,” he told Patricia Karvelas on the ABC’s Radio National. There has also been speculation that Liberal MP Alex Hawke’s days are numbered in the seat of Mitchell. The local branches are now controlled by the hard-right faction, while Hawke is the leading figure of the centre-right. There is no love lost between the two factions, particularly after Hawke was blamed for holding up preselections for last year’s federal election in order to shore up the centre right’s position, a move that some in the party said contributed to the Liberal party’s loss. Hawke did not return the Guardian’s calls. Mitchell covers Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, Winston Hills, parts of Northmead and North Rocks in the south, along with new housing estates around Kellyville and Rouse Hill. Intriguingly, Perrottet grew up in the area and was previously the member for Castle Hill, then Hawkesbury, then Epping. His earlier seats overlap with Mitchell. Those close to Perrottet say his wife, Helen, had ruled out a move to federal politics because of the difficulties it would pose for the family. But a week is a long time in politics. A third former NSW minister, Victor Dominello, could also be Canberra bound, but not as an elected representative. The minister for government services, Bill Shorten, has sounded out Dominello for a possible role assisting with digital delivery of government services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T17:14:03Z","webTitle":"US reportedly held talks with Russia on nuclear risk in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has reportedly held talks with aides to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, with the aim of reducing the risk that the war in Ukraine could spill over or escalate into a nuclear conflict. The Wall Street Journal said the senior White House figure had held confidential conversations in recent months with the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and Russian security council secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan’s counterpart, that were not made public. Neither Washington or Moscow has confirmed if the talks took place and the report did not detail the time or dates of the phone calls. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the report at his daily briefing. “Once again I repeat that there are some truthful reports, but for the most part there are reports that are pure speculation,” he told reporters. In September, Russia started ratcheting up the idea that it may use nuclear weapons as it set the stage for the illegal annexation of parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, saying Ukrainian attacks on them would be considered a threat to Russia’s national security, which would be defended against using all available means. Sullivan warned that month that any use of nuclear weapons by the Kremlin would have “catastrophic consequences for Russia”, which the US had “spelled out” in private conversations with Russian officials, he told NBC. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington DC-based thinktank, noted last week that Russia had notably softened its nuclear rhetoric since early November. Russia’s foreign ministry issued a statement on 2 November about “the inadmissibility of a nuclear war in which there can be no winners” and said it was committed to reducing nuclear weapons. Putin went so far as to claim Russia had never discussed the possibility of using nuclear weapons. Shortly before what the west called sham referendums in parts of Ukraine Russia had said it intended to annex, Putin claimed without evidence that the west had threaten to use nuclear weapons against Russia. “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we, of course, will use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,” said Putin. “This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.” More recently, Russia had made claims, without providing evidence, that Kyiv was preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb. Ukraine said it feared that Russia was preparing a false-flag nuclear attack, which it would then blame on Kyiv. Throughout the war, the US has had the tricky task of supporting Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, while maintaining some distance to avoid giving cause for escalation. For this reason, the US and other key western allies of Ukraine, such as the UK, have ruled out putting boots on the ground or establishing a no-fly zone that could put Nato and Russian forces into direct conflict. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in late October that it was important to keep channels of communication open with Russia to “manage escalation”, specifying his main concern was Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, but did not say if or how often such channels were being used. “We’re going to continue to communicate that any type of use of a weapon of that sort, or even the talk of the use of a weapon of that sort, is dangerous and irresponsible,” said Austin. Though nuclear tensions appear to have subsided for now, the ISW said Russia may return to nuclear brinkmanship again to prompt the west to pressure Ukraine into negotiating. Russia is trying to regain the advantage in Ukraine after a series of retreats in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. So far, its strategy, it seems, is to disable Ukraine in the rear by cutting off its power supplies over winter, while using its newly mobilised troops to gain and regain ground on the frontlines. Ukraine’s western allies reportedly envisage negotiations beginning after Ukraine has retaken the Kherson region, so that Kyiv will start from a point of strength, Italy’s La Republicca reported on Monday. On Saturday, the Washington Post said that the US was urging Kyiv to be more open to talks amid worries from allies in parts of Europe, Africa and Latin America of a protracted war with devastating economic effects. A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Monday that Kyiv had never refused to negotiate with Moscow, but restated it would not hold talks while Vladimir Putin was in power. “Ukraine has never refused to negotiate. Our negotiating position is known and open,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying that Russia should first withdraw its troops from Ukraine. “Is Putin ready? Obviously not. Therefore, we are constructive in our assessment: we will talk with the next leader.” On Monday, Peskov said Russia was open to talks but it was Ukraine that was refusing. Both Ukraine and the US, its main western ally, say Russia has yet to show it is serious about negotiations, pointing to Russia’s recent mobilisation drive, rerouting of its economy for the war effort, the illegal annexation of more Ukrainian territory and the accompanying nuclear rhetoric. In his nightly address on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was vital to oblige Russia to participate in “genuine” peace talks, describing the country as a destabilising force on a range of issues, including climate change. He decried “Russia’s destabilising influence” as the world confronted war, energy and food crises, and what he called the destruction of customary international relations. The climate agenda, he said, was “really suffering” but could not be “put on hold”. “So anyone serious about the climate agenda must also be serious about the need to immediately stop Russian aggression, restore our territorial integrity, and force Russia into genuine peace negotiations,” Zelenskiy said. Despite its struggle to make headway on the battlefield, Russia has had significant success in striking Ukraine’s energy sector thanks to Iranian-supplied drones, which are reportedly making up for its rapidly depleting stockpiles of missiles and rockets. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has told residents to prepare for longer cuts and make arrangements to leave the city in the event of a total blackout. Obtaining additional air defence systems and ammunition has become Kyiv’s number one priority in recent weeks. Last week, Germany sent an Iris-T system and on Monday, Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksiy Reznikov, welcomed Nasams and Aspide air defence systems, thanking Norway, Spain and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/20/they-keep-coming-back-a-black-town-in-arizona-battles-power-expansion-plans-again","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-20T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"‘They keep coming back’: a Black community in Arizona battles power expansion plans again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/20/they-keep-coming-back-a-black-town-in-arizona-battles-power-expansion-plans-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/20/they-keep-coming-back-a-black-town-in-arizona-battles-power-expansion-plans-again","fields":{"bodyText":"A handful of weary residents gathered at the windowless Randolph church to mull over the latest effort by an electric utility to expand its power station – a polluting gas-fired plant next door to the community that the state regulator has blocked on environmental and health grounds. Randolph is a historic Black community in central Arizona flanked by railroads and heavy hazardous industries, a small dusty place where residents are exposed to some of the worst air quality in the state while lacking basic amenities like fire hydrants, trash collection and healthcare. Last year, the community celebrated a historic win when the state regulator rejected a proposal by the public utility Salt River Project (SRP) to more than double the size of its power plant, ruling that it would cause further harm to Randolph residents and was not in the public interest. It was major victory for clean energy and environmental justice in Arizona, according to the Sierra Club, the environmental group which condemned the proposed expansion as “textbook environmental racism”. But SRP has refused to take no for an answer, and residents fear that the state regulator might reverse its decision. “We won, they lost, but they won’t accept it and keep coming back. This is not democratic,” said Ron Jordan, 77, whose family has lived in Randolph since in the 1930s. “They are dangling goodies in front of us, but the community doesn’t want it, we already have too much pollution. This isn’t right.” At a recent community meeting held at the modest church, SRP offered to finance a new community centre, air quality monitoring and $50,000 in landscaping and signage among other projects if residents dropped their opposition to power plant expansion. “We’re not giving up no matter what they offer,” said Guadalupe Felix, 45, whose family have lived in Randolph for three generations. “This plant is going to kill us, we’re already suffocating.” The community says it won’t back down, but nationwide utilities have a track record of getting what they want, according to David Pomerantz, director of the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI). “Refusing to take no for an answer is incredibly common.” * * * Randolph is an unincorporated town in Pinal county first settled in the 1920s and 30s by mostly Black families from Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas who came to pick cotton in the Gila River valley. It was one of the only places Black families could buy property, and by the 1960s the close-knit agricultural community, which was also home to Mexicans and Native Americans, boasted thriving stores, bars, churches and gas stations. Mechanization of the cotton industry led to the community’s economic and population decline, after which the nearby town of Coolidge began annexing the land around Randolph and converted it into an industrial area. Today, only 150 or so residents live in an area the equivalent of seven football fields long by three fields wide, some in houses or plots purchased by their ancestors. There’s no store, no bar, no gas station and no park, just the church with a single lofty palm for shade. The agricultural fields and desert plains where children would ride their bikes and chase roadrunners are long gone, and Randolph is now virtually surrounded by polluting infrastructure including gas plants, pipelines, a hazardous waste site and a steel company contracted to manufacture Donald’s Trump’s border wall. The community is literally surrounded by cumulative and acute hazards. Pinal county has some of the worst air pollution in Arizona, according to the American Lung Association and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is also bearing the brunt of the climate crisis with farmers forced to leave fields fallow or sell them off, many to solar farms, due to ongoing drought and water shortages. In August 2021, a gas pipeline explosion threw Randolph residents out of bed, igniting a huge fireball that killed farm worker Luis Alvarez and his 14-year-old daughter Valeria. Part of the problem is the gas-fired power station, which lights up at night, hums like an airport, and spews out toxins and greenhouse gases from a dozen towering stacks. SRP purchased the plant in 2019, and two years later sought environmental approval from the Arizona corporation commission (ACC) for an almost a billion-dollar 820MW expansion. The ACC is the state utility regulator responsible for approving SRP’s power plants and transmission lines, as well as rate hikes and new energy projects for private energy, water and telecommunication utilities. Every state has a version of the ACC, most commonly referred to as a public utilities commission (PUC). As the community, the Sierra Club and others organised against the plant expansion, SRP announced plans to help finance road paving, landscaping projects and a scholarships and job training program, as well as an attempt to get Randolph recognised as a national historic place. In April 2022, the ACC rejected SRP’s expansion plan after concluding that the power company had failed to consider viable green energy alternatives such as solar and battery storage before pursuing the power plant expansion – which would worsen air quality especially for Randolph residents who live next door. (The commission rejected a recommendation by its power plant and line siting committee to grant the environmental certificate.) SRP requested a new hearing, which the ACC denied. The utility then filed – and lost – a lawsuit at the Maricopa county superior court. “The [ACC] determined that the need for the proposed project is outweighed by its environmental impact. SRP has not shown that decision to be unlawful or unreasonable,” the court ruled in January 2023. SRP still wouldn’t take no for an answer, and has since petitioned the state supreme court to hear the case, and persuaded the ACC to reopen discussion on the expansion. “SRP is used to getting its way, and it’s pushing on all fronts. The ACC has a huge impact in people’s lives, but the process wears communities down, it’s never over,” said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon chapter. “It’s heartbreaking for the Randolph folks who finally felt that their voices had been heard.” Regulating utilities and influencing regulators The ACC, Arizona’s version of a PUC, was established in the state constitution and, unlike PUCs in other states, it is also responsible for railroad and pipeline safety, incorporating businesses and regulating securities. In most states, PUC commissioners are appointed by the governor, but in a quarter of states, including Arizona, the commissioners are elected directly by voters. “Utilities typically try to get a new decision from a PUC when they don’t like the original one about a rate hike or a new gas plant. They will wait it out [for new commissioners] or try to circumvent the commission altogether if they think the legislature will be friendlier to their cause,” said Pomerantz of the EPI. Last year, Indiana’s PUC, the utility regulatory commission, approved two new gas plants – three years after rejecting the power company’s initial proposal for failing to adequately consider renewables. In Virginia, state lawmakers who have received substantial donations from Dominion Energy, which also spends big in Washington, recently attempted to pass legislation to increase the company’s authorised profit margin despite households struggling to pay their bills. Utilities spend big on state politics and in the 2020 election cycle, investor-owned energy utilities contributed almost $12m to influential political organisations such as the Republican and Democrat governor and attorney general associations, according to an EPI analysis. To get what they want from Congress, electric utilities spent $347m on lobbying Washington in the past three years, including $3.4m by SRP affiliates, according to Open Secrets. Utilities are known to have directed large sums to influence campaigns in states with elected commissioners including Georgia, Louisiana and Arizona. In Arizona, the ACC is the primary governmental body for tackling the climate crisis. In 2006, it established an energy standard that mandated utilities to generate at least 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. The ACC is among just a handful of partisan utility regulators, and four of the current five commissioners – including the two new members elected in January – are Republicans. Kevin Thompson, who for 17 years worked for the state’s largest gas utility, and Nick Myers are both outspoken critics of the clean energy mandate. Shortly after the superior court judge sided with the ACC’s original decision blocking the plant expansion, the reconstituted commission allowed SRP to remake its case and voted unanimously to restart discussions with the power company. Since then, the SRP has provided Randolph residents with a list of possible community investments and concessions should the expansion be approved. “This is a classic case of systemic racism, one of many communities across the country where companies with money and power will go to any extreme to get what they want,” said Constance Jackson, the NAACP’s Pinal county branch president. “It’s sad the community has to go through this again because the decision was made. It should not be back on the ACC agenda.” JP Martin, an ACC spokesperson, said: “There is a drastic misunderstanding that the SRP extension in Coolidge is on any agenda. The commission’s legal division is engaging with SRP’s legal team – that is all that is currently known.” A utility spokesperson said: “SRP continues to believe that the ACC’s line siting committee, which heard all the testimony, toured the plant and toured the Randolph community, was correct when it approved the proposed expansion … The Coolidge expansion project would be required to comply with an air quality permit that restricts the emissions from the plant to levels that are protective of human health and the environment. The project also aligns with our commitment to clean energy and the transformation of the grid. “SRP continues to seek a collaborative solution with the Randolph community that would provide a way forward and we are committed to continuing to grow our relationship and partnership with the community.” In Randolph, residents are weary but not defeated. “I know it doesn’t look like it now, but Randolph was a great place to grow up. This is our history and we are the voices of our ancestors, so this place is priceless to me,” said Kyle Muldrow, 53, an army veteran and fourth generation resident. “The ACC made its decision, this should be over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:47:32Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: International Atomic Energy Agency raises grave concerns over shelling at nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"This blog is closing now, thanks for following the day’s developments. All our Ukraine news is here Here is a summary of events today: Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday on a three-nation visit with a reported aim of countering Russian influence on the continent. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain visited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv today. On Telegram Zelenskiy thanked her for meeting with him adding, such visits are “extremely valuable” for helping the world “hear, know and understand” what is happening in Ukraine. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain has met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Writing on Telegram, the president said: American actress Jessica Chastain is in Ukraine today. For us, such visits of famous people are extremely valuable. Thanks to this, the world will hear, know and understand the truth about what is happening in our country even more. Thanks for the support! Chastain also visited the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, according to Ukrainian public broadcaster, Suspilne News. Here are some images coming over the wires today. The Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine is a focus of attention in the war after Kyiv accused Russia of shelling the plant again and damaging radiation sensors. The plant, in Russian-controlled territory, was also shelled on Friday. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes. Reuters has put together some facts about Europe’s largest nuclear facility. Zaporizhzhia is the largest of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, which together provide about half the country’s electricity. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February was the first time war has broken out in a country with such a large and established nuclear power programme, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says. Zaporizhzhia’s six units each have a net capacity of 950 Megawatts electric, or a total of 5.7 Gigawatts electric, according to an IAEA database. The first unit was connected to the grid in 1984, and the last in 1995. The plant is of strategic importance to Russia because it is only about 200 km (125 miles) from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The plant was captured by Russian forces in the opening stage of the war but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the facility on Friday, prompting its operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. Ukrainian emergency services have released drone footage of a burning building in Mykolaiv, after what authorities say was a Russian strike. Mykolaiv borders the mostly Russian-occupied Kherson region. A medical facility in the southern port city was recently damaged in a Russian attack, which Mykolaiv’s mayor described as ‘terrorism’ Key developments today so far. Ukraine and Russia blamed each other on Sunday for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes.Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher.” Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant, which is in Russian-controlled territory and was also shelled on Friday. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs.The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the ships carrying grain saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians, which infuriated president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation if its Kyiv office head, Reuters reports. The report, published on Thursday, said the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit reportedly aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s February invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor has told Reuters. Of those charged, about 15 were in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remained at large, Yuriy Bilousov, head of the war crimes department of the prosecutor general’s office, said in an interview in the capital, Kyiv. Thirteen cases had been submitted to courts and seven verdicts issued, he said. In May, a 21-year-old captured Russian soldier became the first person to be convicted in a war crimes trial in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. He was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian. “Sometimes we’ve been asked why we prosecute such ... low-ranked officers. It’s just because they are physically here ... If generals were here physically and we were able to capture [them], we would definitely prosecute generals,” Reuters reported Bilousov as saying. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presents orders and the other state awards to service personnel and to members of the families of fallen soldiers in Kyiv on Sunday on the Air Force of Ukraine Day. Ukraine and Russia are pointing the finger at each other for shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for a stronger international response to fresh shelling at the plant, reportedly by Russian forces, Russian occupation authorities claimed on Sunday a strike reportedly by Ukrainian forces had damaged administrative buildings inside the complex, AFP reports. Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s largest atomic power complex that was occupied by Russia early in its offensive – has in recent days been the scene of military strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor. On Sunday, Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher,” AFP reports. “The projectiles fell within 400 metres of a working reactor,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted them as saying. The strike damaged some administrative buildings and fell in a “zone storing used nuclear fuel”. The information could not be independently verified. As Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the attacks, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned on Saturday of “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Amnesty International apologised on Sunday for “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians which infuriated President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation of its Kviy office head. The rights group published the report on Thursday saying the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion, Reuters reports. “Amnesty International deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” it said in an email to Reuters. “Amnesty International’s priority in this and in any conflict is ensuring that civilians are protected. Indeed, this was our sole objective when releasing this latest piece of research. While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused.” Zelenskiy accused the group of trying to shift responsibility from Russian aggression, while Amnesty’s Ukraine head, Oksana Pokalchuk, quit, saying the report was a propaganda gift for Moscow. Ukrainian officials say they try to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, has not commented on the rights report. In its email on Sunday, Amnesty said it had found Ukrainian forces next to civilian residences in 19 towns and villages it visited, exposing them to risk of incoming Russian fire. “This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,” it said. “We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations.” Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the first ships carrying grain previously blockaded by Russia, saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. At his weekly address to pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday, Pope Francis said: This step shows that it is possible to conduct dialogue to reach concrete results, which help everyone. This event presents itself as a sign of hope and my own heartfelt wish is that following this path, it will be possible to bring an end to the fighting and reach a just and lasting peace. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for stronger international response to Russia’s “nuclear terror” after reported new shelling at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear power plant. During a phone call with the European Council president, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy called for sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Twitter. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace today welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. More details about the training programme can be found in this report from last month. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said on Sunday that a worker was wounded when Russian forces again reportedly shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. It said on Telegram that the site of the plant’s dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel are stored in the open air, was hit by rocket attacks. Here is the UK’s Ministry of Defence latest intelligence update on Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent, AFP reports. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. South Africa has remained neutral in the Ukraine war, refusing to join Western calls to condemn Moscow, which had opposed apartheid before the end of white minority rule in 1994. Blinken will hold talks on Monday with his South African counterpart, Naledi Pandor, and also make an announcement on the US government’s new Africa strategy, Pretoria said in a statement. They will “discuss ongoing and recent developments relating to the global geopolitical situation,” it said. The state department last month called African countries “geostrategic players and critical partners on the most pressing issues of our day, from promoting an open and stable international system, to tackling the effects of climate change, food insecurity and global pandemics to shaping our technological and economic futures”. Blinken who is on his second trip to Africa since his appointment early last year, is due to proceed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda later this week. This analysis by the Guardian’s Africa correspondent Jason Burke of Lavrov’s tour gives a good insight into the battle for influence on the African continent.

They included Glory, with a cargo of 66,000 tonnes of corn bound for Istanbul, and Riva Wind, loaded with 44,000 tonnes of corn, heading for Turkey’s Iskenderun, the Turkish defence ministry said. It said the other two vessels to have left Ukraine were Star Helena, with a cargo of 45,000 tonnes of meal heading to China, and Mustafa Necati, carrying 6,000 tonnes of sunflower oil and heading for Italy, Reuters reports. The JCC also said it was near finalisation of the shipping procedures to regularise operations to support implementation of the grain deal. The procedures were expected to be published early this week, it said. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement. The JCC said it has also authorized the movement, pending inspection, of Osprey S, inbound for Chornomorsk. That ship is currently at anchorage northwest of Istanbul and was to be inspected on Sunday. On Saturday, the JCC completed the inspection of Navistar, which was cleared to sail, and its joint inspection teams were to continue inspections on Sunday morning of the remaining two vessels that departed Ukrainian ports on Friday. The first ship to leave a Ukrainian port under the deal will not arrive in Lebanon on Sunday as planned, the Ukrainian embassy in Lebanon said. The Razoni left Odesa last Monday carrying 26,527 tonnes of corn. The embassy told Reuters the ship was “having a delay” and “not arriving today,” with no details on a new arrival date or the cause of the delay. Shipping data on MarineTraffic.com showed the Razoni off the Turkish coast on Sunday morning. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Ukraine’s Kherson region has died after an assassination attempt, local Moscow-backed authorities as saying.. Vitaly Gura, the deputy chief of the Kakhovka district, “died of his injuries”, local official Katerina Gubareva, said on Telegram, AFP reports. Gura was attacked at home on Saturday morning and was gravely wounded by bullets, a source in the Russian-backed administration is reported to have told TASS news agency. Kakhovka is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Kherson city. Several assassination attempts have been reported against officials in Ukrainian regions seized by Russia since the start of its military operation in Ukraine in February. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports, Ukrainian and Turkish officials said. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs, Reuters reports. The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the deal last month after UN warnings of possible outbreaks of famine in parts of the world due to a halt in grain shipments from Ukraine that had squeezed supplies and sent prices soaring. Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The JCC has authorised the departure of a total of five new vessels through the Black Sea corridor: four vessels outbound from Chornomorsk and Odesa carrying 161,084 metric tonnes of foodstuffs, and one inbound. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Reuters could not verify either side’s assertions about battlefield developments. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday said that over the past week its forces had “achieved powerful results” in destroying Russia’s logistics supplies and rear bases. He said in a late night address: “Every strike on the enemy’s ammunition depots, on their command posts, and on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians. Reuters also reports: Russia’s war in Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with most fighting shifting to a nearly 350-km (217-mile) front stretching southwest from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, British military intelligence said. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine to help fend off Moscow’s ongoing invasion, senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. The next weapons package to Ukraine from the United States was expected to be $1 billion and include munitions for long-range weapons and armoured medical transport vehicles, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. More on the Zaporizhzhia power plant Reuters reports: Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the plant, prompting operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. The plant was captured by Russian forces in early March, but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom blamed Russia for the damage at the power plant. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. The United States has accused Russia of using it as a “nuclear shield” while Russia’s defence ministry said damage to the plant had only been avoided thanks to the “skilful, competent and effective actions” of its units. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Saturday: I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster,” Both sides have accused each other of engaging in “nuclear terrorism”. Read more here: Good morning and welcome to the blog, where we start with a round-up of the latest developments. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was a rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of the Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement with it after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started and will be loaded with grain, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister said.

The state government’s police powers and responsibilities and other legislation amendment bill would give adults caught carrying small quantities of illicit substances three chances before facing a criminal charge. Police officers would be forced to consider diversionary options for children but they would still be subject to police discretion under the new law, as revealed by Guardian Australia earlier this month. Bree Callanan, a senior lawyer at the QHRC, said the proposed laws were “a breach of the fundamental principle that children in the justice system should not be treated more harshly than adults”. At a parliamentary inquiry into the laws, Callanan said the measures were “at odds” with youth justice principles and a child’s entitlement to protection under the state’s Human Rights Act. This includes for laws to be in their best interests and for children to be treated without discrimination, she said. “We recommend [the legislation] … be amended so that a … child must receive a drug diversion warning … unless another diversionary option is taken under the Youth Justice Act,” Callanan told the public hearing on Monday. The chief executive officer of the Youth Advocacy Centre, Katherine Hayes, said the proposed laws would entrench children in the criminal justice system. Hayes said this was due to legislation introducing a new tougher sentencing regime for “serious repeat offenders” that was passed by the state government last week. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Children … are more likely to enter custody, which doesn’t effectively address the underlying causes of their use of the substances in the first place,” Hayes said. “This also will contribute to the overcrowding of detention centres and watch houses because of their cumulative effect, which is likely to occur in the coming months.” The Queensland police (QPS) said they supported the government’s approach in their response to submissions to the bill. They claimed that “applying the framework in a mandatory way to children would constrain the ability of police officers to use the existing diversionary options in section 11 of the [Youth Justice Act]”. “For that reason, the bill makes the use of drug diversion warnings and drug diversion assessment programs, in relation to children, discretionary,” QPS said. QPS also noted that the children’s court has the discretion to dismiss charges under the Youth Justice Act if they believe “police should have initiated a diversionary option rather than charging a child”. But the chair of children’s law at the Queensland Law Society, Damian Bartholomew, said while the court does have this discretionary power, children would still be disadvantaged as it would form part of their court history. “That will be quite different to what would be having to an adult in the equivalent situation where under this legislation they would be diverted and the matter would not be presented on their court history,” he told the hearing. It comes as the QHRC also expressed concern over a provision in the bill that would strengthen the drug trafficking offence from 25 years to life in prison, with Callanan dubbing it a “significant limitation on the right to liberty.” The commission also called for there to be no limitations on the number of warnings or diversionary measures that police can issue for a drug offence “unless there is evidence of commerciality”. The QHRC said they otherwise supported the bill and its commitment to a “harm reduction and health-based approach” to personal drug use and possession. The Queensland Mental Health Commission and Alcohol and Drug Foundation also backed the bill and said they hoped it could be a first step towards decriminalisation. Queensland’s mental health commissioner, Ivan Frkovic, said the bill was “an important development in drug law reform in Queensland” that has the potential to “alleviate demands on the justice system” and “achieve positive outcomes for people who use drugs, their families and the broader community”. The state manager at the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, Martin Milne, said 80-90% of illicit drug users are not dependent on drugs and for these people a criminal response does more harm than good. “On the other hand, for those who are dependent on illicit drugs criminalisation is also an ineffective and harmful response,” Milne said. “People who are most dependent on substances need effective health interventions rather than experiencing further harm from the criminal justice system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/02/bolsonaro-allegedly-attended-meetings-coup-plot-senator","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T18:52:49Z","webTitle":"Bolsonaro attended meeting about plot to keep him in power, senator says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/bolsonaro-allegedly-attended-meetings-coup-plot-senator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/02/bolsonaro-allegedly-attended-meetings-coup-plot-senator","fields":{"bodyText":"A close ally of Jair Bolsonaro has turned against Brazil’s former president, claiming that an aide to the far-right leader tried to “coerce” him into joining a conspiracy to annul the October elections and keep Bolsonaro in power. Senator Marcos do Val claimed at a news conference on Thursday that he was invited to a meeting on 9 December with the then president by a fellow member of congress, Daniel Silveira, to discuss a plan to “save Brazil” . At the meeting, Silveira allegedly asked Do Val to try to induce the country’s top electoral authority, the supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes, into making compromising comments in a taped telephone conversation. The recording would then be used to have De Moraes arrested, and prevent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from taking over as president on 1 January, Do Val claimed. Bolsonaro “sat in silence” while Silveira laid out the plot, said Do Val, who claimed that he had refused to join the conspiracy. The explosive allegations came as Silveira was arrested in the state of Rio de Janeiro on Thursday morning on De Moraes’s orders, having lost his parliamentary immunity with the end of his term a day earlier. De Moraes accuses Silveira, a hardcore Bolsonaro supporter who has previously been detained for threatening the electoral officials, of disobeying court orders and “complete disrespect and mockery” of the judiciary. De Moraes has ordered Do Val to testify before federal police within five days as part of the investigation into the former president’s alleged attempt to subvert democracy, Reuters reported. Do Val’s allegations add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that Bolsonaro sought to overturn the results of the October elections, which Lula won by a slim margin. Bolsonaro has still not officially conceded. These attempts seemingly culminated in the 8 January attack on the capital, Brasília, in which thousands of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked government buildings in what is being treated as an attempted power grab. In the days following the insurrection, police found a draft decree in the house of Anderson Torres, Bolsonaro’s former justice minister and the Brasília security chief at the time of the attacks. Analysts say the document could have been used to pave the way for a military coup. Torres is under arrest and due to give evidence to the police on Thursday. Bolsonaro himself is being investigated as a possible “intellectual author” of the attacks, while authorities are also scrutinising the role of the security forces, amid widespread evidence of collusion with the 8 January rioters. Do Val initially made the allegations during a Instagram live on Wednesday night, and an account of the alleged plot was published by the rightwing magazine Veja on Thursday, before Do Val gave his press conference. Under the headline “Indecent Proposal” Veja reported that Bolsonaro told Do Val that the national intelligence agency and presidential security cabinet were on board with the plan to entrap De Moraes. Do Val gave a different account at the press conference on Thursday, saying that Silveira did all the talking in the meeting and that there was no mention of the two security agencies. A military officer and trainer of elite security teams with a strong social media presence, Do Val was elected for an eight-year term as senator in 2018 riding the conservative wave that brought Bolsonaro to power. He was a staunch ally of the previous government in congress. Following his allegations on Wednesday night, he said on social media that he planned to “definitively” leave politics. Do Val is so far the closest Bolsonaro ally to have turned against the former president – a sign of his growing isolation. The far-right leader is holed up in Orlando, having fled to the US before Lula’s inauguration, and recently applied for a six-month tourist visa. At a fundraising event in Florida on Wednesday, Bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters that he plans to remain involved in Brazilian politics. According to political commentators in Brazil, however, members of his Liberal party believe he has lost any chance of trying to return to the presidency at the next election, in 2026. In a further indication of Bolsonaro’s diminished political clout, his candidate for the senate presidency, Rogério Marinho, lost to the Lula-backed Rodrigo Pacheco in an internal election on Wednesday. Police plan to take Do Val’s testimony as part of their investigations into the 8 January insurrection. Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president’s eldest son, said in congress on Thursday that the meeting described by Do Val “does not constitute any type of crime”. In a statement later, Flávio Bolsonaro said there was never any coup attempt and that his father is a “defender of law and order and has always played within the four lines of the Constitution.” During the inaugural session of the supreme court on Wednesday, Chief Justice Rosa Weber said:“[This court’s values] will never be touched or crushed by barbarity, and nor will its judges be intimidated by barbarity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T15:42:52Z","webTitle":"The power of speech in Ambridge | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","fields":{"bodyText":"Fear not, George Grundy in fact said “back off” not “buck off” (or anything worse) in last Friday’s episode of The Archers (Letters, 23 August).

Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Authorities updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry updated the number of Russian casualties to at least 44,300. Meanwhile, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths and found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces are preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. Russia’s foreign ministry rejected a proposal by UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to demilitarise the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it would make the facility “more vulnerable”, Reuters reports. The inhabitants of two villages in southern Russia near the Ukrainian border were evacuated on Thursday after a nearby ammunition storage depot caught fire but no one was hurt, an official said. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod region, said in a statement that emergency services were investigating the cause of the fire near the settlements of Timonovo and Soloti, 15km (9 miles) from Ukraine, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian news website posted a video it said showed a large ball of flame erupting from the base. Russia on Tuesday blamed saboteurs for orchestrating a series of explosions at an ammunition depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, further to the south. Authorities have updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. “Last night was one of the most tragic of the entire war in the Kharkiv region,” local governor Oleh Synehubov wrote on Telegram. During the meeting today in Lviv between the leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, the families of soldiers from the Azov regiment marched across the city, calling for the return of their loved ones. A number of soldiers from this regiment are being held by Russia since they surrendered in mid-May the Mariupol steel plant they had been defending for weeks. The families called for Russia to follow the Geneva convention on treatment of prisoners of war and provide their loved ones with what they need. Earlier this month, Russia’s supreme court on declared the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation, a designation that could lead to terror charges against some of the captured fighters. The regiment has been a key piece of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the alleged goal of “denazification”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. However, since then, its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins, with the unit integrating into the Ukrainian national guard. “While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said today. Erdoğan met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, in Lviv today to discuss, among other things, the deal to unblock the Ukraine’s ports that was brokered by the UN and Turkey. The three leaders also spoke urgently about the rising tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with Erdoğan warning of the danger of “another Chernobyl” disaster, Agence France-Presse is reporting. “We are worried. We do not want another Chernobyl,” said Erdoğan. Erdoğan mentioned Vladimir Putin once in his comments to reporters. “We discussed the exchange of prisoners of war and our initiatives in this regard,” he said. “We will continue to talk about that with Mr Putin.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has signed an agreement with Ukraine to help reconstruct infrastructure destroyed by the Russian invasion. Erdoğan is in Lviv today meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and UN chief António Guterres. Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, met in Lviv today to discuss the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s ports and the increasing tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In the meeting, leaders agreed upon the parameters of a possible mission led by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the power plant, which is the largest reactor in Europe. Zelenskiy told Guterres that this “deliberate and cynical terror on the part of the aggressor could have catastrophic consequences for Ukraine and the whole world”, according to a statement released by the office of the president. They agreed that an IAEA mission “must be carried out in a legal way through a territory free from occupiers”. Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv blames Russian forces. During the meeting, Guterres also told Zelenskiy of a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, “where Russia committed a cynical terrorist attack against Ukrainian prisoners of war,” the statement reads. Zelenskiy asked Guterres also to investigate “the issue of compliance by the Russian side with the agreements reached in the context of the withdrawal of Ukrainian defenders from Azovstal”. Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Kyiv has accused Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – Kyiv says it is Russian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN met in Lviv today to review the grain export deal and discuss the growing tensions around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Here are some photos of the visit: After meeting the UN secretary general, Antònio Guterres, in Lviv today, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the United Nations must ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant occupied by Russian forces, Reuters is reporting. On Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote that he and Guterres had discussed the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s blockaded ports and ease a worsening global food crisis, but “particular attention was paid to the topic of Russia’s nuclear blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP”. “This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,” Zelenskiy wrote. “Therefore, the UN must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarisation and complete liberation from Russian troops.” Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv says it is Russian forces who have shelled the facility. Today, Russia said it could shut down the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, after it came under shelling at the frontlines in Ukraine. Kyiv has since denounced the move as a risk that would increase nuclear catastrophe. Zelenskiy noted that he and Guterres also “agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation.” “We also discussed the possible directions of its development, the issue of illegal and forced deportation of Ukrainians, the release of our military personnel and medics from captivity,” he said. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet in Lviv to review the grain export deal. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. With tensions continuing to rise around the plant, scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster. Scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, was hit hard over the course of 12 hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry updated the number of Russian casualties to at least 44,300.

Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths and found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine, the Associated Press is reporting. Three MiG-31 fighters with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles arrived at the Chkalovsk airbase in the Baltic Sea enclave south of Lithuania as part of “additional measures of strategic deterrence”, Russia’s defence ministry said. The warplanes will be put on round-the-clock alert, according to the ministry. The Kinzhal has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept, the Russian military said. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. A video released by the ministry showed the fighters arriving at the base but not carrying the missiles. The deployment of Kinzhal missiles to Kaliningrad was an apparent showcasing of the Russian military’s capability to threaten Nato assets – Kaliningrad borders Nato members Poland and Lithuania. It comes after Moscow strongly criticised the deliveries of western weapons to Ukraine, accusing the US and its allies of fuelling the conflict. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, has been hit hard over the past few hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Here is footage: The 25th cargo ship carrying grain has departed Ukraine under a deal with Russia brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to unblock the country’s blockaded ports, Agence France-Presse is reporting. The ship, which is expected to reach Egypt in a few days, departed as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and UN chief António Guterres, who were key to the reaching of the accord, were convening in Lviv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The cargo ship I Maria departed from the port of Chornomorsk. It is loaded with 33,000 tonnes of corn,” Ukraine’s ports authority said in a statement on social media. It said that 600,000 tones of Ukrainian agricultural products had been shipped through a corridor agreed by Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul last month. “So far, 25 ships with Ukrainian products left the ports of Odessa, Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk for the Bosphorus strait,” the ports authority added. The grain agreement lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors through the naval mines laid by Kyiv, with the first commercial ship carrying grain leaving on 1 August. With Ukraine and Russia two of the world’s biggest grain exporters, the halt in exports caused grain prices to soar, fuelling fears of a rise in global food shortages, particularly in poor countries already experiencing shortfalls. With tensions continuing to rise around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster at the plant. The scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. “What the fuck do we need this war for?” Pavel Filatyev, a Russian soldier who fought in Ukraine, has fled his homeland and is risking prison to speak out against the invasion. The ex-paratrooper has published a 141-page bombshell breaking down the day-to-day activities of his unit after they were sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea and eventually entered and captured Kherson. “I simply can’t stay quiet any longer, even though I know that I probably won’t change anything, and maybe I’ve acted foolishly to get myself in so much trouble,” said Filatyev, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette. His memoir, ZOV, detailed how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine with no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said. At one point, Filatyev describes how the ravenous paratroopers, the elite of the Russian army, captured the Kherson seaport and immediately began grabbing “computers and whatever valuable goods we could find”. Then they ransacked the kitchens for food. “Like savages, we ate everything there: oats, porridge, jam, honey, coffee … We didn’t give a damn about anything, we’d already been pushed to the limit. Most had spent a month in the fields with no hint of comfort, a shower or normal food. “What a wild state you can drive people to by not giving any thought to the fact that they need to sleep, eat and wash,” he wrote. “Everything around gave us a vile feeling; like wretches we were just trying to survive.” Read more here: While Ukraine’s foreign ministry has the number of Russian casualties at about 44,300, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths (Russia’s defence ministry disclosed casualties only twice in March, acknowledging just 1,849 personnel killed). Looking into these deaths, Mediazona found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has provided an updated intelligence report on Russian troop locations and movement in Ukraine: Russian shells have again struck Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, yesterday and early this morning. In the attack this morning, at least one person was killed and 18 others injured, while seven were killed and 16 wounded on Wednesday. Here is a look at the destruction left behind: Ukraine’s foreign ministry has posted an update on Russia’s losses since the start of the invasion. According to the ministry, at least 44,300 Russian soldiers have been killed. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. Russian hacker group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said blocked access to more than 200 state and private Estonian institutions. The Estonian government said the impact of the attack was limited and went “largely unnoticed”. “Yesterday, Estonia was subject to the most extensive cyber-attacks it has faced since 2007,” its undersecretary for digital transformation said. “With some brief and minor exceptions, websites remained fully available throughout the day. The attack has gone largely unnoticed in Estonia.” Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Russia’s head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force said the building’s back-up support systems had been damaged in strikes. In the event of an accident, Igor Kirillov added, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused one another of orchestrating attacks on the plant and both have rebuffed each other’s accusations. Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, its interior minister has warned. Dozens of Ukraine’s emergency service workers wearing gas masks and hazmat suits took part in a disaster response drill amid fears of another Chernobyl-like disaster. The exercises saw them practice evacuating the injured, carrying out radiation scans, and washing down contaminated vehicles. “Nobody could have predicted that Russian troops would be firing on nuclear reactors with tanks. It is incredible,” Denys Monastyrsky said. As long as the plant is controlled by Russia there are “major risks”, the minister added. Russia has denied its forces had heavy weapons deployed at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, accusing Ukraine of stoking the fire ahead of a UN visit to the region. Kyiv was preparing a “provocation” during secretary general António Guterres’ stop that would see Moscow “accused of creating a man-made disaster at the plane,” its defence ministry said. “Russian troops have no heavy weapons either on the territory of the station or in the areas around it. There are only guard units,” a statement read. The ministry claimed Ukraine was deploying forces in the area and planned to launch artillery strikes on the plant from the city of Nikopol on Friday, coinciding with Guterres’s visit to Odessa. “The claim for the consequences [of the strikes] will be placed on the Russian armed forces,” the statement said. One more ship loaded with corn has left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, Turkey’s Defence Ministry has said. It is the first of four vessels to arrive at the country’s Black Sea port today, and marks the 25th to leave with grain under a UN-brokered export deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency has accepted Ukraine’s invitation to lead a delegation into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. “I emphasised the mission’s urgency to address nuclear security threats caused by Russia’s hostilities,” he added. The nuclear plant, which is Russian-occupied but run by Ukrainian staff, has faced intense shelling throughout the war, with both sides accusing one another of the attacks. Before I hand you over to my colleague, here is a quick rundown of where things stand: There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The strike follows yesterday’s attack on Kharkiv which killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. “What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. The southeast Asian country has maintained friendly ties with Russia and Moscow is seeking new customers for its energy in the region as its biggest export destination, Europe, will impose an embargo on Russian oil in phases later this year. “We have received permission to import petrol from Russia,” Reuters reports military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun as saying during a news conference on Wednesday, adding that it was favoured for its “quality and low cost”. There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The Kyiv Independent citied Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, as reporting that Russian forces launched rockets on Kharkiv overnight. Yesterday, another strike against a residential area killed seven people in Kharkiv. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank, the UK ministry of defence said in an update this morning. “This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the first Chechen war in 1994,” the report added. It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely. These deficiencies probably contribute to the widespread incidents of turret ejection, which are well documented in eye-witness videos from Ukraine.” The cumulative effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia’s forces,” British intelligence said. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. The statement comes amid fierce debate on whether the west should stop issuing Russian visas or discontinue allowing Russian citizens to visit on holiday. It’s hard to understand the nuances, it’s easier to hate and deny everyone - the solution is for an oyster. A smart man seeks allies, a fool repels friends.” These are tens and hundreds of thousands of people sitting on the fence who could switch to our side,” he wrote. And now they’re not going to do it.” The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, a senior Ukrainian presidential aide has said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Mykhaylo Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by the host and including India, Belarus, Mongolia, Tajikistan and other countries, China’s defence ministry said. China’s participation in the joint exercises was “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, the ministry said. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” (east) exercises from 30 August to 5 September, even as it wages a costly war in Ukraine. It said at the time that some foreign forces would participate, without naming them. China’s defence ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of a bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia. “The aim is to deepen practical and friendly cooperation with the armies of participating countries, enhance the level of strategic collaboration among the participating parties, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats.” Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The Black Sea fleet, which has a revered history in Russia, has suffered several humiliations since Russia invaded Ukraine in the hope of a swift victory. In April, Ukraine struck Russia’s flagship the Moskva, a huge cruiser, with Neptune missiles. It became the biggest warship to be sunk in combat for 40 years. A Russian strike on Kharkiv is believed to have killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Images of rescuers combining through the wreckage have since been shared by the emergency services. Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Ukrainian forces said on Thursday they had beaten back a Russian attack in the southern region of Kherson. “The stakes of the Russian Federation in this war have been raised,” Arestovych added. Ukraine’s ministry of defence said Russian forces were also moving aircraft further back into Crimea and away from the reach of Ukraine’s forces following the recent strikes in Crimea. “The Rashists [Russians] are urgently moving their planes and helicopters deep into the peninsula and to the airfields of the Russian Federation following the recent strikes in Crimea,” the ministry said in a briefing late last night. “The occupiers are carrying out measures to partially transfer aviation equipment from forward-based airfields in Crimea to reserve airfields and airfields permanently based on the territory of the Russian Federation,” the force added. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, in the western city of Lviv. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine ahead of a meeting later today with its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A Russian strike on Kharkiv killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week.

Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region that Russia has sought to blame on sabotage. At least 12 Russians were reportedly killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the state border guard service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Ukraine has not lost any US-supplied Himars rocket launchers, the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in contradiction to Russian claims. Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences.

Marine traffic sites showed the MV Brave Commander taking its cargo of 23,000 tonnes of wheat across the heart of Istanbul bound for its final destination in Djibouti next week. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Canada has disbursed C$450m ($348m) in loans for the purchase of heating fuel before winter for Ukraine, the finance minister in Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland, has announced.

The release of methane from drilling and during the extraction process, plus the extra carbon dioxide from burning gas, makes climate change more rapid and dangerous. One of the arguments against fracking has also been the probability of triggering earthquakes. But environmental activists who use the earth tremor argument against fracking should probably be cautious if they are in favour of alternative solutions – gaining geothermal energy and lithium via boreholes from hot rocks beneath our feet. For geothermal power, these extraction systems work by drilling down two deep boreholes into the rocks and then pumping water round a loop. The hot water from the depths is potentially a large source of carbon-free renewable energy. Lithium, needed for batteries for electric cars, and in demand globally in ever increasing quantities, is extracted by a somewhat similar method, depending on the local geology. The water pumped round the deep boreholes under the West Country dissolves lithium from the rocks that is extracted when the hot water returns to the surface. Once operational the heat and lithium extraction schemes in Cornwall should have no detrimental effect on the climate, but unsurprisingly the extraction method, as at the Eden Project in Cornwall, also causes earth tremors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/20/positive-signals-from-iran-over-nuclear-deal-put-west-in-a-tricky-position","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-20T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Positive signals from Iran over nuclear deal put west in a tricky position","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/positive-signals-from-iran-over-nuclear-deal-put-west-in-a-tricky-position","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/20/positive-signals-from-iran-over-nuclear-deal-put-west-in-a-tricky-position","fields":{"bodyText":"Wary western powers face an unlikely potential dilemma after a sudden push by Tehran to suggest that progress is being made to remove the last outstanding obstacles to a revived agreement to oversee Iran’s nuclear programme. The unlikely prospect of Joe Biden reviving the dormant 2015 nuclear deal, potentially lifting sanctions and opening the way for Iran to make billions of dollars in oil exports, would be seen as a gross betrayal by supporters of three-month-long street protests, as well as a controversial signal to send to Ukraine about Washington’s priorities. The west has accused Iran of providing hundreds of drones to Russia, and urged the UN to investigate whether the supply represents a breach of Iran’s obligations under existing UN security council resolutions. But the EU’s Iran negotiators have insisted that restraining Iran’s nuclear programme must be treated separately from all other Iranian issues, including its arming of Russia and domestic suppression. At the weekend the head of Iran’s steering council of foreign relations, Kamal Kharazi, said the only remaining outstanding obstacle to a nuclear agreement was settling the long-running dispute between Iran and the UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA over the origins and explanation of nuclear particles found at three sites in 2019. He is one of the few Iranian officials to claim all the other issues between the US and Iran over the revival of the deal had been resolved. At the same time, after a pause of many months, IAEA inspectors, led by its deputy director general for safeguards, Massimo Aparo, visited Tehran to meet Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdullahian, described the visit as “positive and forward-looking”, giving the overall impression that parts of the regime want a deal. He said a meeting with the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, in Jordan last week gave an opportunity to “complete the discussions”. The UN inspectors left Tehran without any comment on their talks but expectations were low given the long history of failed attempts to extract plausible Iranian explanations for the presence of the nuclear particles. It is possible Tehran’s optimism is merely opportunistic posturing to see if Tehran can expose western divisions over the possibility of rejoining a nuclear deal at a time Iran is accused of committing gross human rights violations and arming Russia. Rumours continue to circulate that Iran is about to execute many more than the two protesters put to death so far. But voices within Iran’s diplomatic corps genuinely believe Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi needs to revive the deal and, if he does not do so, he will have made a historic mistake by driving an isolated Iran into Moscow’s embrace. Economic pressures have also been growing on Iran to strike a deal. Since the protests started, the value of the Iranian rial against the dollar has fallen nearly 20%. Afshin Khani, the top foreign exchange official at the country’s central bank, was forced to resign last week and there have been calls for the governor Ali Salehabadi to follow suit. He has denied reports he is about to raise interest rates by 5% to prop up the currency. But with inflation at just over 50% this summer and the price of cars projected to have doubled in three months, blame is being pinned on Raisi’s ineffectual government. Europe is determined not to give up hopes of salvaging the nuclear deal on the basis that if Iran starts enriching to 90% it will have enough enriched uranium to make a bomb even if it lacks the missile warheads to deliver. Borrell said last week: “In spite of the fact that the nuclear deal remains in a stalemate and the escalation of Iran’s nuclear programme is of great concern, we have to continue engaging as much as possible in trying to revive this deal. I still believe that we have to separate the sanctions on human rights and arms provision to Russia from the nuclear programme, the escalation of which is of great concern.” The IAEA board had on 11 November passed a resolution saying it was essential and urgent for Iran to cooperate with the board over the source of the nuclear particles. The three sites at which Iran has not given a “satisfactory answers” to the IAEA are located in Varamin and Turquzabad near Tehran and Marivan in Kurdistan province. Iran said the particles may have come from abroad. The IAEA estimated that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% – a level just below that required to produce a nuclear weapon – by 6.7kg since 21 August. Iran wants the IAEA to permanently resolve the issue of the sites before it will sign the revived nuclear deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T16:10:51Z","webTitle":"Power is the drug, not the presidency | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","fields":{"bodyText":"Michael Meadowcroft argues that “the problem of directly elected heads of state is that the power it confers all too often becomes an addiction that drives them to manipulate the constitutional safeguards” (Letters, 23 September). He then cites Ireland as an example of indirect election of presidents. In fact, the Irish presidency is directly elected. Mr Meadowcroft also cites the example of Donald Trump to support his argument. The issue in respect of Trump is not that the head of state is directly elected, it is that the head of state in the US is also effectively head of government. I agree that some politicians become addicted to power, but that is caused by the drug of governmental power, not the drug of presidency. I doubt that Trump would have had any interest in the presidency if the US had an Irish-style system where he would have had only ceremonial duties. In another letter, Margaret Squires expresses concerns about a President Thatcher or Blair. Again, I would doubt that a limited, ceremonial presidency would have held any attraction for them. And even if an electorate does choose a questionable president, they get the chance to get rid of them a few years later.

If you haven’t heard of it, allow me to explain it. But strap yourself in, because hoo boy. Power Slap is a televised “sport” in which two people slap one other as hard as they can, with the aim of incapacitating their opponent to the point of unconsciousness. The players take turns unloading slaps so hard that it is uncomfortable to watch, while the opponent must stand with their arms by their side, since the rules forbid any form of defence (or even flinching). Power Slap has no British broadcaster, but in the US, where it is shown on TBS, it has caused a firestorm, not least because it is objectively stupid and dangerous, with slap fighters often ending up swollen and disfigured, and neurologists condemning the potential injuries they could sustain through repeated concussive impact to the head. And the people who run the league aren’t exactly lovely either. The show’s premiere was delayed, in fact, due to a video of Power Slap producer Dana White hitting his wife. A recent New Yorker piece did a good job of corralling the outrage. The boxer Ryan Garcia said: “Power slap is a horrible idea and it needs to be stopped.” Ariel Helwani, a sports journalist who reports on mixed martial arts, took aim at the state from which Power Slap is broadcast, saying: “Shame on Nevada for sanctioning that.” Even JT Tilley, who operates his own slap-fight league, admits that “90% of people can’t stand this sport”. But Power Slap is not just a sport. It is also a reality show, with the fighters all living together in a nice house, like the contestants on The Apprentice. The difference is that when the fighters leave the house, it is to hit each other as hard as they can. Does this make Power Slap the most awful reality show in the history of television? Not by a long shot. It sounds awful and exploitative, but is it any more awful and exploitative than Cheaters? That was the show in which members of the public could spy on their partners to see if they were unfaithful, before catching them in the act and – more often than not – having a screaming, knock-down fight with them. There was nothing about Cheaters that didn’t turn the stomach, yet it ran for more than 20 years. Is it worse than Fear Factor, a gameshow in which contestants had to commit to some of the most stomach-churning acts imaginable to win some cash? One episode, queasily titled Hee Haw! Hee Haw!, was so hideous that it was only shown on TV once, thanks to a challenge in which guests had to chug donkey semen and urine. But the most gruesome reality show of all time is probably The Moment of Truth, a 2008 US gameshow so sickening that 15 of its episodes were never aired. The premise? A subject is strapped to a polygraph and asked 100 questions of increasing intimacy. The more of these questions they agree to answer on air, the more money they win. In one episode, introduced by its own host as a piece of TV that didn’t deserve to see the light of day, a woman admitted to stealing money from work, to wishing she had married someone other than her husband (who was in the audience with his head in his hands), and to having sex with other men since being married. She was eliminated for answering yes to the question “Are you a good person?”. It was unimaginably horrible from start to finish. In fact, Power Slap may not even qualify as the worst reality show of the moment. Netflix is producing Squid Game: The Challenge, in which the fictional lethal knockout game is played for real by members of the public. While the reality version draws a line at killing the participants, there have been reports that multiple contestants have required medical assistance during filming, with others likening it to a war zone. It certainly sounds as if it will be very difficult to watch. Does Power Slap sound good? No. But the worst ever? Let’s retain some perspective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T19:20:24Z","webTitle":"Are Putin’s nuclear threats really likely to lead to Armageddon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","fields":{"bodyText":"The past week has seen a rapid escalation in nuclear rhetoric, beginning with Vladimir Putin’s threat to use “all forces and means” to defend newly seized territory in Ukraine and ending with Joe Biden’s warning of “Armageddon” if Russia crosses the nuclear Rubicon. However, the realities underlying the menacing vocabulary are a far greyer area than the bluster suggests. It is far from certain that Putin would be prepared to be the first leader to use nuclear weapons in wartime since 1945, over his territorial ambitions in Ukraine. If his primary goal is to stay in power, that could be exactly the wrong way of going about it. Even if he did issue the launch order, he has no guarantee it would be carried out. Nor can he be absolutely sure that the weapons and their delivery systems would work. On the US side, despite the US president’s apocalyptic language at a private fundraiser on Thursday night, it is not at all inevitable that Washington would respond to Putin’s nuclear use with nuclear retaliation. Past wargaming suggests there would be vigorous debate within the administration to say the least. Like US presidents, Putin is normally accompanied by an aide carrying a briefcase with codes used to authorise a nuclear launch. In the US it is called the football, in Russia it is the cheget. In the Russian system, the defence minister and the chief of the general staff have their own chegets but it is believed that Putin can order a launch without them. However, the cheget is relevant for the strategic nuclear forces, the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from land or sea, or long-range bombers. Because they need to be launched within minutes in case of enemy attack, the warheads need to be deployed, mounted on the delivery systems. Any nuclear use in Ukraine would be likely to involve non-strategic, or tactical, weapons with shorter-range delivery systems, and which are usually (but not necessarily) less powerful than strategic arms, though on average they are many times more powerful that the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs. The US only has one kind of tactical weapon, the B61 gravity bomb, of which there are about a hundred in Europe and a similar number in the US, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). FAS estimates Russia has 2,000 tactical weapons, in very many shapes and sizes for use on land, sea and air. The weapons are not deployed on missiles or aircraft, but kept in bunkers in storage sites dotted around Russia. There are 12 national storage sites, known in Russian military parlance as “Object S”, one of which is in Belgorod, right on the Ukrainian border. There are also 34 “base-level” sites, closer to the delivery systems. In a time of crisis, warheads would be moved from national to base-level sites – and up to now western intelligence agencies say no such movement has been observed. Any such movement would be carried out by the 12th main directorate of the Russian armed forces, which has the job of storing and maintaining the warheads and then delivering them in specialised trains or trucks to base-level sites, or directly to the unit designated to launch them. Pavel Baev, a military researcher who worked for the Soviet defence ministry, said that Putin cannot count on these weapons actually working. “Most of these warheads stored there are very old,” Baev, now a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said. “Without testing it’s really hard to say how suitable they are because many of them are past their expiration date.” Baev added that it was also far from clear that the Russian can successfully pair old warheads with the much newer delivery systems that would have to be used, possibly 9K720 Iskander or Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. Not all analysts have such a dim view of the state of the tactical arsenal. Pavel Podvig, who runs a research project called Russian Nuclear Forces and is a senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said: “There’s a maintenance protocol. There are ways of checking whether a weapon is in good health.” What may be more likely to break down, however, is the chain of command if Putin gave such an alarming and extreme order. “It’s one thing to follow the order to start a ‘special military operation’ that you understand will be over in three days,” Podvig said. “It’s another thing to accept the order to drop a nuclear bomb. There’s a sense that this kind of order would be universally considered as criminal. I think the calculation would change.” The Russian leader is already reported to be facing dissent from his inner circle. Taking the leap to nuclear use could stretch his authority to breaking point. “I think it would be prohibitively risky for any commander-in-chief to give this order because if you give the order and it’s not executed, it backfires,” Baev said. If Putin decided to gamble everything and if his military officers went along with him and managed to detonate a weapon in or around Ukraine, then Biden and his team would be faced with choices that all modern US presidents have hoped they would never have to make. US warnings to Russia in recent days have been vague on what the response would be, saying only that it would be “catastrophic”. The White House needs to keep its room for manoeuvre, depending on what Russia does, whether it is a “demonstration” blast over the Black Sea or the Arctic, or the bombing of a Ukrainian military target or – the worst-case scenario – a city. In 2016, the Obama administration carried out war gaming exercises to test its communications channels and decision-making process in the event of a Russian use of a tactical nuclear weapon. There were deep disagreements that led on some occasions to heated arguments. “The debate broke down along two pretty important lines,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was Barack Obama’s special assistant and senior director at the national security council for arms control and non-proliferation. The first question was whether “the US or Nato needed to respond militarily”. “In the game, the answer was no. The US was winning the conventional war,” Wolfsthal, who writes a Substack column titled BoomBoomBoom, said. The counter-argument was that the US could not afford not to respond with nuclear weapons. “There were those who said if you don’t use nuclear weapons, two terrible things will happen. One is: all of our allies will doubt our commitment,” he said. “The second is: if you don’t use a nuclear weapon in response, how do you deter Putin from going nuclear again? You needed nukes to re-establish deterrence. “We never answered that. We never settled that debate,” Wolfsthal said. The 2016 war game – first reported in The Bomb, a book by Fred Kaplan – was played twice, at the level of cabinet secretary, the “principals” and by their deputies. The principals voted to respond with a nuclear strike, but not on Russia, in the hope of avoiding an all-out planet-ending nuclear exchange. Instead they struck Belarus, arguing it was a “belligerent non-combatant”. The deputies voted not to respond with nuclear weapons, arguing that the US could win with conventional weapons and that nuclear use would make it much harder to isolate Putin internationally. Two of the officials who pushed that option are now in senior positions in the Biden administration: Colin Kahl is the Pentagon’s policy chief, and Avril Haines is the director of national intelligence. After the war games were over, Haines suggested having T-shirts printed with the slogan “Deputies Should Run the World”. The 2016 war game was set in a Baltic nation, so inside Nato and under its protective nuclear umbrella. Ukraine stands outside that umbrella. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary is reported to have voted for a nuclear response in 2016. He would not comment or even confirm the war game took place, but he said Ukraine was a very different case. “I would say that if the line is crossed to nuclear use, there has to be a very, very strong response,” he told the Guardian. “But that response doesn’t have to be nuclear.” The key question is more likely to be whether the US and its allies should respond with devastating conventional firepower, as Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, and the former CIA director David Petraeus have suggested. But that would transform the war into one between Russia and Nato, in which escalation to a nuclear exchange could become hard to stop. According to Eric Schlosser, the author of a book about the nuclear establishment, Command and Control, the Pentagon’s Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) conducted another war game in 2019 focused on Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. That wargame appears to have been updated, suggesting it is in constant use. The results in 2019 are top secret, but as Schlosser wrote in the Atlantic, one of the participants told him: “There were no happy outcomes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T03:04:46Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear inspectors shut down Russian ‘dirty bomb’ claim against Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog has confirmed it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity after inspecting three sites at Ukraine’s request in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. Moscow has accused Ukraine of planning to use such a bomb – a conventional explosive device laced with radioactive material – and said institutes linked to the nuclear industry were involved in preparations, without presenting evidence. Ukraine’s government denies the accusation. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, hailed the conclusion, calling it “quite obvious” in his latest national address. “We have invited the IAEA to check, we have given them full freedom of action at the relevant facilities, and we have clear and irrefutable evidence that no one in Ukraine has created or is creating any dirty bombs,” he said. “The only thing that is dirty in our region now is the heads of those in Moscow who, unfortunately, seized control of the Russian state and are terrorising Ukraine and the whole world.” Some Ukrainian and western officials have accused Moscow of making the allegation to give itself cover to detonate its own dirty bomb and pin the blame on Kyiv. The US rejected as “transparently false” Russia’s accusations. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, noted that “the world would see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation”. In a statement released late on Thursday, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said: “Over the past few days, the inspectors were able to carry out all activities that the IAEA had planned to conduct and were given unfettered access to the locations. “Based on the evaluation of the results available to date and the information provided by Ukraine, the agency did not find any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the locations.” The IAEA said in October it would inspect two locations in Ukraine after a request by Kyiv. On Monday it said those inspections had begun and on Thursday it said they had been completed at three locations rather than two, all of which had been mentioned by Russia. The IAEA named the locations as the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv, Eastern Mining and Processing Plant in Zhovti Kody, and Production Association Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant in Dnipro. The IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said evaluation of the results “did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials” and environmental samples that were taken at the sites would be sent for lab analysis with results to be reported “as soon as possible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T17:51:19Z","webTitle":"Finnish PM faces battle to hang on to power as general election goes to wire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","fields":{"bodyText":"Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, was facing a battle to hold on to power on Sunday with the country’s conservative opposition National Coalition party (NCP) holding a narrow early lead in a knife-edge general election. Among the 40% of voters who cast their ballots before election day, the NCP garnered a score of 20.8%, fractionally ahead of Marin’s centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on 20.7%. The far-right nationalist Finns party scored 18.6%. The early vote tally is often skewed, however, and analysts warned against reading too much into the partial results as counting continued. Marin said after seeing the early results she was confident her party would win a big share of election-day votes. The party winning the vote will have the first shot at forming a coalition, but talks are set to be long and tortuous, with polls in the election run-up showing the three main parties in an almost dead heat and reliant on smaller parties to form a coalition. Marin, 37, became the world’s youngest prime minister when she assumed the leadership of the SDP – and the Finnish premiership – in 2019 and has successfully led the country through the Covid pandemic and to the brink of Nato membership. Her determination to enjoy a social life has also made headlines, with fans hailing her as a rising star of the centre-left and model for a new generation of young female leaders. Critics argue that her behaviour has at times been inappropriate for her office. She was forced to apologise and took a drug test last year, but also defended her right to party, after photos and video emerged of her drinking and dancing with friends. Marin remains more popular than her party and rival political leaders, with an opinion poll for the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper in December finding 64% of respondents felt she had done a “very” or “fairly” good job as prime minister. But with recession forecast and inflation surging, opposition leaders’ accusations of excessive government borrowing and inflated public spending – along with their pledges to impose tough cuts, particularly on welfare budgets – have proved effective. The NCP’s Petteri Orpo has promised to slash spending on unemployment and housing benefits. “The most important thing in the next government is to fix our economy and push economic growth,” he said during campaigning. Riikka Purra of the Finns – who were part of a coalition government from 2015 to 2017 – says their priority is to cut non-EU immigration, promising also to focus on climate, crime and energy policies if it is part of the new coalition. Whoever emerges as the winner, coalition negotiations are set to be tough, with the SDP and two of its current five-party coalition, the Greens and the Left Alliance, all ruling out any alliance with with the Finns, which Marin has called “openly racist”. Of the two others, the Swedish People’s party, a moderate party representing Swedish-speaking Finns, has said it is “very unlikely” to partner with the far-right Finns. The once-powerful agrarian Centre party, on the other hand, whose vote has plunged in recent years, will not join any coalition resembling the current one. The NCP has not excluded any combination, saying it will wait to see the results. If the NCP finishes first, it could try to put together a right-leaning “blue-black” coalition with the Finns, or pursue a broad “blue-red” alliance with the SDP, an outcome many analysts see as most likely despite obvious policy differences. As many as 10 parties could win seats in the 200-seat parliament. The outcome should be clear by midnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T17:53:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 191 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian energy giant Gazprom has announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday.

The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he said. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. The Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials were “making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit”. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday: “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA, which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” G7 finance ministers have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, the ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin warned that imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders decided to impose price caps on Russian oil, it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in the 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes. The government has said Ukraine could harvest 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying: “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continued to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counter-offensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova on Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Children returned to Ukrainian schools left damaged by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. A senior Russian oil executive died on Thursday after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:22:02Z","webTitle":"Russia readies for southern offensive as alarm raised over shelling of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. The assessment came as both sides traded blame for renewed shelling on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with the UN nuclear watchdog raising grave concerns about the attack. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” said the UK’s defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief. According to a separate source with Ukraine’s military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source. One of the major obstacles to Ukraine’s offensive in the south could be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe’s largest, which was shelled on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it was a crime and “an act of terror”, saying the shelling was carried out by Russian forces. In a phone call on Sunday with the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, about the plant, Zelenskiy called for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry and nuclear fuel in response. But the head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. It was not possible on Saturday to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. Ukraine’s nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said that containers of spent fuel had been hit in the latest shelling, damaging three radiation monitoring sensors and injuring one employee. Spent fuel is highly radioactive, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a statement on Telegram, Energoatom said the damage meant it was currently impossible to detect increased radiation or leakage of radiation from the spent fuel containers. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the size of the plant “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond”. The UK’s defence ministry predicts Russia’s war in Ukraine will soon enter a “new phase” as it believes the fighting will shift from Donbas to a 217-mile front stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson. At present, the brunt of Russia’s attacks is around what remains of Ukrainian-controlled eastern Donbas. Russian forces are still trying to achieve their aim of capturing the whole of Donbas. Russian forces now control Luhansk oblast, with the exception of a few small settlements, and about half of Donetsk oblast. Russia is currently carrying out two offensives to capture the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka and continuing to shell dozens of towns and villages from all directions, according to a statement by Ukraine’s general staff. Russian forces now appear to be occupying the southern part of Pisky, a village in Donetsk oblast near Avdivvka, as well as the small settlement of Travneve, 11 miles south of Bakhmut, according to the ISW, which reported that the Ukrainian army seemed to be holding the line elsewhere. Ukraine’s general staff said on Sunday that Russia was deploying troops and air defence systems to Belarus. However, the same Ukrainian military intelligence source said no offensive formations had been detected in Belarus, though rocket attacks from its northern neighbour continued to be a threat. Meanwhile, four more ships successfully left Ukraine’s ports, raising hopes that the deal brokered by Turkey and the UN to end Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports might hold. Russia’s decision to strike Odesa port hours after the deal was signed cast doubt on that. The deal is valid for 120 days and can be renewed if both sides agree. The first ship to set sail from Ukraine’s ports since the invasion left on Monday. Twenty million tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since February, pushing some import-dependent countries in the Middle East and north Africa toward famine. Before the war, Ukraine exported some 6m to 8m tons of grain a month. Using its rivers and railways, Ukraine is managing to export about 2m tons a month and hopes the reopening of its ports will increase the total to 3m a month in four to six weeks’ time, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told Bloomberg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"US elementary school tested for nuclear bomb waste from Manhattan Project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","fields":{"bodyText":"The US army corps of engineers is testing for radioactivity in the kindergarten play yard, sports fields and classrooms of a Missouri school serving mostly Black students, after an independent report revealed the school may have been contaminated by nuclear bomb-making waste dumped from the second world war’s Manhattan Project. Children from Jana elementary school in the Northern St Louis area were sent home to do online learning last week, following an independent report that found levels of the radioactive isotype lead-210 as much as 22 times the expected levels in the school’s play yards and some indoor spaces. For decades nearby areas of North St Louis have been undergoing cleanup for radioactive dumping dating back to the 1940s through 1960s, after the region played an integral role in processing uranium for the development of the atomic bomb. Radioactive hotspots have been discovered in Coldwater Creek, which runs next to the original disposal sites some four miles from the school and then snakes past the school itself. The independent study released in October by a radiation testing firm, the Boston Chemical Data Corp, revealed concerning levels of radiation in locations including inside the school and its play yards. This prompted last week’s school shutdown. The report, which was paid for by a local law firm, also found levels of radium-226 in the school’s soil at double the expected background levels. The report said the level of radioactive lead found on the school grounds was many times higher than the levels allowed by the EPA for Superfund sites, the highly toxic places slated for government cleanups. It said the lead-210 likely resulted from the breakdown of other nuclear waste ingredients. “Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210 found on school grounds were entirely unacceptable,” said the report. It noted that the lead emits alpha particles, which are among the most biologically damaging type of radiation. The US army corps of engineers, which is in charge of the radiation cleanup, has questioned the findings of that report. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the corps was evaluating the independent study and would release its conclusions, as well as the results of its new sampling, in the next two weeks. It said that in 2018 and 2019 its own experts had “identified an area of low-level radioactive contamination on a densely wooded bank of Coldwater Creek. This area is just inside the edge of the school property and not easily accessible.” On Wednesday, teams of its workers in yellow and orange vests fanned out around the school grounds to redo the testing. One worker scanned the school lawn with a radiation detection device mounted on the end of a pole, others marked spots on the sports fields with bright orange bags, while a group of workers operating a boring machine collected core samples from the earth as deep as 28ft beneath the school. “Our team has the right expertise and experience to complete this work,” said Col. Kevin Golinghorst, the Corps’ St Louis District commander in a press release. Two blocks away from the school in a yellow and white tract home proudly displaying a sign on the porch that reads “Jana Elementary Student of the Month”, parent Rodney Green watched his two daughters studying math and English at his dining room table. “We already had to do this online learning during the pandemic – now it’s this,” he said. He was considering taking them to a doctor to test them for radiation effects. Now he worries about his home, which sits only a few houses from the creek. “What if we can’t live out here? Do I have to sell?” he said. “This is a whole community that’s affected. It’s crazy.” School PTA President Ashley Bernaugh, who has been asking for answers since the Army Corps first began testing near the school in 2018, said that she believes cleanup would have happened a lot faster if Jana elementary wasn’t in a mostly Black area. “Jana elementary’s radioactive past looks like a lot of other communities where hazardous waste has been allowed to exist in predominantly minority communities and in lower middle income communities, where it never would have been allowed in upper income level communities because of the public outrage,” said Bernaugh. The history of the radioactive waste in Northern St Louis goes back to 1942, when a company called Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, located along the Mississippi River in the city’s downtown, was contracted by the federal government to process the uranium that was eventually sent to New Mexico to make atomic bombs. The waste from that operation was stored near what is now the St Louis airport. In the 1960s, the waste was transferred to another company, which sold off valuable ingredients and transferred other portions of the waste to two other dump sites in the area. Cleanup of the dumps began in the late 1990s. Residents have been concerned about the health effects of lingering radiation for years. A 2013 Missouri health study found that the number of cases of leukemia, and breast, colon, prostrate, kidney and bladder cancers faced by residents in zip codes near the creek were “statistically significantly higher” than the rate for the rest of Missouri, according to reporting by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Jared Opsal, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, worried the radiation discovered at the school could pose particular dangers to children. “People – and especially children – should not still be collateral damage for World War II,” said Opsal, who said he hopes the federal government will expand and speed up its cleanup efforts, now slated to go on until 2038. “This is WWII nuclear weapons waste and people are still being harmed by it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"bodyText":"The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"Guardian Essential poll: majority of Australians favour capping power prices, lifting wages and cheaper childcare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","fields":{"bodyText":"More than three-quarters of voters support capping electricity and gas prices and reducing the tax on petrol as Australians call for more cost-of-living relief in the lead-up to the budget. The Guardian Essential poll of 1,133 people found 77% of voters approve those measures, with a majority also in favour of increasing the minimum wage, cheaper childcare and cutting income tax. Voters were also overwhelmingly of the view that the prime minister should be required to get parliamentary approval before going to war, with 90% in favour and just 10% saying they should not need approval. Last week a parliamentary inquiry recommended that parliament have input after the decision to go to war, with ministers forced to explain the “legal basis” for going to war. The poll found respondents under cost-of-living pressure on a range of expenses, including 70% finding it “a bit difficult” or “struggling” to afford housing expenses including rent and mortgage payments, and 64% who said the same of utility bills. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Most voters said that governments could make a difference to the cost of living: 31% said “a lot” of difference, 40% “a fair amount”, 18% “not that much”, 5% “hardly anything” and 6% “unsure”. Support was highest for capping prices for electricity and gas, and reducing fuel excise, with 77% describing these as “something that would make a difference and the government should do”. However, 18% said cutting petrol tax was “something that would make a difference but the government should not do” and a further 5% said it wouldn’t work. A majority were also in favour of increasing the minimum wage (73%), making childcare cheaper (66%), cutting income tax (60%) and changing industrial laws so it’s easier for workers to negotiate pay rises (57%). On Friday the Albanese government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission’s annual minimum wage review calling for the wages of the low-paid to keep up with inflation. In the lead-up to the May budget the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has said the government’s job is to look at “how we can provide cost-of-living relief” without making the job of the Reserve Bank to reduce inflation harder. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said cost-of-living relief was a “priority” but needed to be provided in “the most responsible and affordable way consistent with the budget constraints that we’ve got, as well”. In addition to capping coal and gas prices, the energy price relief plan passed in December promised $1.5bn in consumer rebates to flow after the budget. In September, Labor made the unpopular decision to allow the temporary six-month halving of petrol tax to lapse. The poll was conducted last week after Labor and the Greens announced a deal with an absolute cap on emissions that helped the government pass its safeguard mechanism requiring industries to reduce emissions intensity in the Senate. The poll found the proportion of Australians who say not enough is being done to combat climate change fell four points to 39%, while those who said it is doing too much increased by four points to 16%. Thirty-three per cent said it was doing enough – up one point – while 12% said they did not know. About half (51%) backed the establishment of a national authority to manage the transition to renewable energy, a proposal supported by Australian unions and the Greens. Half were in support of “governments assessing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions when considering the approval of new projects, including coal and gas”, another measure backed by the Greens but rejected by Labor in negotiations. Despite the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, citing earlier Guardian Essential polling that 62% of Australians want to stop new coal, the new poll found support drops to just 34% when respondents were asked about “ending all future coal mining and gas extraction projects”. The safeguard deal imposed a requirement of net zero emissions on the Beetaloo basin and liquefied natural gas export projects, but not gas for domestic consumption, reflecting Labor’s view new projects might be needed to support its use as a transition fuel. There was a small movement within the margin of error in relation to Anthony Albanese’s approval, down one point to 52%, with disapproval up one to 35%. A bigger increase was recorded among those who said they “strongly disapproved” of the job he was doing, up three points to 17%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T05:01:08Z","webTitle":"US utilities shut off power to millions amid record corporate profits – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","fields":{"bodyText":"Some of America’s largest utilities cut power to millions of struggling customers in recent years even as they spent billions of dollars on stock buybacks, dividend payments to shareholders and executive salaries, a new analysis of industry data has found. The report also reveals that companies could use just a tiny fraction of their investor and executive spending to forgive debt at all households where power was cut. The shutoffs disproportionately affect low-income customers and those from communities of color, and the “harrowing” situation is driven by corporate profiteering, said Selah Goodson Bell, a study co-author and energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity. Losing power has an often devastating impact on a household, including in terms of health and safety. “Shutoffs allow corporate utilities to punish customers’ economic precarity while guaranteeing record profits and massive payouts for themselves and their investors,” the authors wrote in the report. It was compiled with the utility industry analyst Energy and Policy Institute and BailoutWatch. In the 30 states where shutoff data was available, utilities cut service 1.5m times during the first 10 months of 2022, and an estimated 4.2m times nationwide. The report also reveals the issue is worsening: the number of electric shutoffs jumped by nearly one-third and gas shutoffs spiked by 76% between 2021 and the first 10 months of 2022. Illinois posted the highest number of shutoffs during that time period at over 500,000, and it was followed by Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. Exelon Corp, the parent company to utility giants like ComEd in Illinois and Peco in Pennsylvania, reported 648,000 shutoffs. It was followed by The Southern Co, DTE Energy, Ameren and FirstEnergy. Some of the companies that probably have the highest totals aren’t included. Between 2020-2021, Florida utilities shut off power 1.4m times, a “staggering” figure largely driven by NextEra’s Florida Light and Power division. But Florida no longer requires utilities to keep track of disconnections. The report highlighted how little utilities would need to cut into dividends, stock buybacks and executive salaries to forgive customer debt. It examined financial filings from 12 large utilities responsible for 86% of the shutoffs between January 2020 and October 2022. On average each spent about $4bn on dividends, and customer debt from their collective 4.9m shutoffs totaled about 1% of their dividend spending. “That was one of the data points that really hit home because that’s just such a small scrape of the amount of money that utilities are shelling out to shareholders that could really change lives in millions of households,” Goodson Bell said. FirstEnergy, which serves Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio, shut off power about 240,000 times for customer debts totalling about $25m. Meanwhile, the company paid $2.3bn in dividends. The 12 companies collectively paid about 70 top executives $1.2bn, or about $5.9m annually per executive. NextEra, which cut power most frequently before it was no longer required to report data, is much more generous to its executives and shareholders. The company paid the highest average pay-per-executive at $11.2m, and spent the second highest on dividends at $8.1bn. Increasing gas and electricity prices are partly driving the number of shutoffs, but so are regulatory decisions to allow companies to almost always pass on increased costs to customers. Utilities also continue investing in capital-intensive projects that in many cases are good for their investors but not cost effective for consumers, who could benefit from community solar, rooftop solar or other distributed energy sources. As climate change creates more extreme hot and cold, more pressure is put on low-income customers who can’t afford the extra use of a furnace or air conditioner. The authors say addressing the situation would require including uniform federal record keeping, a halt on new fossil fuel investment, and a ban on punitive billing practices. States could tax utility profits to pay off customer debt, design more effective debt relief programs, eliminate consumer debt, and develop a percentage-of-income-based payment plan. But the clearest solution, Goodson Bell said, is a ban on shutoffs. “Since we see energy as a human right and shutoffs are not something that the utility industry needs to do to financially operate, we’re calling for a permanent ban,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T18:56:07Z","webTitle":"Centrica’s buyback is a heavy hint to Sunak about windfall tax | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","fields":{"bodyText":"Back in July, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, tried to sound sheepish about reinstating its dividend at a penny a share at a moment when customers were braced for higher energy bills. The company accompanied its move with feelgood boasts about how it expected to pay £600m under Rishi Sunak’s three-year “energy profits levy” on North Sea oil and gas production. Four months later, there is less bashfulness. Earnings will be “towards the top end of the range” of analysts’ expectations, Thursday’s trading update said, and shareholders can have a much more significant distribution – a buyback of 5% of the share capital, which will cost roughly £250m. The shares rose 6%. Centrica, it seems, will live with the flak – and since its largesse is nothing compared with the oil majors’, you can understand the thinking. But Sunak, let’s hope, read Centrica’s update in detail. The North Sea fields and energy traders are still doing nicely (less so British Gas during warm weather) but an unspecified chunk of the forecast-beating returns are coming from electricity generation. That refers to Centrica’s 20% holding in the UK’s nuclear power stations, a part of the energy industry untouched by the North Sea-only windfall tax. Nuclear, though, is every bit as much of a cash cow currently. Its operating costs haven’t budged but, since the price of electricity is tied to the price of gas, revenues will be through the roof. The government has danced ineffectually around the generation sector for months, pondering price caps and voluntary negotiations to switch projects on to new-era “contracts for difference”, but no solution has yet appeared. It’s time to make a decision. If all the technocratic solutions are deemed to be too fiddly, then it has to be windfall levy. With nuclear, the case is particularly strong because there is no question of creating disincentives to future investment (the grumble from renewables developers). Any future nuclear plant, such as Sizewell C, would be funded by a bespoke financing and pricing model. Centrica, note, will have taken its share buyback decision in full knowledge that some form of levy is likely on nuclear’s windfall returns. And it still thinks it can afford £250m. Sunak should take the hint. Wolfson is right about foreign workers The last time Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, pleaded for the government to allow more foreign workers into the UK, he received a pile of abuse from a prime minister (Boris Johnson) who hadn’t bothered to understand his proposal. The leave-supporting Wolfson wasn’t – and still isn’t – advocating uncontrolled immigration. Rather, he wants a demand-led system that would incentivise UK businesses to hire local workers. Overseas recruits would have to be paid the same as local counterparts, and the employer would pay a 10% surcharge to the Treasury on the wages of foreign-hired labour. “It would automatically mean that businesses never bought someone into the company from outside if they could find someone in the UK,” he said in a BBC interview released on Thursday. “But if they genuinely can’t, they’ll pay the premium.” Last time around, Johnson launched a kneejerk Brexit refrain about British business being addicted to cheap foreign labour, which completely missed the point. A question now, then, is whether the latest inhabitants of Downing Street will engage with the real issue: the lack of flexibility in the UK’s labour market that plainly comes at a cost to growth. Under Liz Truss, there were nods of recognition. The deregulation part of her short-lived agenda contained a push to reform the shortage occupations list to cover, for instance, seasonal agricultural workers and broadband engineers. Where does Sunak stand? We’ll find out (possibly) in next week’s autumn statement, but business lobbyists suspect he’ll be in the Johnson camp. They anticipate no pro-business measures on immigration. If so, it will be another missed opportunity. Wolfson is right that it’s time to move on from tired referendum-era arguments. Hospitals, pubs, restaurants and many other sectors are crying out for a pragmatic approach. His proposal offers a sensible way forward.

Among his accusers was his own mother, forced to join in the taunting. China’s future leader was targeted mostly because his father, a top Communist cadre, was purged by Chairman Mao Zedong. His fall dragged the family down too; Xi’s half-sister died, reportedly after intense abuse. Half a century later, the teenage boy publicly humiliated in the capital has become China’s most powerful ruler since Mao, and perhaps – given his singular control of a superpower – the most powerful man in the world. His rise was not predestined. He fought his way to the top over decades, but with such discretion that when he took over in 2012, almost no one knew what type of leader he would be. His father, Xi Zhongxun, had been a respected party elder and a former vice-premier known for a relatively liberal outlook. For years, reformers inside and outside China hoped his son might have inherited his politics along with a strong physical resemblance. Instead, the younger Xi has bolstered the party and its networks of surveillance and control over individuals and business. He swept away norms of collective rule instituted after Mao died to concentrate power in his own hands, and fostered a personality cult to bolster his strongman approach. He is all but certain to end this week confirmed as national leader for a historic third term, and with his approach, which combines repression and surveillance at home with aggression abroad, cemented in place for at least five more years. A ‘red princeling’ shaped by Maoist indoctrination Xi was born a “red princeling”, a child of the Communist party elite, in 1953, four years after Mao declared the establishment of the new People’s Republic. His earliest years were a gilded, gated existence as a child of a senior party leader. He was educated in the elite August 1st School, a cradle of future leaders. The Cultural Revolution, launched by Mao in 1966 as part of an internal power struggle, shattered that world permanently. But there had been earlier warnings of horrors to come. In 1962, when Xi was nine, his father had a spectacular fall from grace. Accused of leading an “anti-party clique” – in the obscure world of elite Chinese politics part of the case against him was support for an obliquely critical novel – the elder Xi was sent into internal exile, managing a tractor factory hundreds of miles away. Then came the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when violent gangs of ideologically crazed teenage “red guards” held all of China ransom. At its peak, the elder Xi was beaten, publicly interrogated and paraded through the streets. He spent most of the following decade in prison. His downfall meant the next generation of his family became targets too. Xi Jinping’s half-sister is thought to have killed herself after intense persecution. At one point the future national leader was in a small group ambushed by club-wielding red guards at school and had to literally run for his life. The atmosphere was so volatile that when Xi once fled detention and ran home, his mother promptly reported him to authorities to avoid being accused of shielding him and bringing further trouble to the family, according to an account by Yang Ping, a friend of his father. “I had a stubborn streak in me and I couldn’t stand being bullied,” Xi recalled in an essay published in 2002. “I antagonised the radicals [red guards], and they blamed me for everything that went wrong.” In 1968, as part of Mao’s campaign to send young people to the countryside to be “re-educated” by peasants, Xi was sent to live in a tiny village in China’s north-west, to help with back-breaking rural labour. In the official narrative, Xi’s endurance of hardship in this period toughened him; Liangjiahe has now been turned into a pilgrimage site. “When I went to the countryside as a 15-year-old, I was perplexed and lost. By the time I left at the age of 22, I had a clear life goal and was filled with confidence,” he wrote in the 2002 essay. Xi returned to Beijing when universities reopened seven years later, and he was accepted as a “worker-peasant-soldier” student at Tsinghua University on a programme that enrolled students not on academic merit but class background. These years left him with a sense of threat and insecurity that would last his entire life, and manifest in his policies once he achieved ultimate power, analysts say. “He was influenced by the environment in which he grew up and the indoctrination he imbibed in his teenage years,” said Chen Daoyin, a former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “In his youth, he was always in an insecure position … He was psychologically vulnerable.” A former victim of political struggles, the elder Xi had lobbied for a law to protect the freedom to express political opinions. But the younger Xi was shaped by Maoist propaganda and brutal party politics, analysts say. “His father was a liberal, but he went to jail. To avoid his father’s fate, Xi learned to do things in an opposite fashion,” said Willy Lam, a veteran China watcher. Protecting the party and consolidating power The turmoil of that time traumatised everyone who lived through it. After Mao’s death, China’s leaders concluded that power should never again be concentrated in the hands of a single man. They set up a system of collective leadership that lasted until Xi’s rule. Xi Jinping appears to have drawn almost the opposite conclusion and reverted to Mao’s ruling style. Both in his image and rhetoric, he emulates the late Great Leader. He has accumulated power, shored up the authority of the Communist party and cultivated a personality cult, as if personal strength and the system that once tormented him were China’s only bulwark against another descent into chaos. Under his decade-long rule, authorities have vastly expanded censorship and party controls on the economy, created a sprawling network of internment camps in western Xinjiang and have been accused of genocide for abuses including mass detentions and forced sterilisation. Across China they carried out the harshest crackdown on civil society since the bloody destruction of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. Human rights lawyers have been detained, jailed or disqualified, non-governmental organisations have been closed or forced to disband, media censorship tightened and outspoken journalists and activists jailed or silenced. “The lesson that Xi had learned was that by being a good and obedient communist, you could survive and even thrive, even if that meant forgetting the party’s treatment of his father,” said Prof Michel Bonnin, an expert on the Cultural Revolution at the Paris-based École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. “It was better to be a good child of Chairman Mao than a rebel.” He never turned on the organisation that had presided over his early misery and loss, applying for party membership seven times. He was only granted it after his father’s political status had been downgraded from its Cultural Revolution extremes. Instead, after university he set out on an initially uneventful career as a young cadre, his path smoothed by his parents – who reportedly put in calls to his first boss in central China and then pulled strings to have him moved to coastal Fujian province. He spent the best part of two decades there, rising slowly but steadily through party ranks, from a peripheral district to provincial party chief, while commuting to Beijing to spend time with his glamorous second wife, the singer Peng Liyuan. Peng, whose elegant image helps boost China’s soft power abroad, once performed for the troops who cleared democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square. Xi was in Fujian when one of the biggest corruption scandals of recent decades came to light. Authorities raided the “red mansion”, where a wealthy businessman treated officials to food, drink and sex workers, in order to curry favour for his projects. Yet somehow he emerged personally unscathed. Instead, he may have taken away a heightened sense of how corruption was eroding public faith in the party, and how anti-corruption drives could be used to target political rivals. Purges have been a key instrument in his consolidation of power over the last decade, reaching to the very top of the party. When he was not yet 40, another traumatic upheaval sharpened Xi’s instinct for autocracy – this time a geopolitical collapse, rather than a national or personal crisis. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991, after Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempt at reforms, has haunted China’s Communist party. To Xi, the implosion of the party and system that inspired China’s own communists was a warning that political liberalisation and a lapse in ideological control would lead to disaster. He saw a political vulnerability that matched his personal insecurities. Soon after he came to power in late 2012 he told party cadres that they must study the collapse of their neighbour, and return to Leninist discipline. “In the end, just one blithe word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist party, and a great party was gone,” Xi reportedly said. “In the end, there was no real man who came out to resist.” It was a failure Xi was determined not to repeat. Yet while Xi has deftly consolidated power and removed obstacles to his rule, critics say he lacks intellectual grounding for leadership, even if “Xi Jinping Thought”, his contribution to the Chinese Communist canon, has been enshrined into the state constitution and is studied across China. He earned his PhD in Marxist theory and ideological and political education from Tsinghua University at a time when he was also governor of Fujian province, which is unlikely to have left much time to study, according to Cai Xia, a former professor at the party school who now lives in exile. “Why, unlike his predecessors, is Xi so resistant to others’ advice?” she wrote in a recent article for Foreign Affairs. “Part of the reason I suspect is that he suffers from an inferiority complex, knowing that he is poorly educated in comparison with other top CCP leaders.” His insecurities may have fuelled both paranoia and an aggression that makes it harder for him to reverse course on bad policy; his concentration of power has stifled dissent in the party that once helped thrash out ideas. A quest for total control Xi’s fear of the disintegration of the party and collapse of its rule translates into a quest for total control over everything, from the personal lives of individuals to China’s giant multinational firms, say analysts. “What strikes me most about Xi Jinping is his Stalinist way of governance, using his apparatus to purge the party, [emphasising] the party’s unified leadership and going back to the real party dictatorship,” said Jean-Philippe Béja, a research emeritus professor at Sciences Po in Paris. “No one is beyond the reach of the party.” Businesses that fuelled China’s extraordinary three decades of growth, from tech giants to tutoring companies, have in recent years found the party demanding either a stake or more oversight, installing officials and demanding party cells be set up. During Xi’s rule, the party has reached into the private sector and family lives in ways not seen since the start of the “reform and opening” era under Deng Xiaoping in 1978, meddling in details such as how much time young people can spend playing video games. The CCP’s love of control, and growing ability to monitor digital communication, has been thrown into relief by its handling of the Covid outbreak. The pandemic provided excuse and motivation to bring in an all-encompassing tracking of citizens’ lives and movements that analysts say is reminiscent of Mao-era totalitarian controls, but turbo-charged by modern technology. Xi this week said he remains committed to the zero-Covid policy of total elimination, even as the rest of the world opens up and learns to live with the virus. Like Stalin, Xi believes in party control by party institutions, making him “a more orthodox Marxist-Leninist leader than Mao”, said Bonnin. “The obvious problem is that the country might choke under such tight and rigid control.” He has upended foreign policy too, after decades of following Deng Xiaoping’s exhortation to keep a low profile – or “hide your light and bide your time”. Under Xi, China has seen rapid military expansion in the South China Sea, effectively taken control of Hong Kong, and ramped up threats against Taiwan. A cohort of aggressive “wolf warrior” foreign envoys, meanwhile, have cast aside diplomatic conventions. And in his third term there is no expectation that Xi’s ideology or principles will shift, even though he faces increasing headwinds. In Xi’s speech at the opening of the party congress on Sunday, he urged cadres to “dare to struggle” – using the word douzheng (“struggle”) that was widely used in the Mao era – and extolled “a fighting spirit” to defend national dignity and national interests amid a “turbulent” international situation. The economy is ailing amid greater state meddling and the fallout from Covid, there is domestic discontent over the handling of the pandemic, and tensions with the west have been rising for years over issues from trade to the treatment of Uyghurs. But if anything, political triumph is likely to cement Xi’s hardline instincts to protect a system that many “red princelings” like him see as both inheritance and mission. “In their eyes, the nation was fought for and won by their father’s generation,” said Song Yongyi, a US-based historian of the Cultural Revolution. “It belongs to them and their families.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T10:55:55Z","webTitle":"Blue review – racial violence, love and loss in a lyrical and angry work of unflinching power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","fields":{"bodyText":"Hugely admired in the US after its first performance at the Glimmerglass festival in 2019, Jeanine Tesori’s powerful Blue gets its UK premiere at English National Opera in a production by Tinuke Craig, conducted by Matthew Kofi Waldren. Setting a text by Tazewell Thompson, it’s an angry but lyrical work that deals unflinchingly with the impact of racial discrimination, police brutality and racially motivated violence on a Black family in present day Harlem. The narrative is horribly and tragically familiar. Tazewell’s relatively straightforward dramatic premise brings complex emotional resonances in its wake. At the work’s centre is the murder, at a peaceful protest, of a Black policeman’s son by one of his father’s white colleagues, an act that is never shown, though we witness the events that surround it. Around the time of his birth, the boy’s mother and her friends worry about his future in a prejudiced world, and years later we find father and son locked in ideological conflict over the former’s job. After the murder, there is only grief, as a painful confrontation between the father and the Reverend who fails to console him leads us to the son’s funeral. There are no easy answers to anything we have seen, and at the end an epilogue takes us back to what, we gradually realise, was the family’s last meal together. Tesori’s score largely adheres to traditional structures of arias and ensembles, though it also has a directness of expression that proves persuasive. The pace falters at the start with a meandering extended quartet for the mother and her friends, but the music gradually begins to hit home. The scene for the father and the Reverend, and an agonised aria for the mother, have considerable power. There are allusions throughout to gospel, blues and jazz, and a swerve towards oratorio in the formal hymns and rituals of the son’s funeral. Craig’s effective staging confines the action in a succession of cramped domestic interiors but uses video to take us through the streets of Harlem and chart the emergence of the political movements that drive the son on. There are blazing central performances – wonderfully sung and acted with passionate conviction – from Nadine Benjamin and Kenneth Kellogg as the mother and father. Zwakele Tshabalala is touching as the headstrong yet vulnerable son, his arguments frequently carrying the work’s intellectual and ideological weight, while Ronald Samm impresses as the Reverend, struggling to find the means to assuage a grief that is almost beyond comprehension. The smaller roles – two trios, one female, one male – are cast from strength, while Kofi Waldren conducts with considerable commitment and finesse. The playing is exemplary. • At the Coliseum, London, until 4 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T19:38:51Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Liberal to speak out for voice, Wong overruled nuclear treaty advice, Turkey ‘in shock’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone.

The Nationals leader proposes making the grocery code of conduct compulsory, boosting penalties to a “punitive” $10m maximum and adding powers to break up grocery giants in the event of misconduct. In an interview marking one year of the Albanese government, Littleproud told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that the Nationals are a “sovereign party” that will “do our own thing”. Littleproud revealed he has had “initial talks” with the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, about competition law reforms that the Coalition “were moving to [in government] but were too slow”. “The Nationals wanted to move at a lot quicker pace in terms of a compulsory grocery code. The current penalty on breaching the grocery code, which is voluntary for our big supermarkets, is about $64,000 … That’s a cost of doing business. “Let’s have punitive penalties there, $10m plus divesture powers. I think if Woolies or Coles would lose … [alcohol retail business] Dan Murphy’s because they did the wrong thing by a farmer or by a small supplier, that they’d make sure they’re playing within the guidelines of fair and equitable trade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “Because this is the problem: they have 74% of the retail market. That is a market imbalance and even the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] say that. On Friday, Coles’ supermarkets announced total group sales in the third quarter grew 6.5 per cent to $9.7 billion, with supermarket sales up 7.0 per cent to $8.6b and liquor sales rising 2.6 per cent to $801m. Outgoing CEO Steven Cain attributed the success to Coles’ home brand range, Flybuys points program and weekly special deals. Littleproud said the Nationals would like to work with the government to protect small business. “So I think there’s some reforms there that the Nationals would like to work with the government, to say let’s shift the dial on this, let’s protect small business against big supermarkets. “And it’s only regulatory. So if they’re doing the right thing, Coles, Woolies and Aldi shouldn’t care one iota. “The small supplier and particularly farmers are getting done over and this is where they just need protection. They’re not asking for charity, they’re just asking for a fair price that’s transparent to their cost of production and what it is to get on on to … their shelves and on to your plate.” On Friday the former competition watchdog head Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Leigh said he “[welcomed] bipartisanship in this important area of competition policy” after a decade in which the Coalition presided over “the worst productivity growth in the postwar era”. “As I’ve highlighted in a series of recent speeches, Australia’s economy has become increasingly dominated by a handful of big players,” he said. “Since coming to office, Labor has increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct and banned unfair contract terms. “We’re consulting on banning unfair trading practices and tackling anti-competitive behaviour in specific sectors. We’re also in the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms under the grocery code of conduct.” In a wide-ranging interview, Littleproud said at the 2022 election the Nationals had “lost a lot of voters, and particularly in the cohort of 18- to 54-year-old women and young people”. Littleproud suggested the Nationals could re-engage with these voters by advocating for childcare accessibility, regional health, and committing that “we are serious about net zero and about how we achieve it”. Littleproud echoed opposition leader Peter Dutton’s call for an investigation of small-scale modular nuclear power to help firm electricity from renewables, which the Albanese government has ruled out on cost and feasibility grounds. Littleproud defended the Nationals’ decision to come out in November in opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. In contrast to Dutton’s claims that the voice proposal lacked detail, Littleproud said “the detail has been there for some time about the principle that the prime minister would be putting to the Australian people”. Littleproud argued that Australia doesn’t “need a bigger bureaucracy, you just need a better one” to help narrow the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health and social outcomes. “The thing that I’m most disappointed in all this is that there is no ambitious goal to say, as a nation, that we will have closed the gap by 2030, 2035.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T04:34:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear subs, tax cuts, or money to raise the jobseeker rate – how would you spend Australian tax dollars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Government spending is always contentious, with every choice made being highly political.

She declined to provide more details about the offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were shelling ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow was using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces had taken back four villages near Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main target being Kherson. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fire in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply. Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russia officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have been reported to have failed in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another vessel carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team would visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the UN nuclear watchdog inspectors to reach the Zaporizhzhia plant. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the IAEA mission through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Zaporizhzhia plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventive safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counterproductive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to punish Russia for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed the French utility company Engie that it is reducing its gas deliveries owing to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in the war, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it was likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase in size by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting from January next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/mar/10/michael-caine-zulu-history-british-mythology","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T14:21:02Z","webTitle":"Michael Caine might not like it, but Zulu shows cinema’s power to rewrite history | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/10/michael-caine-zulu-history-british-mythology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/mar/10/michael-caine-zulu-history-british-mythology","fields":{"bodyText":"There’s an urban myth about a scene in Zulu in which a British officer in a red tunic is gruesomely struck in his throat by three successive spears: after a stunned silence in the cinema auditorium, a bloke is said to have shouted from the back: “One hundred and EIGHTY!” (Other versions of the story have an extra on location shouting it – and then getting fired – or even the star himself, Michael Caine.) Now the film is contending with more darts. Sir Michael Caine is furious at the news that Zulu, the 1964 film about the battle of Rorke’s Drift that made him an international star, has been named as something that could encourage far-right sympathies by the Research Information and Communications Unit, run as part of Prevent, the government’s counter-terror operation. As if to troll Sir Michael and everyone else, the unit includes on its list The Four Feathers, The Great Escape and The Dam Busters – the last one perhaps because of the name that Wing Commander Guy Gibson gives his dog. (To quote the explanation given by David Brent, “it was before racism was bad”.) But the list also includes works by Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Kipling and Edmund Burke as well as The Thick of It, Yes Minister and Michael Portillo’s Great British Railway Journeys. (Maybe we’ll let them have that last one.) But is Prevent really trying to get Zulu and all these other texts cancelled? Or is it merely recording the (perhaps mischievous) way that far-right groups solemnly invoke these things as touchstones? And could it be that Prevent’s clumsy list will cause people to watch Zulu all over again, to get a new generation to see Stanley Baker, that lion of British cinema who played Caine’s commanding officer Lt John Chard, and of course Caine himself, playing a stiff-upper-lipped posh type for the first and last time in his life? There is also Jack Hawkins as the alcoholic civilian missionary who is evacuated in a truck screaming: “You’re all going to die! Don’t you realise? Can’t you see?” It’s certainly a tricky watch, with the concept of empire now being re-examined. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift happened during the Anglo-Zulu War, caused by Britain’s invasion of Zululand in 1879. The combatants’ manpower on both sides might be said to have been about equal but the British had the cannons, breechloading rifles and Gatling guns. The Zulus were defending an unprovoked attack on their territory by an invader with superior weaponry. But the film Zulu claimed underdog status for the British by focussing on a specific event in which just 150 British soldiers held off around 4,000 Zulu warriors. The movie sentimentally imagines a final standoff in which the British and Zulus actually sing to each other, imbued with respect for each other’s martial gallantry: the Zulus a funeral lament and the British a chorus of Men of Harlech. Did director Cy Endfield consider a game of football between them on no man’s land? The movie doesn’t exactly provide the overall context: this was part of a catastrophic reverse for the British, taking into account the previous Battle of Isandlwana – to which Rorke’s Drift was a footnote – in which they were defeated despite their weaponry advantage. After Rorke’s Drift, moreover, some Zulus were hanged using a specially constructed gallows. The movie is arguably part of the cover-up mythology that began almost immediately: the seizing on and inflation of a relatively unimportant event. Undoubtedly the look and feel of Zulu inspired a film that does not feature on the Prevent list: Carry On Up the Khyber, that well-known satire of British colonialism. Perhaps the Research Information and Communications Unit could host a double-bill of these films at the Home Office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/29/australia-drops-opposition-to-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-at-un-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-28T21:59:19Z","webTitle":"Australia drops opposition to treaty banning nuclear weapons at UN vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/australia-drops-opposition-to-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-at-un-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/29/australia-drops-opposition-to-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-at-un-vote","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia has dropped its opposition to a landmark treaty banning nuclear weapons in a vote at the United Nations in New York on Saturday. While Australia was yet to actually join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the shift in its voting position to “abstain” after five years of “no” is seen by campaigners as a sign of progress given the former Coalition government repeatedly sided with the United States against it. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said through a spokesperson that Australia had “a long and proud commitment to the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime” and that the government supported the new treaty’s “ambition of a world without nuclear weapons”. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The previous Coalition government was firmly against the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a relatively new international agreement that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. Australia voted against opening negotiations on the proposed new treaty in late 2016 and did not participate in those talks in 2017. Since 2018 it has voted against annual resolutions at the UN general assembly and first committee that called on all countries to join the agreement “at the earliest possible date”. That changed early on Saturday morning when Australia shifted its voting position to abstain. Indonesia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Ireland were among countries to co-sponsor this year’s supportive UN resolution. Australia traditionally argued the treaty would not work because none of the nuclear weapons states had joined and because it “ignores the realities of the global security environment”. It also argued joining would breach the US alliance obligations, with Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia. But the treaty has gained momentum because of increasing dissatisfaction among activists and non-nuclear states about the outlook for disarmament, given that nuclear weapons states such as the US, Russia and China are in the process of modernising their arsenals. The treaty currently has 91 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it entered into force last year. The Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) had been urging Australia to vote in favour of the UN resolution on Saturday – or at least abstain in order to “end five years of opposition to the TPNW under the previous government”. Three in four members of the Labor caucus – including Anthony Albanese – have signed an Ican pledge that commits parliamentarians “to work for the signature and ratification of this landmark treaty by our respective countries”. Labor’s 2021 national platform committed the party to signing and ratifying the treaty “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. These conditions suggest the barriers to actually signing may still be high. But Gem Romuld, the Australia director of Ican, said the government was “heading in the right direction” and engaging positively with the treaty. Romuld said it “would be completely self-defeating to wait for all nuclear-armed states to get on board” before Australia joined. “Indeed, no disarmament treaty has achieved universal support and Australia has joined all the other disarmament treaties, even where our ally – the US – has not yet signed on, such as the landmine ban treaty,” Romuld said. In 2017 the US, the UK and France declared that they “do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party” to the new treaty, and the Trump administration actively lobbied countries to withdraw. Wong told the UN general assembly last month that Australia would “redouble our efforts” towards disarmament because Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"Best podcasts of the week: Trans moshpits, non-binary emo and the power of music for queer lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","fields":{"bodyText":"Picks of the week Dinner’s on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson Widely available, episodes weekly In this lofi podcast, the Modern Family star uses his contacts to bag freebie meals in New York and LA for a new guest each week.

HV There’s a podcast for that This week, Ammar Kalia chooses five of the best niche podcasts, from a deep dive into the written works of Jane Austen to a podcast about the humble pen itself Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet There is no better way to plumb the depths of obscurity than to go searching for negative reviews of strange products and places online. This long-running podcast from siblings Alex and Christine Schiefer pays hilarious tribute to the niche world of one-star reviews, providing dramatic readings of everything from screeds against suburban branches of Hooters restaurants in the US to dud strands of weed, caves, matchmaking services, and wedding chapels. It is as much an exploration into the psyche of the people who feel compelled to leave reviews as it is an unearthing of the unusual places and things they experience. Centuries of Sound Since sound recording began in the 19th century, sonic traces of our history have ranged from changing styles of music to recorded speeches, radio broadcasts and the simple bustle of background noise. British sound artist James Errington has been compiling this audio archive since starting his podcast in 2017, making immersive sound mixes of music, chatter and atmosphere for each year from the 1850s onwards. While discursive interludes provide context for the mixes, the audio itself is an engrossing guide, placing listeners directly back in the time of the music and sound’s making. The Pen Addict We might spend most of our lives glued to screens and tapping at keyboards, but there is still a satisfying pleasure in putting pen to paper and scratching away. At least, that’s the premise for this stationery-themed podcast, hosted by aficionados Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley. The pair guide listeners through the latest developments in fountain pen technology, paper stock and ballpoint design in each episode. While it might sound yawn-inducing, the show’s attention to detail is strangely fascinating; from the rarefied world of collectors to what your handwriting says about you, there’s more to our writing implements than meets the eye. The Thing About Austen A historical podcast with an ingenious route into its 18th- and 19th-century periods of study, this series from literary academics Zan Cammack and Diane Neu examines the world that surrounded the novels written by Jane Austen (pictured above). Much more than just an exploration of genteel society and marriage comedies, Cammack and Neu’s wide-ranging and gleefully nerdy discussions drill down into the smallest details from Austen’s popular texts, from Sense and Sensibility’s toothpick cases to Northanger Abbey’s muslin. By raking through Austen’s objects, Cammack and Neu discover the writer’s ingenuity and what her characters’ possessions ultimately reveal about their time and place.

Hanna Mailar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine still controlled “certain facilities” in the Litak district, but reports said the defenders had lost control of the last of the remaining high-rises in the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukraine has switched its primary focus to engaging in limited counterattacks on the higher ground to the immediate north-west and south of the ruined city, which could be used to threaten the Russian attackers below. “The offensive potential of the enemy has been significantly reduced, huge losses have been inflicted on the enemy” Mailar said. She added: “We have gained time for certain actions, which will be discussed later.” Bakhmut was first shelled in May 2022 and Russian forces consistently targeted the mining city that had a pre-war population of about 70,000. Although not considered of particular strategic value, the city has acquired a high symbolic value for both sides in the conflict. The two sides fought building by building in the most intense fighting seen in Europe since the end of the second world war, with Russia taking a year to advance about 24km on the Bakhmut sector of the eastern Donbas, a front that has otherwise remained relatively static since last autumn. The effort was led by the Russian mercenary Wagner group, using seasoned veterans to command a large number of former prisoners. But experts question whether, as the battle draws to an end, Wagner can continue to fight further. The Institute of the Study of War said on Sunday night it believed Wagner’s offensive was likely to be at its culmination point and that “it is unlikely that Wagner will continue fighting beyond Bakhmut at its current depleted state”. Joe Biden, the US president, said at the G7 summit in Japan that Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, killed and wounded, in fighting for the city, higher than previous Ukrainian estimates of 70,000. Ukraine does not release casualty figures but it is believed to have lost tens of thousands in the protracted struggle. Wagner’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declared on Saturday that Bakhmut had fallen, filming himself at the city’s battered railway station a few kilometres behind the frontline. Other video footage showed Russian troops waving flags at the western edge of the city, although not in the Litak district still being fought over. At that point, Prigozhin announced Wagner forces would withdraw from the city by Thursday, leaving its defence to regular Russian troops, although it was unclear whether that was a firm declaration of intent, or a feint designed to lure Ukrainian forces back into attacking the city. Attacking forces are often considered at their most vulnerable when an advance culminates, usually due to combat exhaustion, and Ukraine has been hinting that it hopes to surround the invaders in the city by attacking to the north and south. But the Ukrainian counterattacks remain relatively limited so far, and the expectation is that Kyiv will soon launch a more significant assault as the weather improves, using about 12 brigades-worth of troops, many of which have been equipped with western tanks, fighting vehicles and artillery. Three civilians were killed and 14 injured across Ukraine in overnight shelling while the country’s air force said it had shot down four cruise missiles and 20 drones. But the air force spokesperson Yuri Inhat said Ukraine did not “have enough means” – air defences – to deal with high-speed ballistic missiles across the country. Ukraine said it had reconnected the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its external power supply after a brief outage that had left it reliant on emergency generators. Backup diesel generators were in use for a time at the site, to ensure nuclear fuel was kept cool and prevent a potential disaster. It is the seventh time during the war that the nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, has had to switch to backup power. Russian forces seized the plant early in the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T04:55:31Z","webTitle":"What is the Aukus submarine deal and what does it mean? – the key facts ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","fields":{"bodyText":"In a tripartite deal with the US and the UK, Australia has unveiled a plan to acquire a fleet of up to eight nuclear-powered submarines, forecast to cost up to $368bn between now and the mid-2050s. Australia will spend $9bn over the next four years. From this year Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with US and UK navies, including within both countries’ submarine industrial bases. From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate their nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling near Perth as part of a push to step up training of Australians. The imperative Increased Chinese naval power and assertiveness – particularly in the South China Sea – has convinced the Australian government that it requires submarines capable of operating far from home bases, both as a deterrent and for attack capability in the event of a crisis. The current fleet of Collins class conventional submarines are expected to lose their edge from the 2030s. Nuclear-powered submarines have a distinct advantage over the diesel-electric boats of Australia’s fleet because they don’t need to surface to “snort” to recharge their batteries. Nuclear subs can leave port and stay underwater for weeks, avoiding detection. Four phases 1. Embedded personnel and port visits: Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with the the allies’ navies. US nuclear-powered submarines will increase their visits to Australian ports, with Australian sailors joining US crews for training. 2. Submarine rotations: From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines through HMAS Stirling. 3. Sale of US Virginia-class submarines: From the early 2030s – pending approval by Congress – the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines, with a potential option for two more if required. 4. SSN-Aukus: A combination of UK submarine design and US defence technology will contribute to the development of the new SSN-Aukus submarine – intended as the future attack submarine for both the UK and Australia. Both Australia and the UK intend to start building SSN-Aukus submarines in their domestic shipyards before the end of this decade. The first such boat may enter into UK service in the late 2030s, but the Australian navy will receive its first Australian-built SSN-Aukus submarine in the early 2040s. Australia will begin construction works on the shipyard required to build nuclear-powered submarines in Osborne, South Australia, this year. The US Joe Biden said the three nations stood at an “inflection point in history” argued that in “forging this new partnership, we’re showing again how democracies can deliver, how our own security and prosperity and not just for us, but for the entire world”. The US president stressed – repeatedly – that the submarines that will be part of the Aukus deal will be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state and it’s committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them.” Australia Australia’s prime minister said the Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between Australia, the US and the UK. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Anthony Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. China China responded to the announcement by saying the nuclear submarine cooperation plan was “a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region”. “The irony of Aukus is that two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state, clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT [non-proliferation treaty],” China’s mission to the UN tweeted. Nuclear waste The nuclear reactors that will power the SSN-Aukus submarines will not be built in Australia. They will arrive from either the UK or US in a welded power unit and will not require refuelling during their expected lifetime. Australia has said it will not enrich uranium or reprocess any spent fuel from the submarines. But it has committed to managing all of the radioactive waste generated by the submarines within Australia. “This includes radioactive waste with lower levels of radioactivity generated by day-to-day submarine operations and maintenance,” a government fact sheet says. “And radioactive waste with higher levels of radioactivity, including spent fuel, which is produced when submarines are decommissioned at the end of their service life.” No decision has been made on the location yet. Nuclear non-proliferation concerns The Aukus scheme is the first time a provision in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. Paragraph 14 allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium – the core of a nuclear weapon – from international oversight. James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there was “real and concrete harm done” to the non-proliferation regime. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.” The Winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Australia’s decision to buy and build nuclear-powered submarines was both a major proliferation risk and could be seen internationally as a precursor to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Ican urged Australia to sign the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons: the ban Ican has championed and to which 68 states around the world are now a party. The Australian government counters that it has no intention of seeking nuclear weapons, and adds: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” Jobs The Australian government estimates the nuclear submarine program will need 20,000 jobs over the next 30 years, within the ADF, the domestic ship-building industry and the public service. The government forecasts 8,500 will be directly employed in Australia’s building and servicing of the submarines, including scientists, engineers, project managers, construction workers, electricians, fitters and builders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T14:44:28Z","webTitle":"Harrison Birtwistle tribute – music of power and beauty as Sinfonietta remember a great friendship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","fields":{"bodyText":"The relationship between Harrison Birtwistle and the London Sinfonietta spanned more than half a century, and took in more than 30 premieres and performances in 28 countries. The orchestra’s tribute to the great composer, who died 11 months ago, was generous and sincere – a concert conducted by Martyn Brabbins that included both the first and last of the large-scale ensemble works that the Sinfonietta introduced, and which also involved musicians from the Manson Ensemble of the Royal Academy of Music, where Birtwistle studied clarinet in the late 1950s, a connection that he renewed at the end of his life. And, with the news of the sudden death three days earlier of Nicholas Snowman, co-founder of the Sinfonietta, who was a close friend of Birtwistle and a steadfast champion of his music, the occasion had taken on an extra poignancy. Snowman in fact commissioned the earliest piece in this programme, Verses for Ensembles, which the Sinfonietta first performed in 1969. With its block-like construction, raw, uncompromising soundworld of wind instruments and percussion, and mysterious elements of ritual as the instrumentalists move around the platform, Verses remains in many respects the archetypal Birtwistle score, and, as Brabbins’s performance showed, it has lost none of its excoriating power, derived in large part from its debts to Stravinsky and Varèse. Birtwistle observed that he always felt he was composing the same piece, exploring different facets in turn of one block of musical material, but how his music evolved was shown by the ensemble piece here from the other end of his career, In Broken Images, from 2011. The musical blocks by then have smoother edges, their rawness is tempered by a group of strings, and the argument is less static, more in a continuous process of development, while its rhetorical power remains intact. On occasions like this, one always wants to hear more pieces than a single concert can contain, but it seemed a pity that the programme began with a couple of miniatures, the “conversation for two instruments” Duet 1, and Virelai, an arrangement of a 14th-century work by Johannes Ciconia, rather than a more muscular piece. There was room however for one of Birtwistle’s most beautiful scores, The Fields of Sorrow, a setting of a brief Latin text by Ausonius for two sopranos (Abigail Sinclair and Lisa Dafydd) and chamber choir (Londinium), with two pianos and the inevitable wind instruments creating fragile, mysterious textures around them. Here, between the more strident pieces, were a few minutes of perfect tranquillity. This article was amended on 9 March. The word ‘fulsome’ was changed to ‘generous’."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T18:59:25Z","webTitle":"Howard ministers considered extinguishing native title over SA site earmarked for nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"bodyText":"John Howard’s government considered extinguishing native title over a South Australian site earmarked for a nuclear waste dump “by agreement or by compulsory acquisition”, the 2002 cabinet papers reveal. The records, released on Sunday by the National Archives of Australia, shed light on the Howard government’s part in the decades-long battle to create a national storage site for Australia’s low- and medium-level nuclear waste. The Keating government began searching for a site to store the nation’s nuclear waste as early as 1992. In 2012 the Gillard government passed a controversial bill to create the nation’s first nuclear waste dump – saying it hadn’t yet decided on a location, although many believed it was destined for remote Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Now preliminary works have started on a site at Napandee, near Kimba in South Australia, after the Morrison government resources minister Keith Pitt declared native title had been extinguished there. The legal and political obstacles were apparent in 2002 when the finance minister, Nick Minchin, and science minister, Peter McGauran, brought their submission to cabinet. They proposed that federal laws should be used to override SA laws that would ban the establishment of a dump, and that Indigenous land use agreements could be used to override native title. If native title parties had not “agreed to the surrender of their native title through an ILUA”, the government should consider compulsory acquisition, they said. Cabinet noted that “the extinguishing of native title, whether by agreement or by compulsory acquisition, is likely to raise difficult issues”. The cabinet submission noted there were “strong imperatives” for “the safe keeping of hazardous radioactive waste materials” that arise from medicine, industry and research. The waste is now stored at Lucas Heights outside Sydney, and more than 100 institutions across the country. “Given the sensitivity of the project and the need for certainty of tenure that provides exclusive use of the site for the duration of the project, there appears to be no practical alternative to the extinguishment of native title,” the submission said. But the government would need to provide “benefits” in return, and be prepared for legal challenges. The submission also suggested a media strategy, saying that ruling out having intermediate waste (leaving just low-level waste) would “deprive the SA government of the argument the national repository was the thin end of the wedge, and that the government has a hidden agenda to site the national intermediate waste store in the state”. The current government plan is to use the Napandee site as permanent storage for low-level waste, and temporary storage for intermediate-level waste (the long-term plan for the intermediate waste is not clear). The prime minister’s department agreed with the 2002 plan, while the Attorney General’s Department supported it, but said there was not enough information to work out whether “security measures will be sufficient to prevent access to the repository for the purpose of terrorist or other criminal activity”. The Department of Foreign Affairs warned of the “distinct” possibility of “dirty bombs”, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. A dirty bomb is where an explosive is used to scatter radioactive dust. The Department of Defence had “serious concerns” about the initial proposal to use Woomera for storage. “A principal concern is the risk of a weapon impact on the national repository as well as the negative publicity that would result,” the department said. The traditional owners of the Napandee site, the Barngarla people, are still fighting the federal government in court. The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, has said he supports their cause. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, has said the waste “cannot continue to build up”, and has committed to working with the Barngarla people to protect the site’s cultural heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T16:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘It is one minute before midnight’: the view from Germany’s industrial heartland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","fields":{"bodyText":"The winding route through the German countryside from Stuttgart to the small town of Mulfingen gives few clues that this south-west region is home to several companies that are global market leaders in their field. But north-east Baden-Württemberg boasts several successful specialist firms which make up the Mittelstand, the base of small and medium-sized engineering businesses that are the backbone of the German economy and are envied around the world. The fan and ventilator manufacturer ebm-papst is still headquartered in Mulfingen – a town with a population of about 3,600 – but its products are found all over the world in cars, household appliances and datacentres. However, the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, combined with labour shortages and post-pandemic disruption to supply chains, is piling pressure on these businesses, which are traditionally family-owned – and without the deep pockets enjoyed by Germany’s corporate giants. With Germany braced for recession this year, how this industrial heartland responds and adapts to the multiple crises will help shape not just the country’s future but wider eurozone, too. Germany is forecast to be the third worst-performing G20 country (-0.3%) this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Russia and the UK. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of Germany’s economy, more than double 9% seen in the UK and France, and well ahead of Italy’s 15%. The biggest industrial employer in the region, about 4,000 work for ebm-papst in Mulfingen, the majority producing fans and motors for ventilation, refrigeration and air-conditioning technology. Founded in 1963 by Gerhard Sturm, the company, which calls itself a “hidden champion”, remains family-owned but has been run for the last year by the chief executive, Klaus Geißdörfer. Under his leadership, the company decided to end the production of fans for cars. Instead it has switched staff to focus on new technologies, such as making ventilators for heat pumps and fans to cool datacentres. “We said that we’d better focus on the things where we really are the best in the world,” says Geißdörfer from his office at ebm-papst’s headquarters. “We decided to significantly increase our capacities, which we will ramp up next year, because at the moment we are not able to follow demand.” Despite profiting from booming sales in fans for renewable technologies, the past few years have not been plain sailing for ebm-papst. Covid lockdowns in China and the resulting supply chain disruption occasionally brought its German production lines to a halt, which Geißdörfer says “makes no sense”. As a result, the company has worked to source more parts locally, close to its big factories in Germany, as well as in the US and China. Just down the road in this economic heartland are the headquarters of the almost 80-year-old screw and fastener maker Würth, which sits near Bürkert, a manufacturer of measurement and control systems for liquids and gases. These companies have helped south Germany become an industrial powerhouse, bringing prosperity and a sense of local pride to the area. “The region has lots of world market leaders,” says Donata Lell, who runs a local guesthouse and restaurant. She believes the industrial base boosts her customers’ spending power: “People here earn more money.” Geißdörfer, who hails from neighbouring Bavaria, is convinced the small community of Mulfingen is a good place to run a manufacturing business. “We have smart people here. I like the spirit people have here, they are very enthusiastic,” he says. But does the company have enough of those people for it to meet growing demand? Despite Geißdörfer’s positivity, ebm-papst has difficulties finding staff with the right skills, as well as problems getting hold of components, such as semiconductors. Ebm-papst has tried to solve its worker shortage by offering some remote working to staff in administrative roles, plus free bus travel to work for employees who live within a 40km (25 mile) radius, a perk currently used by about 1,500 people. Amid the company’s cost pressures, and higher prices demanded by its suppliers, staff say they are struggling with the cost of living crisis. Employees on the factory floor have raised their personal financial difficulties directly with Geißdörfer. “I had people coming to me and saying ‘I cannot buy any Christmas presents for my children any more’,” he says. “I talk to people, and they say, ‘I cannot afford vacations any more’.” During the summer the company paid staff an extra €2,500 in cost of living payments, made in five monthly €500 instalments from October onwards. “We stay close together with our people, and we support them in tough times and we go through crises together and try to find a way to handle it,” Geißdörfer says, describing this as a strength of the Mittelstand. “That’s the positive thing with this kind of family business structure we have in Germany. I see also other companies doing similar things.” Yet that might not be enough. The IG Metall metalworkers’ trade union, the country’s largest, already represents workers at ebm-papst’s other manufacturing sites in Germany, but not at its main site in Mulfingen, as a result of a historic work agreement. It is working to get its foot in the door there too, says Uwe Bauer, IG Metall’s representative for the Schwäbisch Hall region. Bauer says the union has recruited several hundred members in Mulfingen in recent months, as workers realise full employment locally has created “an employees’ market”. “Businesses have to rethink what to do about skilled workers,” Bauer says. “We get a lot of requests about which companies are bound by collective wage agreements. Wages play a role, but so do regular working hours,” Bauer says. Ebm-papst’s pay offer nationally is broadly in line with the collective wage agreement deal struck between IG Metall and employers in Baden-Württemberg in late November, although the workers in Mulfingen are not subject to this agreement. The pay deal, which sets the benchmark for wage increases for almost 4m metal and electrical sector workers across Germany, increases workers’ wages by 5.2% from June and 3.3% from May 2024. In addition, they will also receive a €3,000 “inflation bonus”, as the union calls it, which is tax-free and payable in two instalments in March 2023 and 2024. The agreement is generous by historical standards, but still drew some criticism for coming in below inflation, when the annual rate stood at 10% in November, according to official statistics. While pay matters are settled for now, sourcing parts remains a challenge amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips since the start of the pandemic. In the race to obtain these vital components, Mittelstand firms find themselves unable to compete financially with the country’s largest manufacturers, particularly carmakers. “As a company we can grow faster if we can get more semiconductors,” says Geißdörfer. “Somehow, we compete. But the industry is competing with the automotive industry, the solar industry and the renewable energy industry, and we all need the same kind of electronics.” The government should do more to support the country’s vital network of small and medium-sized companies, he says, particularly with soaring energy costs, which Geißdörfer believes are making European companies globally uncompetitive compared with Asian or American rivals. Recent falls in wholesale energy prices have offered only a glimmer of hope. “I really have worries about German smaller and mid-sized companies that heavily depend on energy. They have real problems at the moment to work to face those huge energy costs increases.” While he welcomes government support with energy bills, Geißdörfer and other Mittelstand bosses fear Berlin does not have a clear industrial strategy, particularly while it weans the country off cheap Russian gas. Angela Merkel’s government’s decision to turn off its nuclear power plants after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan has left it exposed to the Kremlin’s weaponisation of gas. “In Germany, we need to reinvent ourselves,” says Geißdörfer, acknowledging the geopolitical challenges, including the energy transition, and Brexit. “We are still strong enough to have sufficient money and we can afford it, but we need to do this fast, to think about how to have a stable economy going forward. But it is one minute before midnight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T18:17:09Z","webTitle":"Biden denounces Putin’s nuclear threats as ‘reckless’ in UN address","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s partial mobilisation and planned annexation of more Ukrainian regions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also shrugged off Putin’s moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counter-offensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. “We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Zelenskiy said in a pre-recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly, which Russia had tried to stop but was overwhelmingly voted down by member states. “Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine … It wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilisation at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war because it will be even hotter than the war now.” Both Biden and Zelenskiy sought to deepen Russia’s isolation, on a day when North Korea said it would not supply ammunition to Russian forces. In his speech to the general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called “reckless” threats and “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that Moscow had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. A senior US administration official said the US would not lessen its commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. The official said Putin’s latest actions were an “act of weakness” that showed his “desperation”. “This is another episode in what has been a series of episodes over the course of this war where Putin is trying to rattle his sabre trying to scare us off,” the senior official said. “He has not succeeded before – he won’t succeed now, but that doesn’t mean that we’re blind to the dynamics that could relate to escalation and that we weren’t thinking carefully through in close consultation with our allies and with Ukrainians how we would deal with that.” Biden portrayed the Russian leader and his “imperial ambitions” as a threat to the founding values of the UN, seeking to consolidate Ukraine’s global support and coax some developing countries away from their neutral stance, as Putin raised the stakes. “This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,” Biden said. “Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.” In his speech, Zelenskiy reminded world leaders of the mass graves being exhumed in the recently liberated town of Izium as the general assembly gathered, saying that among the bodies was a man strangled with a rope, and another who had been castrated before the murder. The Ukrainian president said that was not the first of such atrocities. He told the global assembly: “Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?” As Zelenskiy was speaking, a rare bit of good news emerged from the conflict: a prisoner swap in which Russia released 215 Ukrainian soldiers – many of whom had fought a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol in May – in exchange for 55 Russians and Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and oligarch who had taken sides with the Russian invaders. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, thanked the Ukrainian government for including two US citizens among 10 foreign fighters it asked to be freed as part of the swap, and also thanked Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for facilitating the deal. The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, dismissed Putin’s threats, telling the UN assembly late on Wednesdy: “We have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. “He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.” Earlier on Wednesday, Putin had delivered a highly anticipated televised address to declare a “partial mobilisation”, which he claimed was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which he said wanted “to destroy our country” and was trying to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that will apply to “those with previous military experience”. The announcement triggered an exodus of Russian men scrambling to avoid the draft. Air tickets rose in price and were soon sold out. Russian opposition groups called for nationwide anti-war street protests and by Wednesday evening, more than 1,300 people had been arrested at the demonstrations, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info. “Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation is an act of desperation,” the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Twitter. “Russia cannot win this criminal war. Putin has underestimated the situation from the outset – including the will to resist of Ukraine and the resolve shown by its friends.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there had been no perceived change in the deployment Russian nuclear forces. “The most important thing is to prevent that from happening, and that’s the reason why we have been so clear in our communications with Russia about the unprecedented consequences, about the fact that the nuclear war cannot be won by Russia,” Stoltenberg told Reuters. Putin’s announcement came a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold “referendums” this weekend on becoming part of Russia. In his speech, Putin gave support to those ballots in the parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia runder Russian control. He also delivered barely veiled nuclear threats against Nato, saying: “I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of Nato countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal.” Putin added: “It’s not a bluff.” The Russian leader and his senior officials have made a string of similar nuclear threats since launching the invasion in February, in an effort to deter Nato countries from intervening. But in his UN speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to make clear the US and its allies would not be deterred from supporting Ukraine’s fight to defend its territory. “Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations charter, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force,” Biden said. “The Kremlin is organising a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the UN charter. This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. “Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime,” he said, adding that such “irresponsible nuclear threats” directly contradicted Russia’s international responsibilities and its agreement with a joint statement by nuclear weapons powers at the beginning of this year that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Seeking support from the developing world in what he framed as a contest between democracy and dictatorship, Biden offered US support for reform of the UN security council to make it more inclusive as well asbillion of dollars for global food security and efforts to curb disease. US officials have conceded that their focus on Ukraine has led some developing countries from the global south to feel that their concerns were being ignored in a great power showdown. In his speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to address those fears, pledging $2.9bn for food security this year, and $6bn for the global fund to fight Aids tuberculosis and malaria. He also threw US support behind a longstanding demand for a more inclusive and representative security council with more permanent and non-permanent members, including permanent seats for countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T01:51:49Z","webTitle":"UN calls for demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,” Grossi said. Guterres said that, as a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces should cease all military operations around the plant. “As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he added. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offered qualified support for Grossi’s proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the plant and asked for more detail on the plan. “If the content of this proposal is to demilitarise the territory of the nuclear power plant – and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarised protection zone,” he said. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, blamed recent shelling of the plant on Ukraine and portrayed Russian forces as protecting the plant. He did not respond to the call for a security zone, a proposal Moscow has so far rejected. Nebenzya said he had not had time to read the IAEA report. The IAEA report presented on Tuesday said the agency was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. The report came as a Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. “Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainewas behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. At least two Ukrainians collaborating with the Russian government were killed in suspected partisan attacks in August. In one case, the deputy head of the Russian-installed military administration was shot to death in his home in the city of Nova Kakhovka. In late August, a Ukrainian politician from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party who had gone over to work with the Russians was killed in the Kherson region. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the security council the Zaporizhzhia staff were “no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.” Russian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity, prompting fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility and the report did not ascribe blame for the damage its inspectors had discovered. The UN agency sent a 14-person team to the site last week, including its director general, Rafael Grossi, to assess the situation at the plant. At least two members of the team are to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility’s safety. “There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said. “This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities.” The IAEA said that, during its inspection, its team “closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant, in particular on 3 September when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the administrative building”. On the same day, the plant was disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line. “While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. Grossi is expected to brief the UN security council in New York on his findings later on Tuesday. Earlier, blasts rang out and power was cut in Enerhodar, the city surrounding the plant, according to Dmytro Orlov, the Ukrainian mayor who operates from outside Russian-held territory. Moscow repeated its longstanding accusations that Ukrainian forces had been shelling the plant. Kyiv says it is Russia that has been staging such incidents, to undermine international support for Ukraine and as a possible pretext to cut the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and steal its output. On the battleground in the east of the country on Tuesday, three civilians were killed in Russian rocket attacks in the Kharkiv region, a senior official said. In the past week the focus of fighting has shifted to the south, where Ukraine has started a long-awaited counterattack to recapture territory seized early in the war.

Humza Yousaf – who has billed himself as the continuity candidate, the torchbearer for Nicola Sturgeon’s liberal agenda – came through in the end, although by a tighter margin than any new leader of a party would want. Those members for whom Kate Forbes’s views on sexual and LGBTQ+ equality were a red line – and who had pledged to tear up their membership cards if she was victorious – can breathe a sigh of relief. Ditto the wider central belt, left-of-the-party supporters, who had viewed the prospect of a fiscal and social lurch to the right with dismay. It’s true that with Yousaf there will be less immediate upheaval. As the “establishment” candidate, he already has the support of the majority of MSPs and ministers. He will find it easier than Forbes would have done to form a cabinet, and his election makes it unlikely the Greens will walk out of their powersharing deal, as they had already threatened to do if Forbes became first minister. But there are downsides to Yousaf’s victory, too, both for the party and the country. If there is one thing Forbes was right about, it is that “continuity won’t cut it”. Yousaf cannot just pick up where his predecessor left off. It was a growing recognition that the Salmond/Sturgeon era had run out of steam that led to her resignation. The divisions within the party, and the miasma of failure around it, have only increased as a result of a bitterly fought contest and a relentless succession of bad news stories, something that is evident in the tight result. Yousaf will take the helm with little of the goodwill that accompanied Sturgeon’s 2014 anointment. That she was able to unite such an ideologically disparate party was due in part to her popularity and control freak tendencies, and in part to a tacit agreement to “wheesht for indy” – that is, to suppress dissent in the service of the greater cause of independence. With no second referendum on the horizon, and Sturgeon out of the picture, the cork has popped off the bottle and will not be forced back in. Yousaf inherits a party where most of the big figures of the Sturgeon era – John Swinney, Jeane Freeman and chief executive, Peter Murrell – have departed, and one which faces a barrage of internal and external questions over its integrity and transparency. The clamour for answers has become louder in recent weeks, thanks to the Holyrood public audit committee’s damning report into the CalMac ferries scandal – which revealed the waste of taxpayers’ money running into the millions – and the revelation that the party had misled the media over a 30,000 drop in membership figures. And, of course, there is still the police probe into the £600,000 of funds said to have gone missing from the party’s accounts (the party has not responded to the allegation, due to the ongoing investigation). That Yousaf was at the heart of the SNP as its culture of complacency grew – that he either failed to notice or turned a blind eye to it – makes it harder for him to convincingly promise a reset. In addition, Yousaf’s competency for the top job is doubted even by some of those who voted for him. As justice secretary, he presided over the widely derided hate crime bill, and during his tenure as health secretary waiting times for hospital treatment soared. The crisis that has engulfed the NHS must be the new first minister’s top priority. But one might wonder how the man who was in charge of it as it declined is going to find new ideas and resources to fix it now. It is clear from his campaign that Yousaf understands the disappointment many supporters feel about the SNP’s failure to improve the lives of the marginalised. His openness to introducing new taxes for the wealthy is preferable to Forbes’s more conservative economic bent. And yet his pledge to hold a summit for anti-poverty groups has all the hallmarks of the same old, same old: setting up yet another talking shop instead of taking action. Meanwhile, his predisposition to fight the UK government on its section 35 obstruction of the SNP’s gender recognition reform bill may be exactly what the progressives who voted for him want; but it will also rekindle the divisions that helped force his predecessor’s exit. As for the opposition parties, they denigrated Sturgeon’s achievements during her final first minister’s questions last week. But they know the departure of such a formidable figure opens up fresh opportunities. One of the quirks of the contest was that many unionist activists and commentators seemed to be lobbying for Forbes, which suggests they thought a victory for her would most boost their own position. But the Greens would have been the likely beneficiaries of a mass exit of “woke” members, and Forbes might have proved a challenging adversary across the chamber. It is impossible yet to know if Scottish Labour will rise to the occasion and capitalise on the widening faultlines within the SNP. But it is worth noting that there are long-term supporters within the party who believe the best thing that could happen to it would be a term out of office; and that Yousaf as first minister might be the best way to achieve it.

This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Canary Wharf offices and retail spaces to be powered by Scottish windfarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","fields":{"bodyText":"Offices and retail spaces across the Canary Wharf business district will soon be powered by clean energy generated by a windfarm in Scotland. Canary Wharf Group, which manages the 60-hectare (150 acres) estate in east London, has struck a deal with one of the world’s biggest providers of renewable energy to meet almost three-quarters of its electricity demand from wind power. The deal is expected to help some of the UK’s biggest corporate names occupying office space in Canary Wharf – including EY, HSBC and BP – to cut their emissions while reducing their energy costs. Brookfield, an asset manager chaired by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, will provide Canary Wharf with green energy. The company, one of the world’s largest investors in renewable power, will do so by growing its renewables portfolio with the development of a new onshore windfarm in Scotland, which is due to begin generating electricity from 2026. The estate manager has bought renewable electricity for the business district from energy suppliers since 2012 but the deal with Brookfield is the first time it will source its clean electricity directly from a renewable energy project. The 15-year agreement could be extended to supply all of Canary Wharf’s 18m sq ft of office, retail and leisure spaces with 100% renewable electricity, according to Shobi Khan, the chief executive of Canary Wharf Group. Khan told the Guardian that the deal took three years to agree but should help to reduce electricity bills by about 50% compared with using power generated by gas power plants. The deal is part of a wider campaign to transform the estate into a sustainability leader, he said. “The point is to not only do something good for the environment but have it make good business sense, too,” Khan added. Brookfield has used its global portfolio of about 25,000 megawatts of renewable energy – the equivalent of all the UK’s onshore and offshore windfarms combined – to strike clean energy supply deals with about 700 corporate customers. The Canadian asset manager’s real estate investment arm also owns a 50% stake in Canary Wharf, which it acquired in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-11T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘Her writing became a catalyst for my own’: the power of Sylvia Plath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","fields":{"bodyText":"A few years ago a friend sent me a photo of himself wearing a Sylvia Plath T-shirt. It was pale pink – the colour of the Smith College memorandum paper on which the poet drafted many of her poems – and printed with the iconic picture of Plath in side profile, wearing a white hairband. I thought it was the greatest thing I’d ever seen. I am one of countless poets who developed an obsession with Sylvia Plath after being introduced to her work as a teenager, and her writing became a catalyst for my own. I recited her poems out loud in my bedroom, just as I would sing along to my favourite songs. The poems’ cadences sank into me, the way Plath sank into my own personal mythology, long before any other writers did. Beyond the power of her work, what Sylvia Plath represented to me is still hard to understand. On a personal level I felt a kinship with her because we had both lost parents as children (she, her father at eight; me, my mother at seven). We had both received sharp, early lessons in the savagery of the world. Such lessons are, of course, not unusual. Most teenagers, despite their backgrounds, have a sense of this savagery. Perhaps that’s why Plath’s work so often hits home in those years, when one is beginning to reckon with life’s difficulties and work out how, if, one might harness them. Ariel, Plath’s final, posthumously published collection of poems, shows us how. Understandably, these poems have often been interpreted in the light, or shadow, of her oncoming death. Sylvia Plath died of suicide 60 years ago today, at the age of 30. The circumstances around her death have been described, fictionalised, analysed – sometimes sensitively, more often voyeuristically – in biographies, memoirs, films and literature. Posterity loves a tragic female artist, a tendency that Plath’s daughter Frieda Hughes rightly objected to in My Mother, a furious poem written in response to the 2003 film about her parents, Ted and Sylvia. Its final lines read: They think I should love it – Having her back again, they think I should give them my mother’s words To fill the mouth of their monster, Their Sylvia Suicide Doll, Who will walk and talk And die at will, And die, and die And forever be dying. A death, however tragic, is only a very small part of a life. There is in fact incredible vigour and energy in Plath’s poems. Despite the anguish that powered its writing, Ariel is full of bright, glittering images, “electrifyingly-colored sherbets”, flowers of astonishing redness, and its soundtrack is hoofbeats. I read these things as symbols of the poet’s irrepressible life force, not her illness. Plath’s most recent biographer, Heather Clark, sought to make the poet’s life, not her death, the driving force of her book. Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath, a title taken from Plath’s poem Stings, captures perfectly the reasons why we should remember her. “Comet” comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “long-haired star”, an image that calls to mind the ending of Plath’s Lady Lazarus, a poem about coming back from the dead: “Out of the ash / I rise with my red hair’. Stings uses the metaphor of a beehive and its queen bee to describe a kind of renaissance of the self. The poet writes: “They thought death was worth it, but I / Have a self to recover, a queen.” As we memorialise Sylvia Plath on the anniversary of her death, we should honour this spirit of resurrection – and recover a queen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T12:51:53Z","webTitle":"Johnson takes swipe at Truss plans for fracking and North Sea drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift a ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The comments will be viewed as a jibe at Truss, who last week pledged to “end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking”, and is said to want to issue up to 130 new drilling licences for oil and gas companies to explore new fields in the North Sea. Reflecting on his future, Johnson said he was “ready to get on with life”, and he refused to be drawn on whether he would disappear quickly from politics, like David Cameron, or remain on the backbenches, as Theresa May has done. “Only time will tell, is my answer on that one,” he replied. “My intention – and what I certainly will do – is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me.” Johnson also evaded questions on whether he had any regrets about his premiership, saying he would leave it to “younger, fitter, more active journalists than me” to assess. Pressed on what message he had for people worried about paying their energy bills this winter amid rising inflation and the threat of a recession, he said people should be braced for a “very tough winter and we just have to accept that”. “We’re on your side,” he insisted, adding there would be a further package of support from the next prime minister, who will be announced next Monday and will take office the following day. The “future will be better when we’re more self-reliant” and less dependent on energy imports, Johnson predicted. After being accused by Rishi Sunak of ignoring the harms of lockdown during the Covid pandemic, Johnson said the criticism that it had caused the huge backlog of NHS surgery was an “inversion of logic”. Instead, he said, the opposite was the case; if the three national lockdowns had not been ordered, the NHS would be in an “even worse” position. Johnson will travel to meet the Queen in Balmoral to formally resign next Tuesday, with his successor formally appointed shortly after. The new prime minister will return to London to appoint a cabinet, and will then face questions in the Commons on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"Stretching his 15 minutes of fame: why Andy Warhol still has the power to inspire ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","fields":{"bodyText":"When he appears in Nicole Flattery’s recently published novel Nothing Special, Andy Warhol is a spectral presence. “I never saw him come in but I felt the atmosphere change when he did,” Flattery writes from the watchful point of view of the teenage narrator of the book. The coming-of-age novel set in the mid 1960s, with some flashes into the present, follows Mae, a lonely teenager who drops out of school after finding herself drawn into the new world of Warhol’s storied Factory in Manhattan. While art and drama and debauchery happen around her among the artist and his acolytes, Mae has the more prosaic job of typist. She is transcribing recordings of conversations that will form the basis of a: A Novel, Warhol’s (real) experimental book from 1968. “I feel things work if you just don’t often see that person,” Flattery says of her version of Warhol. “It’s in their interest to remain out of your eyeline. They’ll only have the power if they make themselves like a distant, inaccessible figure.” Flattery’s reimagining of Warhol might see him as distant, but 36 years after his death, he is ever-present in the public’s imagination. In fact, the recent obsession with him in theatre, film and books can make it seem as though you are never more than 6ft away from a Warhol-related event. Opening on 31 March at London’s Fashion and Textile museum is Andy Warhol: The Textiles, a survey of his lesser-seen textile designs made in his time as a successful commercial artist in the 1950s and early 60s. In April, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris will launch a show of the mid-1980s paintings he made with Jean-Michel Basquiat. Last year The Collaboration, Anthony McCarten’s play, which premiered at the Young Vic and later transferred to New York, explored the relationship between the two artists – a film version, directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, is in the works. Last year also brought a high-profile six-part documentary series on Netflix made by Ryan Murphy, based on Warhol’s diaries, which were published posthumously in 1989. At last September’s New York fashion week, Tommy Hilfiger’s catwalk show was indebted to the artist. Perhaps we are seeing the long tail of his incessant industriousness and boundless influence. “Warhol is omnipresent. Somehow he seems to, in this digital, internet age, strike a chord with people,” says Richard Chamberlain, co-curator of the textiles exhibition, and co-author of the book Pop: Design, Culture, Fashion 1956-1976. “I think his subject matter, although it can be quite deep and thought-provoking, is quite accessible. And there’s so much about the man and what he was involved with, which is interesting to people.” Flattery says that she was particularly influenced by the artist’s experimental films from the 1960s. The Hilfiger fashion week show also called on the Factory years, with broader nods to Warhol’s silver clouds installation, his superstar muses and his nous for branding. The pair were friends in the 1980s – “you could say it is a meeting of preppy minds” Hilfiger said in September. Anything that draws on the Factory is immediately evocative of the era. It was in the mid-1960s when a Warhol look first solidified in the public consciousness: jeans and a Breton or black top, with a leather jacket and sunglasses, all presented with an inscrutable gaze. The move away from the homogeneity of the 1950s into an outfit of the counterculture isn’t unique to Warhol. “To me, it’s a perennial popularity of mid-1960s bohemian modernist style,” says Nathanial Weiner, lecturer in cultural studies at Central Saint Martins, London . “People really liked that era, because it’s sort of the pinnacle, almost of western casual dress.” After he was shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968, Warhol withdrew from some of the free-wheeling aspects of the Factory, and honed his outfits into a more toned-down uniform of blue jeans and shirt, blazer and tie. It managed to seem both unremarkably plain, yet uniquely Warholian. Andy the worker. His life and work started to revolve around more established versions of celebrity, rather than around his own creations. By the 1980s Warhol was often clad all in black, in jeans, polo neck and a jacket, with New Balance or white Reebok Classic trainers. Ever more rake-thin and with his silver-blonde wig at its most shocking, this is a stark vision of Warhol – perhaps indicative of a scramble for relevancy in his friendship with then up-and-coming art star Jean-Michel Basquiat. This latter look, particularly the hair, has become a signifier of Warhol. It is the version that actor Paul Bettany plays in The Collaboration. David Bowie performed it in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 Basquiat biopic. “I really didn’t want him to overshadow the book,” says Nicole Flattery of Nothing Special. “I could go back through the appearances of Andy Warhol in films: he’s in the film The Doors [played by Crispin Glover] and Factory Girl [played by Guy Pearce]. I feel with a presence like that, if you don’t get it fully right it can really mess up everything.” It’s not just his look but also his personal life that seems to continue to capture people’s imagination. “I thought that the recent mini-series, The Andy Warhol Diaries, was very interesting,” says Scott King, a graphic designer and creator of The Debrist Manifesto, a book on art-world failure and the pursuit of perfectionism. “It showed him as an active participant in love and disappointment and – quite boring-looking – weekends away in the Hamptons. It humanised him and showed a tenderness, a sadness. I mean, the best work he made was incredibly melancholic wasn’t it? But we don’t usually associate him with tenderness.” But, as photographer Nat Finklestein’s 1999 book The Factory Years displays, Warhol and his 1960s coterie had already long since created a vision of indelible debauched cool. “The Warhol stance,” says Chamberlain, “the very sort of hip, Velvet Underground attitudes, that is still very refreshing, and very vital to people. I think there is a Warhol that still has an edginess.” Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T09:58:46Z","webTitle":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/oct/05/battersea-power-station-timeline-of-a-modern-classic","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Battersea power station: timeline of a modern classic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/05/battersea-power-station-timeline-of-a-modern-classic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/05/battersea-power-station-timeline-of-a-modern-classic","fields":{"bodyText":"Battersea power station was built in two phases, as a collaboration between the architects Theo Halliday and Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.

Rumors on social media suggest that the attack was carried out to stop a local drag show. But officials have said a motive for the attack is unknown. Two power stations were struck with gunfire on Saturday at about 7pm eastern time, causing tens of thousands of residents to go without electricity, the Associated Press reported. The power outage affected Moore county, which is about two hours outside Charlotte. Authorities began investigating the outage as a crime after utility workers found signs of vandalism at the power grid, including evidence of gunfire at two substations, reported CNN. The Moore county sheriff, Ronnie Fields, described the investigation into the power outage during a Sunday news conference, reporting that “someone opened fire on the substation, the same thing with the other one”. Fields added that state investigators were also working with the FBI to find out who is responsible. “The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields said. But “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept that they’re the ones that done it”, Fields added, saying that officials are looking into different possibilities. As of Monday morning, almost 30,000 people were still without power, according to Duke Energy, an energy provider for the area. Local government officials have also acknowledged the attack. The North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, spoke about the power grid’s targeting on Twitter, writing: “An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.” North Carolina state senator Tom McInnis called the attack a “terrible act” that seemed to be malicious, the New York Times reported. Authorities opened at least one shelter running on a power generator and imposed a nightly curfew after the outage, the Times added. Schools in the county were also closed on Monday. It wasn’t immediately clear how long it would be before campuses reopened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T19:26:57Z","webTitle":"Dykes scores hat-trick on league debut as London Irish power past Harlequins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"London Irish already have an impressive roster of exciting young English-qualified talent and another name can now be added to the list. Michael Dykes has plenty of good rugby ahead of him but an alert hat-trick of tries on his Premiership debut ensured he overshadowed even the fit-again Henry Arundell on a highly encouraging day for the Exiles. There are fruit machines that revolve slower than the helter-skelter games in which Irish specialise but here there was also a decent pay-out to enjoy as they bolstered their chances of a top-four finish with a convincing bonus-point victory. If a first-half red card for the Quins captain, Stephan Lewies, significantly shaped the contest, the hosts fully deserved their six-try success. Along with the energy of the 21-year-old Dykes, who is from Berkshire and has already represented England at age-group level, the sight of Arundell back on a rugby field for the first time since late October was another clear plus for the Exiles in a season which has too often involved narrow defeats and red cards. England, with Henry Slade now out with a hip injury, have recalled Leicester’s Anthony Watson to their Six Nations squad but the Irish head coach, Les Kiss, suggested Arundell would also be ready if and when he is required. “I wouldn’t be afraid to throw him in,” Kiss said. “The boy’s got something special.” Here, too, was a glimpse of what might yet be possible this season for Irish, who have now won four of their past five Premiership games. If a nasty-looking shoulder injury for the unlucky Adam Coleman was a blow, the obvious talent of the the Kiwi-reared Chandler Cunningham-South, still just 19 and part of England’s under-20 squad, Tom Pearson and their Argentinian replacement Juan Martin González bodes well for their play-off prospects. This was the Exiles’ biggest attendance of the season and once the grounds harden up in spring their attacking brand of rugby should be even more watchable. There was also the satisfaction of atoning for their last-gasp defeat against Quins at the end of October with the third-placed Exeter now only three points above them. As well as underlining the competitiveness of this year’s Premiership it also raised further questions about how Quins will fare over the Six Nations period without Marcus Smith and Alex Dombrandt to steer them around the field. “We’re a mid-table side, that’s the brutal reality,” the Quins director of rugby, Tabai Matson, said. Matson also did not dispute the 22nd-minute red card against Lewies, who on the face of it could have no complaints under the laws. His shoulder to the head of a stooping Cunningham-South looked worse with every slow-motion replay and there was no attempt to wrap the arm. Then again, tacklers are not technically supposed to have their heads below waist level, leaving the Quins captain with no real legal target at which to aim. So what was he meant to do? Matson is among those who believe this is the biggest conundrum now facing rugby’s beleaguered guardians. Dykes’s triple whammy, meanwhile, made him only the third player after Gloucester’s Lesley Vainokolo and Northampton’s Courtnal Skosan to score a hat-trick on his Premiership debut. Swift, elusive and with an eye for the line, Dykes had his first try on the board after just seven minutes, courtesy of some slick work inside him, as Quins went 14-0 down quicker than you could say “Not another slow start”. In addition to Cunningham-South’s early score, James Stokes was first to react to a loose ball to register Irish’s third before Dykes, having also served 10 minutes in the sin-bin for failing to intercept a looping ball which also led to a penalty try being awarded, underlined the promise he had shown previously with a hat-trick in a Premiership Cup game against Saracens. Even before Joe Marler departed to the sin-bin, leaving Quins with just 13 players for the final 10 minutes, it was a green day to savour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T00:00:20Z","webTitle":"As Liddell bites the dust, can NSW supply enough power for a looming El Niño summer peak?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","fields":{"bodyText":"AGL Energy’s Liddell coal-fired power station in New South Wales closed on Friday, Australia’s first big power plant closure since Hazelwood’s demise in Victoria in 2017. Liddell had been operating at less than half its original 2,000-megawatt capacity for some time. Still, its exit sharpens the focus on the challenges facing not only NSW but also the rest of the national electricity market (Nem). More closures to come Origin Energy’s black coal-fired Eraring power station is scheduled to be the next to shut, with a planned August 2025 closure. The plant, also in NSW, boasts almost 2,900MW of capacity, making it Australia’s largest. Relatively costly coal contracts, though, mean Eraring is not always raring to go. NSW’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, legislated by the state Coalition government in 2020, is intended to bridge the gap. It aims to attract at least 12 gigawatts of wind and solar farms and 2GW of long-duration storage by 2030. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup However, the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, says “the roadmap has already been tested by the delays in Snowy [Hydro’s 2.0 pumped storage project] and the foreshadowed possible closure of Eraring”. Snowy 2.0 is scheduled to be ready by December 2027 but more than a few – including in NSW – expect more delays. Officials say they expect to have sufficient new generation sources to fill the gaps left by Eraring. Early exits by any of the other plants, though, could stretch supplies. “The government’s approach will be to keep the lights on by getting as much renewable energy into operation as soon as possible, accelerating the roadmap where possible and working with coal-fired operators on their transition to ensure there is enough generation for households and businesses,” Sharpe said. Interstate competition NSW relies on Queensland and Victoria for about 10% of its power. Both states, however, have recently accelerated their own renewables rush, particularly in Queensland, a laggard in the decarbonisation shift. One NSW official said geographic spread should moderate the risks. “It’s really unusual in the [Nem] to have a peak demand event in multiple cities at the same time,” he said this week. Last June, however, saw a widespread cold snap across eastern states that pushed supplies to the brink. Flooding in coalmines and Covid-delayed maintenance at power plants exacerbated the strain, but a similar event this winter could test the grid, now that Liddell is shut and Queensland’s 825MW coal-fired Callide C plant remains out of action after an explosion. Historically, summer provides the peak of power demand and with the looming risk of a powerful El Niño the spike in usage might be particularly sharp later this year. Extra transmission links between states will help, such as the Project EnergyConnect between NSW and South Australia, expected by July 2026. Still, evidence of the ongoing constraints include curbs on existing lines that cut imports by NSW from Victoria by an average 138MW in the first quarter, the Australian Energy Market Operator said on Friday. Renewables (and storage) to the rescue? The great bulk of new investment in the electricity sector is directed to renewable energy since costs are well below alternatives, particularly nuclear, the CSIRO and Aemo say. More clean energy should bring down wholesale prices, as happened in the March quarter, Aemo said on Friday. Renewables now supply about 37% of the Nem’s power, a share that should rise to about 82% by 2030 according to federal goals. Victoria is banking on offshore windfarms to play a big role in supplying its energy. It also has set a target to have enough storage by 2035 to power half the state’s homes. However, the industry is warning that while about 5GW of new solar and windfarms started construction nationwide last year, not a lot of capacity was completed. The pipeline of new projects is also beginning to shrink. Stefan Jarnason, a co-founder of Solar Analytics and an industry veteran, said the NSW government considering an intervention to extend Eraring beyond 2025 will deter renewables investors. “As long as the government’s going ‘maybe we will or maybe we won’t close this 2GW coal-fired power station’, you’re gonna sit on your hands until they give you a firm signal,” he said. Better policy would be to make it easier for households to install rooftop solar – or expand what they have – and even add batteries. “We know that the largest source of new generation every year for the past five years has been rooftop solar and will likely continue to be for the next 30 years,” Jarnson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T19:16:44Z","webTitle":"China ‘increasingly disruptive global power’, says Canadian foreign minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","fields":{"bodyText":"Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, has said China has become “increasingly disruptive” on the world stage as she hinted in a speech at a new Indo-Pacific strategy expected to be released this month. Her comments come ahead of several summits that Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is to attend, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia, the G20 in Indonesia, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Thailand. “China is an increasingly disruptive, global power,” Joly told a Toronto audience. “It seeks to shape the global environment into one that is more permissive for interests and values that increasingly depart from ours. “And China’s rise as a global actor is reshaping the strategic outlook of every state in the region, including Canada.” In an outline of Ottawa’s new policy strategy, which is due to be released in the coming weeks, Joly said it would be critical to expand relations with India and other countries in the region, as well as Taiwan. She did not discourage further trade with China, which has become Canada’s second-largest trading partner, despite strained diplomatic ties. But she warned Canadian firms they “need to be clear-eyed” about doing business in and with China. Her comments came days after Trudeau said that China is “play[ing] aggressive games” to undermine democratic institutions amid reports that Beijing had actively interfered in Canada’s federal elections. His comments on Monday came after reports that Beijing had funded a clandestine network of candidates in Canada’s 2019 election and just days after the federal police force said it was investigating a secret network of illegal Chinese police stations in Toronto. Bilateral relations soured after Canada’s 2018 arrest of a Huawei executive on a US warrant, and Beijing’s detention of two Canadians in apparent retaliation. All three were released last year as part of a deal with US prosecutors. Joly said Canada must continue to deal with China on global issues such as the climate crisis. Notably, China will chair a UN biodiversity conference in Montreal in December. But she promised Ottawa would be vocal on China’s poor treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities, its crushing of free speech in Hong Kong, military threats against Taiwan, and any moves to curtail international navigation rights in the region. She said: “We will challenge China when we ought to. We will cooperate with China when we must.” “The Indo-Pacific region is the epicenter of a generational global shift,” she added, predicting it will account for half of the global economy by 2040. Joly also noted an increased Canadian military presence in the Pacific and promised more staff at its embassies tasked with analysing the impact of Chinese policies. At global forums she said Canada and its allies will be “pushing back against behaviours that undermine international norms”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T12:00:37Z","webTitle":"Absolute power, misconduct and decline: the classical music pieces that unlock Tár","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","fields":{"bodyText":"Earlier this month, director Todd Field was interviewed for Radio 3’s Private Passions about his new film, Tár. The presenter Michael Berkeley had seen it the night before and commented: “It’s the kind of film you want to see with friends and have a good argument about. Is that perhaps what you wanted?” Field replied with a confident “yes” before bursting into laughter. At its root, Tár is a study of power. Field might have conjured up a ruthless politician to make his film about, but he chose to go one step higher – picking a figure of absolutism. It features Cate Blanchett in imperious form playing Lydia Tár, the first female chief conductor of one of the world’s top orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic. A real-life predecessor of the fictional Tár was Herbert von Karajan, who held the helm at the Berlin Philharmonic from 1956 until his death in 1989. Margaret Thatcher admired him greatly and they became friends, no matter that he was a former Nazi party member. “She envied me,” Karajan once said, “that people always did what I requested.” Much is left unsaid in Tár, resulting in a great deal of critical analysis. With regards to the music in the film – or, more specifically, the two works that Lydia Tár intends to conduct with her orchestra – there’s plenty to stew on, too. We hear in an opening scene that she intends to complete a cycle of Mahler’s nine symphonies (10 if you count his unfinished last symphony) by recording a live version of the Fifth. Needing a work to perform on the night alongside the Mahler, she opts for Elgar’s Cello Concerto, allowing her to promote her latest grooming victim, the young Russian cellist Olga Metkina (played by Sophie Kauer), from orchestra newbie to soloist. Tár seems to follow its protagonist’s descent from supreme power to near-irrelevance, her career and private life destroyed by a slew of allegations of misconduct. So why put Mahler’s Fifth at the heart of this psychodrama? Field told the LA Times that it was his “gateway drug into a lot of classical music”, but also that it fitted his narrative. Written in 1901–1902 and premiered in 1904, it’s a five-movement work beginning with a funeral march. “The first movement of the five is about death, and Lydia is undergoing a sort of artistic death, a personal death and a potential rebirth,” Field added. “It’s almost like it’s haunting her, coming for her.” The first movement alone clocks in at 12 or 13 minutes. In the film, there’s much discussion about the different lengths at which conductors play the famous fourth movement, the Adagietto (anywhere between seven and 12 minutes). In total, the symphony runs for well over an hour, pulling in many sonic and thematic directions. It’s a wide-open work, ripe for individual interpretation and impeccably suiting a film that doesn’t provide easy answers. Mahler said: “A symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.” He was caught on the cusp of the Romantic period in music and the forward charge of modernism. His symphonies both look back and drive onward, creating ambiguity, consciously and subconsciously. “Music, before Mahler, had a lexicon of simple emotions: joy, sorrow, love, hate, uplift, downcast, beauty, ugliness, and so on,” music critic Norman Lebrecht wrote in his 2010 book, Why Mahler? “Mahler, in his First Symphony, introduced the possibility of parallel meanings.” Mahler met and married his wife Alma, also a composer, while writing his Fifth symphony. The Adagietto is his love letter, but that’s not how it’s always perceived. In the film, Lydia Tár is portrayed as the protege of the American conductor Leonard Bernstein. In 1968, Bernstein conducted the Adagietto at Robert F Kennedy’s funeral – performing it like “a mass’’, as Tár says – which began the process of it becoming an American national anthem of mourning. Post-9/11, it was played repeatedly by orchestras and radio DJs across the US. After her brother-in-law’s funeral, Jackie Kennedy wrote to Bernstein: “When your Mahler started to fill (but that is the wrong word – because it was more this sensitive trembling) the cathedral today – I thought it was the most beautiful music I had ever heard. I am so glad I didn’t know it – it was this strange music of all the gods who were crying …” Such is the power of Mahler’s Fifth, a piece that becomes reborn each time new listeners stumble upon it. Field told Private Passions that the first time he heard the work he thought he’d “personally discovered it”. Mikhail Gorbachev, who first heard it in 1991, commented: “I had the feeling that Mahler’s music somehow touched our situation, about the period of perestroika with all its passions and struggles.” It’s an irony of both Mahler’s Fifth and Elgar’s Cello Concerto (1919) that they barely resonated when composed, percolated over time and then came into dazzling fruition in the 1960s. Bernstein was essential to Mahler’s success in the second half of the 20th century; Elgar has an English cellist, Jacqueline du Pré, to thank for turning a failure into a standard. Her electrifying, boundless 1965 performance of the concerto – recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by John Barbirolli when Du Pré was 20 – transcended genre. It hit the zeitgeist, sold like a pop record and made a star of Du Pré. Her death in 1987, aged 42, after multiple sclerosis had ended her performing career 14 years earlier, remains one of English classical music’s most appalling tragedies. In Tár, the blackly comic character of Olga Metkina says she was introduced to the Elgar Cello Concerto by Du Pré, but through a live performance on YouTube, not the recording. There is a correlation between the free-spirited natures of Metkina and Du Pré, but you guess also that Field specifically needed Elgar’s Cello Concerto in his film. Like Mahler’s Fifth, it’s a wildly popular piece frequently used by Hollywood, thereby providing a reachable access point for anyone new to classical music. But perhaps there’s further intent on Field’s part. Like Tár, whose affection for the old masters is scoffed at by progressive students in a class she teaches at New York’s Juilliard school, so Elgar was written off as stuffy, reactionary and provincial – later in his own career and in the decades that followed his death in 1934. By the time Elgar began writing his Cello Concerto in the aftermath of the first world war, he was already considered old-hat and he knew it. Furthermore, the carnage of war had affected him deeply and his beloved wife Alice was ill (she would soon die). He was lonely, depressed and he wouldn’t go on to write another major orchestral work. Later, when preparing a catalogue of his music, he wrote “Finis RIP” next to the Concerto, although he lived for 15 more years and published many more, smaller pieces. The plaintive, autumnal concerto is considered to be a lament for war, but perhaps Elgar was writing a requiem for his own death. In that sense, it couldn’t more perfectly suit Field’s narrative arc for Lydia Tár as she unwittingly orchestrates her own demise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant approval faces legal challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","fields":{"bodyText":"Campaigners have begun a legal challenge against the government’s decision to give the Sizewell C nuclear power station the go-ahead amid warnings that UK nuclear plants will be on the frontline of climate breakdown. Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK’s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: “The case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. “Even to consider building a £20bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.” The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK’s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: “It’s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.” Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: “We are proud to represent TASC in the local community’s continued fight to help protect Suffolk’s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court’s attention.” The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. • This article was amended on 8 August 2022.

The building at 740 Park Avenue has been home to John D Rockefeller Jr, Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, David Koch of the Koch brothers and Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin. An apartment in the building currently on the market is going for $27.5m. Umbrellas up, outside the building, the lawmakers promised to fight to ensure the wealthy in New York are fairly taxed. “A little rain is not going to stop us and neither are decades of trickle-down economics,” said Jabari Brisport, a state senator. Lawmakers across seven states, including New York, are working together to introduce higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations in their respective legislatures. Along with New York, legislators from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland and Washington have been working on bills that would increase taxes for the wealthy living in their states. Many of the new proposals include taxes on the overall wealth of the rich, not just on their annual income. In 2021, ProPublica released a report based off a trove of tax documents from the wealthy that showed how the rich avoid paying income tax. It showed that in some years, the wealthiest billionaires sometimes avoided income tax altogether by holding and adding to their wealth through stock and property ownership, which are taxed at lower rates than income. Joe Biden introduced a 20% “wealth tax” at the federal level, which would apply toward an individual “total income”, including growth in their assets like stocks, when proposing his budget last spring. But with Republicans showing no interest in wealth taxes, progressives are hoping that taxes on the super wealthy can happen at the state level. In New York, progressive lawmakers are looking to pass the Invest in New York package, which will include a slate of tax reforms on extreme wealth. The tax reform includes adding new tax brackets for the highest earners, higher corporate taxes for the wealthiest companies and wealth taxes on capital gains, including unrealized capital gains, and inheritance. Over a dozen state senators have signed on to the proposal. “We are tired of subsidizing billionaires here in New York. For a long time, we see how they underpay employees at work and then at home, the workers who help them are also unpaid,” said state senator Jessica Ramos, who is proposing a tax on unrealized capital gains. “When that happens, we end up having to step up with services to help those families make ends meet.” State senator Gustavo Rivera, who is proposing higher taxes on long-term capital gains, said the lawmakers are unconcerned about the wealthy leaving New York, a point often brought up by opponents of a wealth tax. “This notion that they will leave is not true. It does not happen. They live here, they have Broadway, they have restaurants, they have culture, they have Central Park. They’re not going to move,” Rivera said. Activists and lawmakers at Thursday’s rally called on the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to work with them to pass higher wealth taxes. Hochul last month said she did not think raising taxes “makes sense” after the state passed tax cuts, primarily aimed at the middle class, last year. “I don’t believe that raising taxes, at a time when we just cut taxes, makes sense,” she said in December. “We are not going to turn around and say last year we lowered your taxes, now we are raising them. So, I don’t foresee that.” Thursday’s rally and the unveiling of the wealth taxes across the blue states coincided with Wednesday’s release of a letter from 205 members of the global super-rich elite who called on governments around the world to “tax us, the ultra rich, now”. The letter signers, including Abigail Disney and actor Mark Ruffalo, urged lawmakers to “tackle extreme wealth” via taxes. “Defending democracy and building cooperation requires action to build fairer economies to build fairer economies right now – it is not a problem that can be left for our children to fix,” the letter said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
